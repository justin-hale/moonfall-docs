-

(Justin Hale)
god.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
(Justin Hale)
Okay. Stupid filters. Where is the background thing? No. No one. No

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
(Tyram)
can't that I didn't see what that was. What was
-

(Christopher Hooper)
one.

(Justin Hale)
size. Do

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
(Justin Hale)
what? Oh, that time I got reincarnated of the

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
(Justin Hale)
slime. Um, books are like legit books on

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
(Justin Hale)
here. Like fullon whole ass pages. That's

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
(Justin Hale)
amazing. And then the processor in this thing is stupid

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
(Justin Hale)
quick because I can do really dumb stuff

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
(Tyram)
it?
-

(Justin Hale)
like this.

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
(Justin Hale)
Hold

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
(Tyram)
Well, while you're doing that, there is something I wanted to ask the two of you.

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
(Tyram)
Oh, cool. Like a DS
-

(Justin Hale)
on.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
(Justin Hale)
3DS emulation and it's like perfect. It hardly stutters

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
(Tyram)
emulator.
-

(Justin Hale)
at all. It's it I'm I'm blown away

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
(Tyram)
Well, well
-

(Justin Hale)
because 3DS is like notoriously hard to emulate.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
(Tyram)
done. Oh, but um so next week we're scheduled

39

(Tyram)
Okay.

Okay. Just wanted to make

Great

(Justin Hale)
Cleric. I've been reading some

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
(Justin Hale)
uh Korean mangas, too. I've been way

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
(Tyram)
Okay. I'm

(Justin Hale)
end. Can't remember what the other one I was reading

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
(Tyram)
mostly just a basic b**** when it comes to manga. I just mostly read things like
-

(Justin Hale)
was

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
(Tyram)
One

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
(Justin Hale)
through Dragon Ball Super like a like a

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
(Justin Hale)
generic manga person and they stopped making it.

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
(Justin Hale)
before he died. They stopped making it before

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
(Justin Hale)

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
(Tyram)
Piece.

Uh, Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball Z or Dragon Ball in

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
good.

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
(Justin Hale)
general, he died oh gosh, three years ago

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh, okay. Is that
-

(Justin Hale)
now.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
(Justin Hale)
Right. When did he die? Let's

(Justin Hale)
Mine has not been

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Same must be nice.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Busy.
-

(Justin Hale)
busy. Well, uh,

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
(Justin Hale)
I showed up to work Monday morning to, uh, my

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh
-

(Ellis Taylor)
screaming. Oh
-

(Justin Hale)
manager's account being deactivated and I was like,

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
no. Does it turn
-

(Justin Hale)
"Oh, that's weird. What happened?" And then I was talking to co-workers and they were like,

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
in?
-

(Justin Hale)
"I don't know. I don't I don't see him anywhere. I don't see him in like the directory or

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
(Tyram)
him.
-

(Justin Hale)
anything." And uh, then we were were talking to some other groups

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
no.
-

(Justin Hale)
and their managers got terminated and we were like, "Uh, what's

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
(Justin Hale)
going on?" So turns out Assurian cut 15%

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Justin Hale)
more of their uh of their workforce

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
huge. 15%. God damn. At
-

(Justin Hale)
restructuring.

91
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
least it wasn't you again, you
-

(Justin Hale)
Yep. Well, right. It was

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
(Justin Hale)
a what, a year ago that um I got laid off during a

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
(Justin Hale)
25% cut of the company. I got hired back a week later, but still

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
know?
-

(Justin Hale)
like they cut 25% of the company. So we're up to what 40%

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Justin Hale)
from

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
massive. Is the Aurian product is what?
-

(Justin Hale)
them.

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Uh insurance for electronic stuff. Is that right?
-

(Justin Hale)
Yeah.

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
(Justin Hale)
Yeah. They're having a bit of an identity crisis at the moment

99
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Everything.
-

(Justin Hale)
because they're they're trying to branch out, you know, as

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Okay.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
I want
-

(Justin Hale)
public corporate companies do. They have to continue their bottom line.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
(Justin Hale)
So guess they are still the backbone

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
(Justin Hale)
for most of the big uh uh

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
(Justin Hale)
cell phone carriers. But now if you buy something on like

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
you to get rid
-

(Justin Hale)
Amazon, you'll sometimes get a popup saying like do you want to get insurance by a

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
(Justin Hale)
shurion? And then what else are they

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
(Justin Hale)
offered on? Like it's the most random things that you can

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
(Justin Hale)
get covered. Oh, if you get like

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
(Justin Hale)
um like that home insurance like inhome insurance stuff. So like when you buy like a

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
washer and dryer or a fridge or any like hey we'll sell you this

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
(Justin Hale)
insurance that takes care of all of the appliances in your house. That's

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Is that a recent
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Shin strongest.
-

(Justin Hale)
usually through a sharing now too.

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
(Justin Hale)
Uh it's been a few years. It's been like three years now that they've

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
(Justin Hale)
been doing that. But keep pivoting to those things.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
(Justin Hale)
Uh I think because they're a little scared of of not

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
(Justin Hale)
um padded by the the mobile

116
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
change? Yeah. I
-

(Ellis Taylor)
But I'm
-

(Justin Hale)
insurance business. They lost Sprint when that

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
so
-

(Justin Hale)
merger with T-Mobile happened and then T-Mobile didn't renew the contract. They don't have

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
She's angry.
-

(Justin Hale)
T-Mobile business at all. So, all they have is like Verizon and

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
mean, right.
-

(Justin Hale)
AT&T and any of their like

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah. Okay. Huh.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I mean, I understand the diversification, not wanting to have a single cash cow

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
of whatever,
-

(Justin Hale)
subsidies.

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
but Huh.
-

(Justin Hale)
Sure. I mean, so Sherian's been around

124
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I'm sure everything will be
-

(Justin Hale)
since the the early 2000s, I think. They kind of been

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
right when
-

(Justin Hale)
resting on their laurels for the past what, 20

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
cell phones were really just taking off. I'm guessing that was
-

(Ellis Taylor)
fine.
-

(Justin Hale)
years.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
(Justin Hale)
Yeah. Uh this is all they've been doing

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
question.
-

(Justin Hale)
until I mean basically when I started back in 2020. So

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I wonder how much
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Another
-

(Justin Hale)
like

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
like uh like iPhone build

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
quality has like really messed up
-

(Ellis Taylor)
life. We're seeing

132
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh Aurian's like uh like money
-

(Ellis Taylor)
you.

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
plan
-

(Justin Hale)
they

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
cuz I feel like phones used to break like so so

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
easily and now like they're like really hardy Like

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you really got to like drop it on

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
like at the right angle on like concrete or

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
We like to thank our sponsor
-

(Christopher Hooper)
something like
-

(Justin Hale)
Right.

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Apple. They're really wellbuilt
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that. And Gorilla

140
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
phones.
-

(Justin Hale)
The biggest swing there though is that

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Sorry.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Glass.
-

(Justin Hale)
um phones cost way more now and they cost way more

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, he's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh yeah, that's
-

(Justin Hale)
to people people are getting

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
true.
-

(Justin Hale)
insurance because they pretty much can't afford it if their phone

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
(Justin Hale)
breaks. You know, before it was like

145
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
(Justin Hale)
meh, you know, kind of half and half, but like I broke my

146
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
(Justin Hale)
iPhone and uh it um it

147
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
sure. Wow, that's might as well
-

(Justin Hale)
cost me $300 to fix

148
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
buy a new phone at that point.
-

(Justin Hale)
it. I mean, it's a

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
(Tyram)
I have to
-

(Luke Neverisky)
I take it
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Did
-

(Justin Hale)
$1,200 phone, so

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
(Tyram)
say, yeah, that is much more affordable than getting a new phone, which I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you just
-

(Justin Hale)
do

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
(Tyram)
guess uh kind of goes with Justin's point there.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
back. Yeah, you can
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Did you just
-

(Justin Hale)
I

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
repair it with like DS

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
(Tyram)
But
-

(Justin Hale)
still I took it to a local repair shop to do that work on

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
tell.
-

(Justin Hale)
it though because like my uh

155
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
parts?
-

(Justin Hale)
eventual like trade in or or private selling of

156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
(Justin Hale)
that phone will still be more than what it

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Are
-

(Justin Hale)
costs to repair it. But I wasn't going to go buy a new

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
(Justin Hale)
iPhone. Like if the iPhone F was coming out, I wouldn't have fixed my

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
(Justin Hale)
my current phone. Like if the iPhone F was already out, I would have just bought that

160
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
(Justin Hale)
instead. But rather than do all that, I'm going to fix this

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you
-

(Justin Hale)
iPhone and then use that as trade in towards the iPhone F when that comes

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
(Justin Hale)
out

163
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Interesting. Yeah, the

164
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
phone you sent me a picture of last night. f******
-

(Justin Hale)
if Yeah, dude. I love

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
(Tyram)
I don't see Oh, all did. I was about to ask
-

(Luke Neverisky)
huge.
-

(Justin Hale)
this thing. It's great.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
(Tyram)
if Ally ever responded, but never mind. Here's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
She's

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
(Tyram)
Ally. That's even better than Ally
-

(Christopher Hooper)
here. Here she

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
(Tyram)
responding. No, he's
-

(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is. Yeah. And Zach's not here tonight. So, this is the whole

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
game.
-

(Justin Hale)
Luke, here's your comparison to

170
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
(Tyram)
not.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
right. Oh, okay. That's okay. It It was bigger in the

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
photo
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Come
-

(Justin Hale)
scale.

172
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
maybe.
-

(Justin Hale)
big for a phone standards, but yeah, it's

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
(Tyram)
Oh, but Justin, have you mastered igloo making
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah. Oh

(Justin Hale)
today. I mean, not recently.

178
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
(Justin Hale)
No, I can all but guarantee that my old house did not have power like

179
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
(Justin Hale)
the minute everyone was losing power and they were probably the last ones to get power

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
yet? That's good. All
-

That's

Excellent
-

(Justin Hale)
this

236
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
(Justin Hale)
week. That's been a fun one to

237
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
one. We use like anatomically correct words with Are we
-

(Justin Hale)

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000

-

(Ellis Taylor)
sake, but he knows the word penis as well and talks about it quite

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
(Justin Hale)
then uh Christina was watching a legal video

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Interesting.

(Justin Hale)

(Ali Leonard)

You. I'm sure I still have my copy of Mom and Dad's House. I'll send it to

(Ellis Taylor)
Everyone's
-

(Justin Hale)
uh made the mistake of uh
-

(Ali Leonard)
you.

249
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
(Justin Hale)
saying, "You guys got to stop crawling over me. You're hitting me in the

250
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
(Justin Hale)
junk. how she asks what

251
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
favorite
-

(Justin Hale)
everyone's junk
-

(Ali Leonard)
Sure. I mean, everybody's got a different

252
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
(Justin Hale)
is and that that's kind of what sparked all of

253
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
this.
-

(Ali Leonard)
joke. At least she's respectful about

254
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
(Tyram)
Could be worse.
-

(Justin Hale)
Yeah, very
-

(Ali Leonard)
it.

255
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
There are things you want to

256
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
these
-

(Justin Hale)
true.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, how's everyone doing? Everyone

257
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
(Tyram)
Heck
-

(Luke Neverisky)
I think we're
-

(Ellis Taylor)
guys.
-

(Justin Hale)
Born
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ready?

258
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
ready. Yep. South the womb.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You were born

259
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
(Tyram)
yeah. We've got some dragons to
-

(Justin Hale)
Ready to go.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ready.

260
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
(Tyram)
contend with, it
-

(Luke Neverisky)
ready.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Wow.
-

(Ali Leonard)
do.

261
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
(Tyram)
seems.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, that sounds

262
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
(Justin Hale)
Where are
-

(Ali Leonard)
Like he didn't invent

263
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
(Justin Hale)
you? That's entirely up to you,

264
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
(Tyram)
Sounds like a real harrowing encounter, if I do say so
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm. Baby
-

(Justin Hale)
sir.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dangerous. What's that?

265
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
is the winner.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
All right.
-

(Ali Leonard)
it.

266
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
So, um, last we left

267
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
(Tyram)
myself.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
off, um, we had
-

(Ali Leonard)
dream of a reality.

268
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
a little conversation with Bafael on the ship,
-

(Ali Leonard)
One of our ice trucks.

269
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh, where he really he really

270
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
he really put y'all through the ringer, if I have to say so myself,

271
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
questioning your ethics and, you know, what you're really doing,

272
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Oh
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you know. Um,

273
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
no, we couldn't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
and you know, I think I think it was a healing uh

274
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
possibly
-

(Christopher Hooper)
experience where everyone reflected on their on their

275
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
beliefs and what they're actually trying to do.

276
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and importantly, there was

277
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
an arm wrestling uh competition that served

278
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
as an immaculate distraction

279
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
for a sensor relay.

280
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um sabotage and not only

281
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sabotage but uh what pirating or what

282
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
would you call when you like hijacking of the

283
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sensor uh signal
-

(Ali Leonard)
We hacked the main frame and that's really all you need to

284
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
(Tyram)
They did the
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yep. Beep. Boop.
-

(Justin Hale)
We
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you hack the main frame. Exactly. Yeah. Boop
-

(Ali Leonard)
know.

285
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
(Tyram)
clackity clack, you know, on the computer pieces and just, you

286
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Boop.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
boop as a racist does and

287
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
(Tyram)
know, she's not just a racist. She's an
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh bada bing bada boom

288
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
(Tyram)
artificer and a paladin, which is not relevant, but she is an

289
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
(Tyram)
artificer.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Mhm.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
done. I think I mean she's a paladin to her

290
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
engineering beliefs,
-

(Ali Leonard)
Yeah. So, it's like on

291
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right?
-

(Ali Leonard)
minor and and then it's all

292
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
If my understanding is correctly, your

293
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
paladin nature is your extreme devotion towards

294
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
engineering.
-

(Ali Leonard)
connected. Got to go fast. Yeah.

295
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
(Tyram)
Oh, kinderg being Sonic the
-

(Ali Leonard)
His name is

296
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
(Tyram)
Hedgehog. Only the
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Don't need a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. His name is Tony and he's a real god.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Tony. And he's

297
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
he's definitely a real god and not just a

298
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
(Tyram)
Hedgehog.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
headshot.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Sounds like a
-

(Justin Hale)
sounds like a cult. If
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

299
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
It's definitely
-

(Ellis Taylor)
cult.
-

(Justin Hale)
you if you have to preface that it's not a cult, it's usually a
-

(Ali Leonard)
cult. You guys said it

300
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
(Tyram)
I mean, if
-

(Justin Hale)
cult.
-

(Ali Leonard)
wasn't a cult and it was fine. So that's what I'm going on the belief

301
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
(Tyram)
we can't believe people who might be in a cult, who is there to believe in? You
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Y'all
-

(Ali Leonard)
of.

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
think Y'all think everyone who's religious is

303
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
(Tyram)
know, I don't think um I don't think Olivia's cultish.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cultish? Beldorans, the
-

(Ali Leonard)
vector in the

304
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
(Tyram)
She's like the most laxidasical paladin I've ever seen about

305
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
(Tyram)
Fis.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah, she's like I mean we had that
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Tonius. Yeah, she is barely religious.
-

(Ali Leonard)
orange this

306
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
conversation in the beginning toer. I was like, she's going to be barely

307
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah. Paladin was a choice,
-

(Ali Leonard)
weekend driver

308
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
(Tyram)
Jesus
-

(Ellis Taylor)
religious.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
but you know, it's fine.
-

(Ali Leonard)
that's 60 58 years of

309
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
She's culturally tier.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and
-

(Ali Leonard)
age

310
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Mhm. I feel like your devotion is towards justice.

311
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. Yeah. And so by
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, which aligns with uh
-

(Ali Leonard)
couple. It's like when your

312
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
(Tyram)
Christ.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
proxy, that's how Keith
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.
-

(Ali Leonard)
parents are Methodist and you're like, I guess I'll be

313
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
calls himself culturally Jewish. Like going to go to temple.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Methodist.

314
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
But he's Jewish.

315
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and channel devotion is kind of just like a you
-

(Ali Leonard)
Yeah.

316
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah. Tier
-

(Christopher Hooper)
know I guess I'm devoted.

317
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
gets it. We've got it. We got to figure it
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um I am an agent of

318
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
tier but we don't need to do a bunch of ceremony around it.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Watch the

319
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
(Tyram)
Sorry.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
out. Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, leave that to the clerics.
-

(Ali Leonard)
event today was fast.

320
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Exactly.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, so yeah, that was great. Um, and then y'all landed at

321
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
the crash site and um, Toeer the

322
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
DM supplied a really cool uh, battle map

323
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
from Chepoku of the

324
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Just
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh, Luna the Fallen Moon. And that's one of my favorite

325
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
battle maps I've ever found. And that's why I shoehorned it in

326
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Hell
-

(Ellis Taylor)
like
-

(Christopher Hooper)
to this plot.

327
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
yeah. I love
-

(Ellis Taylor)
cool.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and uh, we did a ritual at

328
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
that.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
the Crown of Luna, and I feel like we learned some

329
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
(Justin Hale)
Nothing. Not a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
things. Did we learn some things up there,

330
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
(Tyram)
like Luna's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
She's talking. We learned that much.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
too? Okay, there was some

331
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
(Tyram)
alive even though she's a skeleton. I guess that's something we learned.

332
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
(Justin Hale)
thing. Learning is for chumps.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
talking. Yeah, there's a little bit of a weak

333
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
(Tyram)
Um, so yeah,
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
She's We're going to try to revivify
-

(Christopher Hooper)
presence there. Um,

334
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
(Tyram)
I feel like we should try to talk to Luna. It should be something on the uh something on the agenda
-

(Ellis Taylor)
her.

335
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
(Tyram)
today for sure. If f****** revivify works, then that all

336
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
(Tyram)
these f****** uh monks have really

337
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
(Tyram)
overstressed the amount of work that needed to be done
-

(Christopher Hooper)
and I

338
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
(Tyram)
here.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
mean what uh what level monk gets

339
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
(Tyram)
Well, they don't. Then riff rify also specifically says you
-

(Christopher Hooper)
revivify?

340
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
(Tyram)
have to do it within like a minute of them dying. Uh but if we had like raise

341
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
(Tyram)
dead, which I don't think anyone
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah. Is she dead though?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Isn't raised dead like raising as

342
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, she
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Is she dead
-

(Christopher Hooper)
a

343
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
(Tyram)
does. I don't know. We we can literally ask her. So yeah,
-

(Luke Neverisky)
can communicate, right?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, that's true. What if she was just sitting on like one

344
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
(Tyram)
we can we can get to the bottom of this. Or rather, I should say Silus and Brew can
-

(Christopher Hooper)
hits hit point, you know, just

345
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
(Tyram)
get to the bottom of this since, you know, we got the world's greatest detectives on the site.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, thank

346
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
(Justin Hale)
What what is death really? You know, when it really
-

(Christopher Hooper)
needed

347
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
though? Hey, bud.
-

(Justin Hale)
comes How do you
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. What is death to a god?

348
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
God.
-

(Justin Hale)
quantify or qualify death in this scenario?

349
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and speaking of uh interacting with godly beings

350
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
to your own bodily detriment, um,

351
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
better than
-

(Justin Hale)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
y'all did the rebinding spell on the orb.

352
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
you've
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and y'all rolled really well, like most

353
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
of the time. um except for Luke

354
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
or rather uh Toeer playing and rolling as

355
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
as Luke as uh Liliana. Um and

356
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
disgusting
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I think like you're what uh you're

357
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh, then I should detract that from
-

(Christopher Hooper)
missing some health points I

358
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
my character sheet.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
believe. I think it's on your character

359
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
demon.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
sheet. Are you missing health

360
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Okay. Yeah. 45 out of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
points? Yeah.

361
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
57.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. And I think you were the only one that was damaged

362
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Awesome. You know, that's honestly I'm glad
-

(Christopher Hooper)
during the ritual, so appropriate.

363
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
none of my friends got hurt.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and that should

364
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
teach everyone who ever skips out on a lesson. I will

365
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
So, never f****** leave
-

(Christopher Hooper)
kill you or hurt you while you're gone. Okay.

366
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
us
-

(Ellis Taylor)
cold. Character is not safe while you're gone.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um

367
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
(Tyram)
I mean, I always assume that. That's why I try to never
-

(Luke Neverisky)
again.

368
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um yeah.

369
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
(Tyram)
miss.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um and so you completed the ritual and the last

370
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Cool.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
thing you uh you heard were shouts from the

371
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
(Justin Hale)
Damn.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ship as people said, "We got a live one." and

372
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you saw um uh ropes

373
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh firing up into the air, catching hold of an

374
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
adult blue dragon flying above you.

375
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um and that's where we'll start. Um

376
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
so I think if you want to do any communing, uh

377
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it will be under duress. Uh let's see. We're going to

378
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
do we're not going to go into initiative order unless y'all want

379
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
to. Um, but who would like to act

380
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I'm gonna immediately summon Bob
-

(Christopher Hooper)
first? All right, you're summoning

381
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Bob. We'll put we'll put you we'll put you up front here. So, you're summoning

382
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
just
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Bob. Uh, what are you what are you doing? What do you think uh you're doing along

383
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I'm hopping on him and trying to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
with

384
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
figure out how we can get up in the air to attack the

385
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
(Tyram)
Like how far the
-

(Ellis Taylor)
dragons.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that? Yeah, good

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
(Tyram)
dragon's like up above the the surface of the ocean,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
question.

387
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah. How far up are they?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, that's a

388
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
great question. So, they are high above

389
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
(Tyram)
right?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you, but probably only they are

390
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
flying like they're

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
probably let's see. So, the ocean wall is

392
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
about 300 ft. So, they are

393
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
skimming just above that. Um, so they're they're

394
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
flying very low because because you're

395
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you're kind of the the point of interest. Uh, which is why the

396
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
grappler grappling hooks were able to to reach

397
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
them. Um, actually, uh, you know,

398
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Olivia, go ahead and give me a perception

399
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Don't do
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. It's so
-

(Justin Hale)
Do it. Do
-

(Christopher Hooper)
check.

400
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
bad.
-

(Justin Hale)
it.

401
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
five. Um you

402
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
it.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
see a wall of water and

403
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Five
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um what you do notice is

404
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um what do you notice with

405
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Not
-

(Christopher Hooper)
the five? You notice a little

406
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
bit there's an anchor coming off the

407
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
ship and that and you kind of see that and it's like that's

408
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
much.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
the most straightforward way to get back up probably. Um it is

409
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
within the water but like just like on the

410
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Do I have
-

(Christopher Hooper)
other side of that um wall of

411
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
to like jump into the water to grab the anchor and go

412
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
up? Is that what you're saying?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
water. Um you could do that.

413
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Or didn't we come down
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Didn't aren't Olivia and I

414
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
ropes? We
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So, Oh,
-

(Ali Leonard)
wearing life vests or are we wearing

415
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
that's right. You were the ones that made sure you're wearing life vest. That's

416
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
are. Yes. We're
-

(Christopher Hooper)
right. Oh my gosh. Holy s***.
-

(Ali Leonard)
ropes? So, we can water and just

417
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
safe. Is the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Um,
-

(Ali Leonard)
we can just float up to the top.

418
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
water going up or down? Is the water flowing
-

(Christopher Hooper)
yeah. Yeah, that's

419
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right. The

420
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
it.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
water. The water is

421
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
up? Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh not not moving. I mean,

422
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it's moving in like an ocean does, but like it's not

423
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
okay. It's not like flowing. It's just kind of stat. Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
going up or down. It's

424
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
fun. Yeah, we could just float
-

(Christopher Hooper)
just it's it's basically swirling um almost
-

(Ali Leonard)
Right.

425
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
like a like a whirlpool without the

426
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yes. Okay, I got
-

(Christopher Hooper)
center, if that makes sense.

427
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
you.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
up. Hey, bud. You can't open grapes. You got to bite it.

428
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. Sorry, I have to explain
-

(Justin Hale)
Not with that

429
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
grapes. He asked me to open a grape. I'm
-

(Justin Hale)
attitude. You
-

(Ali Leonard)
Talk to a Michelin star chef about peeling

430
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
like, probably because we normally have
-

(Justin Hale)
can't rip rip that grape
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Um, you just swallow them whole and then

431
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, this is the
-

(Ellis Taylor)
them. Yes, that's exactly how they
-

(Christopher Hooper)
choke on
-

(Ali Leonard)
grapes.

432
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
(Justin Hale)
open. Legitimately, Olly used to eat

433
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
work.

(Tyram)
it.

(Luke Neverisky)
so.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah, but we're not going through pressure difference.

(Luke Neverisky)
That's true. That's true.

(Christopher Hooper)
Well, if you got if you got pressure,

448
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it would be at the very bottom, right? As soon as you crossed over, you'd immediately

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
everybody? Where does she leave
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Luke? Uh everyone else is at the head of this

473
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
fallen angel and uh around the ritual

474
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
site. Um so

475
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
up? Made
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh let's see what what are our DCs here?

476
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, you all made it. Wow, great job.

477
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
it.
-

(Justin Hale)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, cool. Uh, so

478
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
if you made it, you receive half damage.

479
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
So you receive uh 30 lightning damage. I believe the

480
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
(Tyram)
Yeah,
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Whoa.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
rogue the rogue do you receive none? Is that right on a

481
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
(Tyram)
I have a I evasion means I save for full instead of save for
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dexterity

482
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
(Tyram)
half. Just
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Wait, all of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
save? Okay, cool.

483
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
(Tyram)
me.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
us? No, no, no. All of us received damage. What was it?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Nope. No.

484
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
(Tyram)
Oh. Um uh Elizabeth and Olivia should be
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Water crew

485
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
(Tyram)
fine
-

(Ellis Taylor)
37. Oh,

486
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
30.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Who's going

487
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
(Justin Hale)
I'm still trying to figure out the damage. So 15 unless I can negate

488
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Um, what was
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Come
-

(Christopher Hooper)
next? No. Uh, 30 was the half

489
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
that? Yeah,
-

(Justin Hale)
it. 30 was the half. s***.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
already. Yeah, 30 was the half.

490
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
(Tyram)
apparently. Adult dragon breath weapons.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
thought I made that.

491
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
(Tyram)
Yeah.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Uh, I'm trying to orient myself here. So, do we have a

492
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
picture or an image or just or I guess I can look at the Discord image. Let's
-

(Christopher Hooper)

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you didn't get to see it yesterday and it's really

495
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
(Tyram)
Well, none of us got to see it
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool. That's true. Last

496
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh,

(Luke Neverisky)
that's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um at the top of the crown here and basically the

498
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
okay. Ah, okay. Got
-

(Christopher Hooper)
border is walls of

499
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
it.
-

(Justin Hale)
What kind of damage was

500
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Lightning.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
water

501
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
(Justin Hale)
that?

502
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
So, and I've and so um Elizabeth and Olivia
-

(Ellis Taylor)
You can't talk about your
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay.

503
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
have gone up the side of the wall, the water wall.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
lightning. Yes.

504
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Okay.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
parents. That's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Uh

505
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um Luke, I will give you the

506
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
option to give me a in

507
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
character plus luck decision of whether you think

508
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Liliana would get would have gotten a life vest

509
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh, she absolutely would have because I mean she
-

(Christopher Hooper)
on.

510
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
grew up sheltered and uh um you know
-

(Ellis Taylor)
one.

511
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
she's not a risk taker and decision
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, that was my feeling

512
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
her decision to do the wall effect was out of was weird for her.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
She

513
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
(Tyram)
Okay. Okay. Um, Silus is

514
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
(Tyram)
um is going to be like rude and um are Livia or Ellmith

515
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
(Tyram)
still within like u range of me? Like how

516
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
(Tyram)
far away they are they from me right now?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
too. Um, they've run ahead

517
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
to the water wall. Um, so they're just about to enter. Uh, they're

518
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
probably
-

(Christopher Hooper)
probably uh they're probably about 90 ft

519
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
(Tyram)
Okay. Um, I'm going to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
away

520
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
(Tyram)
move closer to them with my 30 foot move speed here. And then I'm going to try

521
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
(Tyram)
to teleport and just like velcro myself to probably Olivia

522
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
(Tyram)
because she's stronger. And then just kind of like go up with
-

(Christopher Hooper)
now.

523
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
(Tyram)
them.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, cool. for that. Um, why don't we do uh another

524
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
for both of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dexterity saving

525
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
us. Or should I do a strength jack to see if I catch

526
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
him? Or if he's just teleporting and grabbing onto my
-

(Christopher Hooper)
throw? Um, yeah. I I think

527
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
with that I think with that five perception you you don't see him

528
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
straps.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
behind him behind you. You are like

529
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
(Tyram)
What? I don't need her to do anything. I can
-

(Christopher Hooper)
just like well I got a life so I'm going to float to the

530
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
(Tyram)
just stick to her. I have my spider
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Cool. You have a Velcro
-

(Christopher Hooper)
top.

531
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
(Tyram)
climb thing. I can just stick to
-

(Ellis Taylor)
ability. Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. So, you just need

532
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
to the the dexterity saving throw is to get to her before she

533
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
(Tyram)
her. Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
launches into the

534
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
(Tyram)
Um uh
-

(Christopher Hooper)
air. Yep. Cool.

535
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, yeah. So, DC16, uh, you,

536
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh, uh, fully wrap around her with your, uh, spider climb

537
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
(Tyram)
19
-

(Christopher Hooper)
stuff. Um, Liliana, you have a life vest. You shoot up ahead.

538
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Peru, want to give you a chance to act before I hurt

539
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
You know
-

(Justin Hale)
So, we're we're in the water,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you. Uh,

540
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
(Tyram)
I think everyone but you is
-

(Justin Hale)
right?

541
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
(Justin Hale)
Oh, so I So, we're trying

542
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
(Tyram)
now. Well, I'm trying to just get
-

(Justin Hale)
to get in the water. Is that what the case is

543
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
(Tyram)
out of the the firing range here. So yeah, I'm
-

(Ellis Taylor)
what?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
no.

544
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
(Tyram)
uh like suddenly Olivia just feels like a
-

(Justin Hale)
then?

545
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
(Tyram)
halfling's weight like sticking to her back, I

546
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
(Justin Hale)
Um,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. So, so uh to re to

547
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
reexlain the the setting, right? So, there is this

548
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um fallen Luna. She uh around her

549
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
(Tyram)
guess.
-

(Justin Hale)
okay. All
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is uh completely dry ocean bed and then

550
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
(Justin Hale)
right.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
a wall of ocean. And so everyone is running towards

551
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
one of the walls of the ocean and floating up with their life

552
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Um, I have a question. Is anyone
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
vest right

553
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
running? Oh, never mind. You've got an
-

(Christopher Hooper)
now. Um, yeah,

554
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
idea.
-

(Justin Hale)
So, um
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I'm going to let Brew finish. Go

555
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
I'm gonna do stupid artific. I'm gonna throw out

556
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
(Justin Hale)
the um the cannon and I am
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ahead.

557
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
What
-

(Justin Hale)
going to use the cannon's force ballista to

558
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
(Justin Hale)
propel me up the wall of water. I'm I'm going to go into the water and then use

559
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
(Justin Hale)
it to propel me forward or
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, awesome. Okay, cool.

560
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Uh, let's see. Uh, give me some sort of role for that.

561
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, I'm going to say, what do you think

562
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
(Justin Hale)
upward.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
for that?

563
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
are you talking
-

(Christopher Hooper)
either like a spellcasting role or a

564
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
about?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um or some sort of like uh

565
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
basically the ability to like like how well and

566
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
how effectively are you like aiming this thing to be like

567
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
(Justin Hale)
Do you want it to be int based
-

(Christopher Hooper)
a propulsion device through the

568
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
(Justin Hale)
for like calculation style or
-

(Christopher Hooper)
water. Uh

569
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think that makes sense. Maybe just an arcana check

570
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
(Tyram)
What the
-

(Justin Hale)
what? Okay, I can do

571
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
(Tyram)
heck?
-

(Justin Hale)
that.

572
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
(Justin Hale)
Uh 23. I don't get any pluses

573
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
(Justin Hale)
from anybody with that,

574
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000

(Christopher Hooper)
um actually like start bl

577
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
like blasting your way up towards and past the uh

578
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
(Justin Hale)
8.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
life vest people. Um okay. Uh Ellis, you were asking about

579
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Don't worry about it.

we will assume is uh just

582
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um, people on the boat, um, they are beginning

586
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
to ride their grappling hooks onto, uh,

587
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
(Tyram)
Hold on. Hold

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
(Tyram)
on.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ship itself. And let

(Christopher Hooper)
me What does shatter do? Does shatter

591
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
It's

(Justin Hale)
No,

(Christopher Hooper)
apply

(Christopher Hooper)

(Ellis Taylor)
something tomorrow.

(Christopher Hooper)
um it

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it um lets loose a

611
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
fearsome roar towards the ship and it

612
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
hits like a sound blast and

613
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000

616
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
negligible. Yeah, just
-

(Christopher Hooper)
bad. It could be

617
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
a
-

(Justin Hale)
negligible.

(Christopher Hooper)
negligible. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see what the

(Christopher Hooper)
dice

619
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
problem? I'm not talking about the song. I'm talking about

Toeer, some friend you turned out to be. Don't even trust Justin on this small
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Justin?

-

(Justin Hale)
me.

623
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
(Tyram)
thing.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
here.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. The the dice were like

624
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
You stop fighting each
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Justin is mostly accurate.

625
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um but in in this story we're

626
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
telling uh this blast hits the ship and you

627
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
see pieces of wood. It looks like one of the

628
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
other.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
sailors is just completely eviscerated at the point of

629
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
impact. Um, you all are floating up.

630
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, it's at this point you start hitting the top of the

631
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
wateroop. And uh, all right. Who's acting

632
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
(Tyram)
Are we all like we're at the top of the water
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.

633
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
(Tyram)
now, right? How far away are we from the
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Are we at the top?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
here? That's right. Yep.

634
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
(Tyram)
dragon?
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Huh?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Well, uh, so the dragon

635
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
is probably a 30 40 feet just above the ship

636
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
And how far are we from the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
right

637
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
ship? Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
now. Uh, you're like right beside it. Uh, because you

638
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
(Tyram)
Okay. So, it's like 30 to 40 ft away from
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you followed up. Yeah.

639
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000

-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yes.

640
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
(Tyram)
right. Should we roll initiative at this
-

(Ellis Taylor)
cool.

641
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000

Bob. Um, so let's just pretend I didn't use that lucky point.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
14. All right.

829
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
That was one of my advantages. And I'll just roll one

830
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
more. Oh, wait. Real life dice. Don't make that mistake

831
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
again. Oh, another 17. So

832
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
(Tyram)
true.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
26. So
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, that

833
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
that's another seven dam. Oh, another 12
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is all right.

834
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
(Tyram)
f***
-

(Ellis Taylor)
damage. Yeah. And I'm going
-

(Christopher Hooper)
12. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

835
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
to assume that topple doesn't count because he's really big. So
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Cool.

836
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
(Tyram)
yeah. I mean, there's no rule that says he
-

(Ellis Taylor)
we're good. It can't. Is

837
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
(Tyram)
can't. I mean, he's almost certainly going to make the saves, but I think like it should
-

(Ellis Taylor)
there?

838
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
(Tyram)
theoretically
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.

839
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
(Tyram)
work. Well, is there a size limit on topple? Hold on. Let me
-

(Ellis Taylor)
I mean, you

840
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
(Tyram)
check.

841
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
could. It doesn't say on

842
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
(Tyram)
Yeah, there's no size limit on
-

(Ellis Taylor)
my little description right

843
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
(Tyram)
it. I mean, you have to roll absolute dog
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, go

844
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
(Tyram)
s*** to fail the save,
-

(Ellis Taylor)
here. Yeah. Well, 8 + 3 + 9

845
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
is what he's got to beat.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ahead.

846
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Uh
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Uh, what type of safe?

847
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
a con topple
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um con

848
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
That makes
-

(Ellis Taylor)
con. Yeah. Oh, a d8 d8 DC of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
save.

849
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
(Tyram)
but
-

(Luke Neverisky)
sense.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
eight plus four plus the ability mod

850
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
plus
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

851
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000

Um and what kind of you have a battle axe. Is that

852
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000

993
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
(Tyram)
in. I had it already. Oh, I can do nowhere near 25 damage without sneak

994
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
(Tyram)
attack. Uh, I'm going to use my bonus
-

(Christopher Hooper)
great.

995
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
(Tyram)
action to throw a psychic dagger towards the surface of the water to try to

996
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
(Tyram)
get out of the ocean here real quick. All right,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Cool. Okay,

997
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
(Tyram)
so I need to roll a five or better to actually get up there.

998
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
(Tyram)
Um, I rolled a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool. Thanks.

999
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
(Tyram)
five. All right, so um I teleport up to the surface of

1000
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
(Tyram)
the ocean. Um, I guess I'll think at Olivia, but I think psychic phone is still

1001
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
(Tyram)
going. I am no good in water. Good luck.

1002
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
(Tyram)
Bye. And I'm out. That's my

1003
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
So Olivia is like 50 ft

1004
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
underwater,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Nice. Uh,

1005
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
right? Cool. Just
-

(Christopher Hooper)
yes. Yes, she is.

1006
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
(Tyram)
turn.

1007
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
below

1008
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I'm gonna I'm going to use a different stat block than

1009
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
War for Soldier. Um, okay, great.

1010
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, one of the uh one of

1011
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
the one of the remaining knights, the only remaining knight is going to stab

1012
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
into this dragon as well. Uh,

1013
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
miss and miss. Okay. So, next in the

1014
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
order, uh we have Liliana. So, so

1015
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Silus, you just end up uh you have enough movement

1016
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
(Tyram)
enough for the teleportation. I actually haven't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
to make it to the surface of the water then,

1017
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
(Tyram)
used my move yet. Is there anything around me that I could like swim to

1018
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
(Tyram)
that would be worth swimming to?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
right? Um let's see. How

1019
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
(Tyram)
All of it. I haven't used my move yet. Well,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
much movement do you have left? Okay, then

1020
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
(Tyram)
I Well, um I guess I would have to be like I'd have to roll a swim check,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you're you're close enough to get to the water or

1021
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, I think it's just what

1022
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
like um if you want to I

1023
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
(Tyram)
right?
-

(Ellis Taylor)
No. So
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I feel like you are close enough to the boat. Um if you

1024
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
(Tyram)
Okay. Okay. The worst I could do on
-

(Ellis Taylor)
bad.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
want to if you want to get to the boat otherwise

1025
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
(Tyram)
athletics is a 13, if that makes any difference.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you

1026
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
do. Okay. So,

1027
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um it's basically, uh I think you can get to the

1028
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
boat. Um I think you'd need a 15 or better to

1029
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
(Tyram)
Okay, I'll give it a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
get on board. I'm not saying

1030
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
to help
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that getting on board is a good thing to do, but if you wanted to get on

1031
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
(Tyram)
shot. Uh, I feel like it's at least then I wouldn't
-

(Ellis Taylor)
me. is the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
board Okay,

1032
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
(Tyram)
be like just bobbing in the water. So yeah, I I I want to get some things solid
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool.

1033
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
(Tyram)
under my feet, I think. But if he blows up the boat, you know, egg
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah.

1034
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
(Tyram)
on my face, but
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, man, it'd be really dumb to be caught

1035
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
(Tyram)
yeah. Okay,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
in the water. Um, you'd have to be a real idiot to do that.

1036
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
(Tyram)
I got a 18 on my athletics, so I to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, speaking

1037
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
(Tyram)
uh pull myself up under the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
of All right, awesome. Um, speaking of

1038
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
water. That's me. I'm an idiot in the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
some of the idiots in the water, Liliana, it's your

1039
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
(Tyram)
boat.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
water. Um, so I know

1040
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
um the rules with regards to like leveled spells can't do two the same turn.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
turn.

1041
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
All good. What about if it's a if it's a charge for my mandolin? Does that count

1042
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
as a leveled spell even though it's listed as a

1043
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Oh. Uh, is it is it a leveled

1044
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
spell?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
spell? Like does it have a level a

1045
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
So it's appearing. So for example, I want to cast fly as a part of the mandolin. It appears

1046
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
as a third level spell, but it doesn't say cast. It just has one
-

(Justin Hale)
Yeah, it's a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
level?

1047
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
charge,
-

(Justin Hale)
it's a charge on the item itself.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. And and

1048
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sorry, what was the what was the thing that you're checking against

1049
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
right? So, if I wanted to do that and then cast a leveled spell as a bonus action

1050
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
like a heal or something like that, then
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that? Oh, uh yeah, we have

1051
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um because you're not using a spell slot, the rule we we generally run

1052
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
like
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is you can only use one spell slot. So, yeah, you can totally do

1053
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
awesome. Then I'll cast flying myself. Uh well
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that.

1054
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
actually I am what 50 ft to the

1055
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, you're you're on the

1056
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
surface surface. Okay, great. In that case I'm going to cast
-

(Christopher Hooper)
surface of the water.

1057
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
fly. Um and then I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Okay,

1058
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)

1059
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I'll I'll do that. Um, let me cast fly

1060
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
and I'm going to get out of the water and just
-

(Christopher Hooper)

01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
(Tyram)
God.
-

(Justin Hale)
instead.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
go ahead and give me another um

1077
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
here.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Why? I'm just floating in water,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh strength saving throw

1078
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
right? No,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
here. You're trying to hold on to the dragon,

1079
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I was sitting on Bob and essentially Silus was holding Bob to the

1080
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
dragon. And now that Silus is
-

(Christopher Hooper)
right?

1081
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
(Tyram)
I feel like Bob
-

(Ellis Taylor)
gone.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. What you Okay, but are you trying to hold on to the dragon or

1082
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
No, no, no. I mean, I was holding on to Bob this whole
-

(Christopher Hooper)
no?

1083
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
(Tyram)
like Well, I feel like Bob It's not completely hopeless that Bob stays
-

(Ellis Taylor)
time. The only reason I stayed on the

1084
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
(Tyram)
on the
-

(Ellis Taylor)
dragon.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Okay. So, I kind of treat you and Bob as the same thing.

1085
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
(Tyram)
dragon.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So, um

1086
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah, I'm gonna go with no. If I knew he's going deep, like no, I'm not staying on. We're

1087
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
We're jumping ship, too.
-

(Justin Hale)
physics
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

1088
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
(Justin Hale)
question. If the rate at which the dragon is sinking is
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Mhm.

1089
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
(Justin Hale)
rapid, would that then create suction on the top of the dragon,

1090
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
(Justin Hale)
thus causing downforce on Bob to keep him going down

1091
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
teacher. Do we have homework?
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah. Oh
-

(Justin Hale)
with the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, actually, no, because

1092
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
no.
-

(Justin Hale)
dragon? Damn it. Magic every
-

(Christopher Hooper)
of

1093
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
magic. Yeah, but it's also why

1094
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
they don't die from barometric pressure.

1095
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
(Tyram)
God damn. So, we can't use the Godzilla minus one
-

(Justin Hale)
time. Fair.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So from

1096
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
(Tyram)
method to try to blow up this

1097
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
(Tyram)
dragon.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
bids um only if you plan for it

1098
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh like a session ahead of time and it become it's like a

1099
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
truly rot plan. Um, okay.

1100
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
(Tyram)
That was a good movie. But that is exactly how that scene played out.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um,

1101
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Hallelujah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
but um, okay,

1102
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
No,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Olivia, you are not you're saying you're not trying to stay on the dragon

1103
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
she would have abandoned ship with with

1104
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
(Tyram)
Yes.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
then. Okay. Uh, then you don't see

1105
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Silus. I'm not going down an extra
-

(Christopher Hooper)
this. Uh, okay. Cool.

1106
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
100 feet like can't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
And

1107
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
be. Actually, quick question. What's the movement in water?

1108
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Is it slowed or just your same

1109
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Is it a half?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Cool.

1110
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
What's half? Maybe
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I think it's

1111
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
movement? I tried googling it real quick and it was
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I I think it's half

1112
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
(Justin Hale)
Water is considered rough terrain, right? So we

1113
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
not.

1114
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
unclear.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um I believe so just going to check real

1115
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
quick. Yes, half that's right. Unless you have an

1116
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
explicit move the swim ski. Okay, cool.

1117
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
(Justin Hale)
have
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um,

1118
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
okay. So, we'll say that Silas um

1119
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
dragged you down with him. Um, the like 50 ft

1120
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
below the water. Um, that's where you are right now.

1121
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
(Justin Hale)
I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, you feel this whoosh. What,

1122
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
(Justin Hale)
said you can say it, but does it
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Justin?

1123
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, I don't know, but you could say it.

1124
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Uh you feel this like whoosh of water go by you.

1125
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um and

1126
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
(Justin Hale)
happen?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh and the boat um you hear

1127
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
this like loud under the

1128
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
boat. Uh and then we'll go to

1129
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Elizabeth.

1130
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
Cool. So I heard So she heard the

1131
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
boat. Do I see something happen to the

1132
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
boat? Yeah, I'm just looking at the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, you're in the water,

1133
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right? You see the boat just kind of like almost lift a

1134
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
boat.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
bit and then just like you hear

1135
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
That's probably not good.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
this and then it comes back

1136
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
(Tyram)
So, I'm on the boat. Do I like
-

(Ali Leonard)
Just kind of like
-

(Christopher Hooper)
down.

1137
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
(Tyram)
feel the boat move underneath me or
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah, for

1138
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
(Tyram)
anything? Don't love
-

(Christopher Hooper)
sure. And you feel like this like impact under

1139
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
(Tyram)
that. Not a

1140
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
(Tyram)
fan. Not a fan of these.
-

(Ali Leonard)
woodwise

1141
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
cool. Um

1142
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
Okay. But that's really all I see, right? Just kind of boat and nothing else. Just

1143
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
ocean. I saw a dragon in
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it. The water. You did see it. You did

1144
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
(Ali Leonard)
it at one point. Yeah. And now it's gone.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
see a dragon dive into the

1145
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
So, um I guess I'd go try and get
-

(Christopher Hooper)
water. Yeah. Yeah.

1146
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
on the boat. I don't feel
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1147
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
safe, but I feel

1148
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
like what else is there to do

1149
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
except except everybody's trying
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Yeah. It seems like everybody's getting on the boat.

1150
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
to get on the f****** boat, so it's like kind of the cool kid thing to do, you know? And I'm always kind of about that
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So like

1151
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
(Justin Hale)
Silus keeps
-

(Ali Leonard)
life.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1152
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
(Justin Hale)
screaming I'm on a boat for some
-

(Ali Leonard)
Um, for some reason, it's not that and he's doing kind of

1153
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
like the Rose and Jack pose and I'm like, you're alone. What are you
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Don't you ever

1154
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
(Ali Leonard)
doing? How? So, this is
-

(Christopher Hooper)
forget.

1155
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
(Justin Hale)
reason.
-

(Ali Leonard)
a big boat though. Theoretically, if I wanted to go under the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1156
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Okay. You

1157
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
boat, I have two
-

(Christopher Hooper)
could especially depending on your cons

1158
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
a plus two. What if I took a really
-

(Christopher Hooper)
score.

1159
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
(Ali Leonard)
big
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Okay.

1160
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
breath? And I kind of just wanted to check out the damage under

1161
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
the boat.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1162
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah, I would love to do
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. You want to give me an

1163
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
(Justin Hale)
Hey, while you're doing that, Silus, are we all
-

(Christopher Hooper)
athletics? Okay.

1164
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
(Tyram)
Yeah, we should
-

(Justin Hale)
telepathically linked still or no? Okay,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Great.

1165
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
that. It's a plus one. So, it is a

1166
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
(Justin Hale)
good.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Great. Uh, give me an

1167
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
(Tyram)
be
-

(Ali Leonard)
17. Yeah. Even

1168
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
(Justin Hale)
She'll give you an investigation. You won't even be ready for
-

(Ali Leonard)
better.

1169
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Nice.
-

(Justin Hale)
it. Told you. Told you you
-

(Ali Leonard)
23. What about them
-

(Christopher Hooper)
investigation. 23

1170
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
(Tyram)
We'll accept your
-

(Justin Hale)
weren't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
23. Okay.

1171
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
(Tyram)
surrender now.
-

(Ali Leonard)
apples?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You you go under this boat

1172
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
(Justin Hale)
ready.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
and you see the boat in this battle

1173
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
Mhm.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
map is not accurate because

1174
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
(Tyram)
To
-

(Ali Leonard)
Sure.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
remember 1950s era.

1175
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
Right.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You see under the boat, it has a steel uh

1176
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
underbelly. Um and it has

1177
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
a a few remember you motortored out here. This

1178
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
It's a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is a motorboat. There's some motors under there.

1179
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, but right in the middle of that steel

1180
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
under underbelly, there's like a dent from something

1181
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
motorboat.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh big. Um, but it's holding. It looks like

1182
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it's holding. It looks like the engines are okay. They're not on

1183
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right now. Don't know whose that problem

1184
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
is. Um, and you

1185
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
see a bunch of bubbles. You see a bunch of

1186
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
kind of down.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
bubbles. Yeah. Down and like

1187
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah, sure. Okay. Well, I'll tell everybody there's no hole
-

(Christopher Hooper)
around.

1188
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
yet, but I don't think you can take much more of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Okay.

1189
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
(Ali Leonard)
that.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Great. Um,

1190
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
good, good, good, good, good. Uh, okay.

1191
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Good. Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So Ally, I really like

1192
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that. So it really makes me sad.

1193
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
sure.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, never mind. Nothing happens to

1194
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
Uhhuh. Well, now I'm going
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you. Nothing. Don't worry about

1195
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
(Tyram)
But he told you not
-

(Ali Leonard)
to worry about it. I know, but now I'm going

1196
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, you have explicit instructions not to worry
-

(Ali Leonard)
to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it.

1197
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
about
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, I think you could do a smidge more if you were so inspired.

1198
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Otherwise, we'll move to

1199
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
(Tyram)
to.
-

(Justin Hale)
What you going to
-

(Ali Leonard)
Um I don't really
-

(Christopher Hooper)
brew with all

1200
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
(Justin Hale)
do?
-

(Ali Leonard)
have
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that

1201
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
inappropriate that was
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ass. Oh,

1202
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
inappropriate. I'm assuming that was of the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
sorry.

1203
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
people that would have up in brew that said that in the in the group you

1204
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I think I think you're hearing like the screams of people

1205
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
had. What are you gonna do with all that
-

(Christopher Hooper)
on board and they're like going

1206
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
(Tyram)
Do you George
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Oops.
-

(Ali Leonard)
ass? Sure. Sure. Sure.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
crazy.

1207
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
(Tyram)
Knights think of anything

1208
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
(Tyram)
else?
-

(Ali Leonard)
Sure. And then I'm actually

1209
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
gonna Misty's step. Can I mist step
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1210
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
(Justin Hale)
Jesus.
-

(Ali Leonard)
up to on top of the box?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Normally, you need to see

1211
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
I need to be able to see. I know. I kept thinking it's like I need to be able
-

(Christopher Hooper)
where you're

1212
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
(Tyram)
Can I visualize the the
-

(Ali Leonard)
to know what it looks like for me in my

1213
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
(Tyram)
landing spot and like relate it to it
-

(Christopher Hooper)
missing. Um,

1214
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
(Tyram)
psychically?
-

(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Ali Leonard)
brain. I'm gonna splinch
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I'm going to say for my own sake, no.

1215
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, okay. But you can you can probably get back up to the

1216
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
myself. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll make my way downtown.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
surface. All right.

1217
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Cool. All that in your

1218
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
(Justin Hale)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
jeans, Brew, you're

1219
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
(Justin Hale)
So, can I use Well, first of all, I'm

1220
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
(Justin Hale)
still in the water. Can I Can I see the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
up.

1221
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
(Justin Hale)
dragon? And then I can't see the dragon
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. No, you can see a

1222
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
(Justin Hale)
anymore. Damn
-

(Ali Leonard)
I told you about those
-

(Christopher Hooper)
bunch of bubbles, but you don't see the

1223
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
(Justin Hale)
it. Okay. Um, so that trick's not going to
-

(Ali Leonard)
bubbles.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dragon.

1224
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
(Justin Hale)
work. While I'm still in the water, can I use the momentum of my
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

1225
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
(Justin Hale)
cannon to to catapult me onto the

1226
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
That's the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Give me an art

1227
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
advantage to doing it. The disadvantage is you don't

1228
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
(Justin Hale)
boat? Yeah.

1229
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
(Justin Hale)
18. Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
check. 18.

1230
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
(Ali Leonard)
have
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Wow. Um, okay. Yeah,

1231
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you like propel yourself out of the water

1232
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and as you're like getting out of the water and getting up

1233
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
like it's kind of it loses

1234
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
(Ali Leonard)
sliding
-

(Christopher Hooper)
its you're now fighting against gravity a lot more than you were

1235
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
before. Um and uh but you are able

1236
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
to make just the ledge. You grab on you pull yourself on and you're right at the ledge

1237
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
(Tyram)
Oh my
-

(Justin Hale)
Sure. Okay. Um,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
of the boat.

1238
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
(Tyram)
god.
-

(Justin Hale)
in in everyone else's head, I I think that's how this work, right? We can talk

1239
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
(Justin Hale)
to everybody, not

1240
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
(Justin Hale)
just uh the dragon's totally gonna come back and and go through

1241
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
(Justin Hale)
the bottom of this boat. We got to get out of

1242
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
here.
-

(Ali Leonard)
sign of in that number one

1243
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
(Justin Hale)
Oh,
-

(Ali Leonard)
guitar back there.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Sorry, I'm going to mute you, Ally,

1244
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
(Justin Hale)
actually, I was going to do this to the dragon. Can I do
-

(Christopher Hooper)
again.

1245
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
(Justin Hale)
it to the boat instead?

1246
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yes.
-

(Justin Hale)
Is the both considered
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Uh, set it on

1247
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
(Justin Hale)
an
-

(Christopher Hooper)
fire. Um,

1248
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
(Justin Hale)
object? Um, enlarge
-

(Christopher Hooper)
what are you what are you trying to

1249
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Answer.

1250
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
do?

1251
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
(Justin Hale)
slashred. Uh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, what level spell is it?

1252
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
(Justin Hale)
level two.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Level two. Uh,

1253
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
(Justin Hale)
I was going to make the boat bigger
-

(Christopher Hooper)
which which way are you going? You going bigger or

1254
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
(Justin Hale)
because it increases its

1255
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
smaller? Okay. Um,

1256
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
yeah, you could do that.

1257
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
(Justin Hale)
strength or should I make it smaller so
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, yeah, you could do

1258
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
(Justin Hale)
we can get the hell out of here
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that.

1259
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I think the dragon will probably be able to
-

(Justin Hale)
faster?

1260
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
(Tyram)
Is the boat even capable of moving right now? Has we wrecked
-

(Luke Neverisky)
find us if it's still

1261
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
small. That's a good
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, so what you got from Ellsworth

1262
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
(Tyram)
that?
-

(Luke Neverisky)
point.
-

(Justin Hale)
I thought

1263
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
(Justin Hale)
she said the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
was was she's gonna unmute herself in a

1264
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
(Justin Hale)
fine.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
second. She's not going to mute herself.

1265
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
(Justin Hale)
Nope.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Paints were fine when I saw them below
-

(Christopher Hooper)
She's going to

1266
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
the boat, but they're not on for some reason.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
say the engines are fine.

1267
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
(Justin Hale)
Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
That's right. No one has turned them

1268
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
(Justin Hale)
okay. Did you say that to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
on. I

1269
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
(Justin Hale)
us? No, no, no. Did Elizabeth say that to the rest of us? Like, do we know

1270
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
(Justin Hale)
that? Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
did. It was inferred through psychic

1271
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
(Justin Hale)
I heard the the boat was fine part. I didn't hear that the engines were off.

1272
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
(Justin Hale)
Okay. Um, looking at the boat
-

(Christopher Hooper)
phone.

1273
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
(Justin Hale)
and the people that are on it, if I'm to make it smaller, would

1274
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
(Justin Hale)
everyone still be able to fit on
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Uh, how much

1275
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
(Justin Hale)
it? It makes it one size smaller.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
smaller?

1276
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
(Justin Hale)
Okay. Do I want to do

1277
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
(Justin Hale)
that?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Making smaller. If we're including the boat, that will

1278
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
include the engines, by the

1279
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
(Justin Hale)
Yeah. No. Um, no. I want to make it

1280
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
(Justin Hale)
bigger. Reducing seems to make everything worse. I'm going to make it
-

(Christopher Hooper)
way.

1281
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
(Justin Hale)
bigger. Ah,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. A damn.

1282
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
(Tyram)
unless
-

(Justin Hale)
I made the right

1283
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
(Tyram)
he's playing games with
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. All right.

1284
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
(Justin Hale)
choice. Yes.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You're gonna make it bigger.

1285
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Um, you you cast your

1286
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
enlarge spell and you see the board everything just

1287
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
stretching.

1288
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, which is great because I would hate to make the

1289
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sounds of uh all the

1290
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sailors under underboard getting

1291
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
crushed.

1292
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay. So, I make it bigger that

1293
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
(Tyram)
Wow.
-

(Justin Hale)
uh it has advantage on the strength checks and saving

1294
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
(Justin Hale)
throws if the dragon so chooses. Um,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Awesome.

1295
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yes.
-

(Justin Hale)
and then I'm going to run down and see if I can get the engine running. Or

1296
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
(Justin Hale)
I'm going to I guess I'm going to run that direction since we're in initiative

1297
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
(Tyram)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. All right. Okay. You uh you head below decks

1298
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um and you start looking for the engine room. Um,

1299
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
cool. We'll go to Olivia, who we're gonna skip her

1300
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
That's I'm going to use Bob's
-

(Justin Hale)
order.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
because she is doing

1301
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
60 foot movement and just dash and get to the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
something. Okay,

1302
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
cool. Get to the surface. You have enough to get on the

1303
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
surface.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
boat.

1304
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Cool.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um,

1305
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
dragon.

1306
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, it's at this point.

1307
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Well, let me let me roll something

1308
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
first. Okay. Okay, cool. And then we'll roll something

1309
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
(Justin Hale)
Why don't you uh why don't you roll something
-

(Christopher Hooper)
else.

1310
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Okay.

1311
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, I I'll

1312
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
(Justin Hale)
first?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I'll ask I'll ask you all this.

1313
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, would you rather the dragon attack people or attack

1314
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
(Justin Hale)
I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
the

1315
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
(Justin Hale)
assumed just me that it was going to attack

1316
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I think I prefer the
-

(Justin Hale)
the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
boat? You

1317
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
(Tyram)
We are stranded. here for a little while. I'm actually kind of interested in
-

(Christopher Hooper)
prefer the

1318
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
(Tyram)
going back down and talking to Luna anyway, so I wouldn't be that upset about
-

(Christopher Hooper)
boat.

1319
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
boat. Yeah. Take the
-

(Justin Hale)

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

1321
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um. All right. So,

1322
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh, Brew, as you're getting closer to the engines,

1323
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
(Tyram)
it.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um, it seems like it

1324
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
is you hear, uh, you

1325
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
hear something outside the engine room.

1326
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and uh let's

1327
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000

1328
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000

Uh, it's not terrible. Little little lost,

1329
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
but the internet

(Christopher Hooper)

1330
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
(Justin Hale)

(Christopher Hooper)
Uh, it sounds like something is tearing

1331
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
at um around the engines

1332
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
(Justin Hale)
Oh, well that doesn't
-

(Christopher Hooper)

(Christopher Hooper)

(Christopher Hooper)
turn. It's bone knight

1336
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
(Tyram)
I thought I was before the
-

(Luke Neverisky)
There's blood
-

(Justin Hale)
Rude.

1337
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
(Tyram)
night.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
turn. No, you are after

1338
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
lantern.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
most of the

1339
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
knights. All right.

1340
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Uh there's still a night stuck on this little buddy,

1341
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
but you don't know that. Um, and the rest of

1342
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
the knights are shooting down into the

1343
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
water. Um, missing terribly. All right, Silus, you're

1344
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
(Tyram)
Um, am I

1345
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
(Tyram)
aware that the like he that there's something over near the

1346
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
up. Give me perception check.

1347
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
(Tyram)
engines?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, actually with Brew uh in psychic phone, I think

1348
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
(Tyram)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you know. Yes.

1349
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
(Tyram)
Um, okay. So, I

1350
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
(Tyram)
go over near the um the

1351
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
(Tyram)
engines. I have blind sense out to 10

1352
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
(Tyram)
ft. Does that mean that I can attack this dragon

1353
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
(Tyram)
even though I can't see it and still not suffer from a

1354
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
(Tyram)
disadvantage?

1355
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Uh you you don't have like

1356
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um it's between the boats between you,

1357
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
(Tyram)
I'm saying I'm like running over to the edge of the boat where the engines

1358
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right? Um let's

1359
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
see. Um, I'm going to say you can attack with

1360
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
(Tyram)
are. Even though not theoretically not being able to see it shouldn't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
disadvantage

1361
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
(Tyram)
make any difference for
-

(Christopher Hooper)
here. It's not even about whether you can see

1362
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it. It's about leaning over the side and like

1363
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
attacking it like while trying to get it an

1364
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
(Tyram)
me. Oh, I'm just going to jump over the railings and straight
-

(Christopher Hooper)
angle off the side of the

1365
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
(Tyram)
down if that that's what I need to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
boat. Okay. Yeah.

1366
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
(Tyram)
do. Um, I'm trying
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Uh, so you jump into the

1367
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
(Tyram)
I'm picturing this as like I jump over the railings and attack while I'm still in

1368
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
(Tyram)
midair, you know? All cool
-

(Christopher Hooper)
water. Nice. All right.

1369
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
(Tyram)
like. All right. Um, so still
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah. Go

1370
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
(Tyram)
disadvantage stick. All
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ahead. No, with that. No, that's

1371
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
(Tyram)
right. So, I'm going to throw the first dagger. I don't think I have advantage, so we'll
-

(Christopher Hooper)
fine.

1372
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
(Tyram)
just see if I can hit it. Uh, 20. Sorry,

1373
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
(Tyram)
22. All right, no sneak attack, but
-

(Christopher Hooper)
It

1374
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
(Tyram)
I still get to do uh damn it. Uh just six

1375
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
hits. Uh, six damage.

1376
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000

1377
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000

(Christopher Hooper)
That's the

1381
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
(Tyram)
one. Getting my

1382
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000

1425
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
to Oh,

01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
man. All right. I'm going to risk it for a biscuit

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

1429
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. All right. What's the DC

1430
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Wisdom
-

(Christopher Hooper)
here? Wisdom 17.

1431
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Huh?

1432
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, it

1433
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
17.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
uh it seems like you you cast

1434
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yes.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it and it starts to to form and you see it

1435
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
should have
-

(Christopher Hooper)
let out a

1436
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
(Tyram)
I mean, hey, making it
-

(Luke Neverisky)
known. All
-

(Christopher Hooper)
using one of its legendary

1437
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
(Tyram)
burn those is not a bad
-

(Luke Neverisky)
right. That's true.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
resistances.

1438
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
(Tyram)
thing.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Um All right. Um so

1439
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
question. If I'm concentrating on fly and I cast polymorphis concentration, do I

1440
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
break concentration even though it was successful for a second?

1441
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I think so.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.
-

1443
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I don't want like I would like to keep flying but I realize polymorph is a concentration spell and so I'm

1444
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
guessing the fact that I even
-

(Christopher Hooper)

(Christopher Hooper)
okay. No.

1448
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000

-

(Christopher Hooper)
No.

01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
If I miss a step though,

01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
right.

(Ali Leonard)
I can't do another spell. So that's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
action. That's

1532
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
(Tyram)
lay on hand is not a
-

(Ellis Taylor)
But you could do
-

(Ali Leonard)
bad.

1533
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
(Tyram)
spell. If you wanted to do
-

(Ellis Taylor)

1534
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
action.
-

(Ali Leonard)
her, right? So I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
could Okay, this is

1535
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
will.

1536
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
What? What is interesting? Me laying on hands.

1537
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
interesting. Uh oh. Can you could use shove, but it's

1538
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
I'm not gonna shovel
-

(Christopher Hooper)
only 5 ft. Never

1539
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
and I need you to know
-

(Christopher Hooper)
mind. But you can actually pull them towards you. You can actually shove

1540
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
that. Um I don't think that's helpful. So I'll
-

(Christopher Hooper)
towards you, which is interesting. It's only

1541
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
miss you step and then I'll lay on hands. So then
-

(Christopher Hooper)
five feet.

1542
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
you're
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So,

1543
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
That's better
-

(Ali Leonard)
up only by 10 though.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
okay. Now, I I

1544
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I think that you all think I'm a mean DM, but would a mean

1545
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
DM let us bend the rules by allowing you to

1546
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
I thought messy stuff
-

(Christopher Hooper)
misty step and lay on hands in the same turn? I think

1547
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
(Tyram)
That's completely legal. It wouldn't require you to bend the rules at
-

(Ali Leonard)
is or lands isn't a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
not.

1548
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Technically, technically Misty Step is can only be cast as a bonus

1549
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
(Tyram)
all. You can always tag in a bonus action for your action. That's You can
-

(Christopher Hooper)
action. So, it's technically

1550
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
(Tyram)
always download
-

(Ali Leonard)
spell.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
technically you technically you cannot, but because I am

1551
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
(Tyram)
it.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
He's a generous
-

(Ali Leonard)
Thank you,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
a nice DM, I say you can

1552
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
(Tyram)
Wait, why were you misspecting? Were you not
-

(Ali Leonard)
generous DM. Thank
-

(Christopher Hooper)
because I am very generous.

1553
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
(Tyram)
like already on the deck there?
-

(Luke Neverisky)
guy.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. She had
-

(Ali Leonard)
you. I wasn't on the deck.

1554
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
to get onto the
-

(Ali Leonard)
I had to get on the boat and

1555
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
(Tyram)
Okay.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
boat.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, cuz I know y'all want to paint me as a bad

1556
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
move.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
guy, but clearly I allow you to do two bonus

1557
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I mean, does she have can did she have to dash to get on the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
actions uh in the same turn,

1558
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
boat?
-

(Ali Leonard)
I had to get on the boat,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
which

1559
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
which is an which is a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
no, she had to get on she just had to use her movement to get on the boat.

1560
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
But technically in the rules, you cannot use two bonus

1561
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
actions even if one is in place of your action, which is real

1562
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
So
-

(Christopher Hooper)
stupid. Um, I'm just saying that

1563
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
(Ali Leonard)
movement.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
because a lot of people like to point fingers and I think we

1564
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
should all just say that I'm very kind.

1565
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
H. Okay, Toeer.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, but that is your full turn and Brew is

1566
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
Sorry.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
unconscious and I would like you to make a death saving

1567
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
throw. For you see,

1568
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I'm kind.
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay, that's a

1569
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
First of all, how dare you
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, that is a

1570
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Does does my order of devotion extend to saving
-

(Justin Hale)
seven.

1571
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
throws to death saving throws or or

1572
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I just
-

(Ellis Taylor)
protection or is it just checks? I need to look at
-

(Christopher Hooper)
failure. Um,

1573
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I don't know.

1574
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
that. No,

1575
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
wait. That's features and traits. Wrong

1576
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
think
-

(Christopher Hooper)
of protection. I don't even see

1577
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
place.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it in your actions, but it's a feature. It's

1578
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
It just says plus three to saving
-

(Christopher Hooper)
probably

1579
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
passive. Okay. Well, that's the

1580
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
model
-

(Christopher Hooper)
answer.
-

(Justin Hale)
What was the

1581
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
throws. That's not helpful. Does
-

(Christopher Hooper)
A uh
-

(Justin Hale)
answer? All right.

1582
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
it include death saving throws?
-

(Ali Leonard)
tonight. Just got out. our most
-

(Christopher Hooper)
oh, it's

1583
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
death saving throws.

1584
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
recent wall.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Sure. Yeah, it includes death saving

1585
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
He couldn't go to the right
-

(Christopher Hooper)
throws. That sounds
-

(Justin Hale)
So that puts me at

1586
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
(Tyram)
If it puts you at 10, that's a success.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Nice.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
You get a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
fun.
-

(Justin Hale)
what? Okay, I'll take

1587
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Wow, that's that's clutch right

1588
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
there. Um, great. Good
-

(Justin Hale)
it.

1589
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
three. Yay.
-

(Ali Leonard)
anymore. Go ahead. Check between a couple young
-

(Christopher Hooper)
job.

1590
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
drivers.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, you hear you hear

1591
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um more banging downstairs. Bang bang

1592
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
(Tyram)
If those nights are f****** when we need them to f****** pitch

1593
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
(Tyram)
in,
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Start. Is it night time?

1594
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
(Tyram)
so
-

(Luke Neverisky)
determinate. Okay, now
-

(Christopher Hooper)
bang. Um, no, it's

1595
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
(Tyram)
I mean even like generally speaking already, I am
-

(Christopher Hooper)
afternoon. Yeah.

1596
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
(Tyram)
super disappointed in these dragon killing experts. I don't think they've done a single point

1597
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
(Tyram)
of damage so
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh yeah, they have. They've done

1598
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,000
(Tyram)
far. Oh, wow. Okay, never

1599
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
(Tyram)
mind. What would these assholes do if we weren't here? They'd be
-

(Christopher Hooper)
eight,

1600
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
(Tyram)
f****** dead by
-

(Luke Neverisky)
f****** you're f******
-

(Christopher Hooper)
but they haven't been hurt at

1601
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
(Tyram)
now. Who cares? They're
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Man, where's their freaking
-

(Christopher Hooper)
all. They're doing fine. Y all the ones

1602
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
(Tyram)
contributing
-

(Ellis Taylor)
leader?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dying. All right,

1603
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
(Tyram)
s***.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Um Olivia is
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Olivia, you're

1604
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
going to cast aid um at third

1605
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
level on Liliana and Brew and you guys get 10 hit

1606
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
up. Uh what's the what's uh about aid? Do
-

(Justin Hale)
Come back

1607
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
points. It just says 30
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you need to be in sight, in range, and
-

(Justin Hale)
up.

1608
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
feet. Doesn't need to be touching it. 30 feet in range. And I don't need to see them. It doesn't say anything
-

(Christopher Hooper)
touching?

1609
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
about seeing. Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Hell yeah. Wow.

1610
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Paladins are crazy. They're crazy

1611
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
(Tyram)
Yeah, I'd say
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Wow. Is that 10
-

(Ellis Taylor)
So that's uh
-

(Christopher Hooper)
good. Probably the best

1612
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
HP?
-

(Ellis Taylor)
it is it says

1613
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
targets uh hit point maximum and current hit points increase

1614
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
by 10.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
class. Oh my

1615
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
(Tyram)
so.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
So you're
-

(Christopher Hooper)
god. Okay, cool.

1616
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Thank you.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
welcome.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Ridiculous.
-

(Justin Hale)
My maximum

1617
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
(Tyram)
Your maximum is 10 points higher. This is an
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Ridiculous.
-

(Justin Hale)
is 10 higher right

1618
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
(Tyram)
excellent spell to cast uh like at the start of your adventuring day because
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yep.

1619
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
(Tyram)
I think it lasts for like eight
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yes, I should. Yes, we need to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yep. But

1620
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
remember to do that.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it's even better to save your
-

(Justin Hale)
now.

1621
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,000
(Tyram)
hours.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah. Yes. As a DM.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yes. And

1622
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
friend.

1623
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
then and then I'm going to

1624
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
that's my action. So and I don't know where the dragon

1625
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
(Tyram)
The the
-

(Luke Neverisky)
I
-

(Ellis Taylor)
is. So I am just going to cast. He's right over the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, you have a pretty good idea where it

1626
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
(Tyram)
the dragon is not being subtle right now. It is currently pitting me against the
-

(Ellis Taylor)
edge. Oh, okay. He's just

1627
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
(Tyram)
f******
-

(Ellis Taylor)
over I think it's Ellis trying to balance baby.

1628
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
(Tyram)
boat.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Um, I'm just going to use my bonus
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is.

1629
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
action to cast on my magic on my weapon and make it

1630
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
magical. So, I get a plus two whenever I actually go attack

1631
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
it because I am move closer to

1632
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
okay.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
it. So, I'm ready to attack. Where am I,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Okay.

1633
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Olivia? Next time

1634
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
around.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. What magic weapon is what you're casting? Is that what it

1635
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. Yes.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is? Yes. Okay.

1636
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
So, basically, I just have a plus two. I'm getting
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Isn't Isn't your weapon already

1637
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
a plus two on top of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
magical?

1638
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
it. Oh, non-magical
-

(Christopher Hooper)
The spell says non-magical

1639
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
(Tyram)
Oh, it's a mid point. Those are both spell
-

(Ellis Taylor)
weapon. Maybe. I don't

1640
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh,
-

(Ellis Taylor)
know. Wait, say that
-

(Christopher Hooper)
weapon.

1641
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
(Tyram)
slots. You can't cast it regardless. It's a a second spell slot.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
right.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
again.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1642
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
(Tyram)
You've already used the spell slot this turn.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Oh, that's right. Well, I thought it was a bon

1643
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
(Tyram)
bonus action and action is
-

(Ellis Taylor)
it was a bonus action, which is why I was doing it, but I guess you can't do two of

1644
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
(Tyram)
irrelevant when it comes to spell slot
-

(Ellis Taylor)
those. Never
-

(Christopher Hooper)
and

1645
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
(Tyram)
usage. Oh, but if you
-

(Ellis Taylor)
mind.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
doubly because it's already a magical

1646
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
(Tyram)
wanted to do lay on hands of some or on yourself or someone else, then that's not a
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. Yeah,

1647
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
(Tyram)
spell. So, you could do that if you wanted
-

(Ellis Taylor)
I'll I'll lay I'll lay hands on

1648
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
(Tyram)
to.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
myself. Try to find

1649
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
the image. I'll heal myself for
-

(Christopher Hooper)
weapon. Nice.

1650
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Cool, cool, cool,

1651
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
(Tyram)
You be great, Ally. You got your head out of the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool,

1652
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
cool. Wait, why does that why does Brew have 20 hit points

1653
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
(Tyram)
gutter because f*** you.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
now? I think you double I think you double
-

(Justin Hale)
What?

1654
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
(Tyram)
That's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
20
-

(Christopher Hooper)
added
-

(Justin Hale)
Oh. Uh, I think the max HP may

1655
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
(Justin Hale)
have done it. There we go.

1656
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
10. Okay, good.
-

(Justin Hale)
I fixed it.

1657
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, that sounds great. Thank you, Olivia. It is dragon.

1658
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
It is dragon turn.

1659
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, dragon will

1660
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um dragon will see if they

1661
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yay!
-

(Christopher Hooper)
get lightning

1662
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)

1669
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
(Ali Leonard)
Rude. You're below deck, aren't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
brutal. I

a dexterity saving throw, but I'm going to give you

1676
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
advantage because aiming is

(Christopher Hooper)
hard through objects. So, go ahead

(Ellis Taylor)
As long as you guys are within 10 ft of me, then
-

(Ali Leonard)
remembering. Uh, let me
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, so

1685
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
(Tyram)
here?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
now, so it's Olivia, Brew, Liliana, and

1686
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Elizabeth.
-

(Justin Hale)
what?

1687
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
(Justin Hale)
Um, it's a 23 save for

1688
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
yes.
-

(Ali Leonard)
see.
-

(Justin Hale)
me.

1689
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
(Justin Hale)
You know, like I made the ship bigger so it's like super strong now,

1690
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

(Justin Hale)

(Justin Hale)
not skipping leg

(Christopher Hooper)
That Yeah, that's so true. That is so
-

(Justin Hale)
day.

1693
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
true.
-

(Justin Hale)
So like I think the boat's a little offended that the dragon's able to attack

1694
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
(Justin Hale)
through it.

1695
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Never.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, so who whoever failed gets the full

1696
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
49 lightning

1697
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
What was the

1698
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
DC?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
damage uh 19, but you can roll with

1699
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay.
-

(Ali Leonard)
over
-

(Christopher Hooper)
advantage. And if you made the save, it's half

1700
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
there.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
for 24.

1701
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
(Justin Hale)
What's the

1702
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I think he
-

(Justin Hale)

1703
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
does. Are you down again? Are you Are

02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Wait.

(Christopher Hooper)
boat and driving their

1726
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
swords into this thing, stabbing

1727
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
away. Silus, you're doing

1728
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000

(Tyram)
Okay. I'm like pinned up against the uh the side of the boat,

1730
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,000
(Tyram)
right? But I'm like up against the side of the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
turn. You're not pinned. You were just slammed against the side of the boat.

1731
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
(Tyram)
boat, right? I turn around and I just walk up the side of the boat since I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So, yeah.

1732
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,000
(Tyram)
can spider climb. Um, and
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1733
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
(Tyram)
then like hanging sideways, I'm going to try to pelt him with my daggers

1734
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Okay. So, you're

1735
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
(Tyram)
again. And yeah, I can just use my normal move action just to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Gotcha. Cool. Go ahead.

1736
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
(Tyram)
walk up the boat sideways. And I vexed him last time,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1737
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
(Tyram)
so I still have
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yep. And you have uh

1738
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
if you consider uh the St. George

1739
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
(Tyram)
advantage. That's true. So, I definitely
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Knights as allies, they are all over that

1740
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
(Tyram)
have a sneak attack no matter

1741
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,000
(Tyram)
what. I do hit, but damn, I was really hoping for a

1742
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,000
(Tyram)
crit. All
-

(Christopher Hooper)
thing.

1743
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,000
(Tyram)
right. Okay.

1744
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
(Tyram)
Okay. Okay.

1745
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,000
(Tyram)
Um, I

1746
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
(Tyram)

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh,

1748
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
nice. Um, yeah, really good attack.

1749
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
(Tyram)
damage. Uh, psychic daggers
-

(Luke Neverisky)
you?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, you're throwing daggers at

1750
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
(Tyram)
here.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
them. You see the dragon like writhing as

1751
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
these um knights are stabbing at it. Uh, and your

1752
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
dagger pierced them right in the neck. Uh, cool.

1753
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
(Tyram)
My second attack is going to come now.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Uh, is that your second attack,

1754
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
(Tyram)
Bonus
-

(Christopher Hooper)
too?

1755
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
(Tyram)
action. Uh,

1756
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
(Tyram)
hit 19. Total 28, right? So, yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

1757
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,000
(Tyram)
Um, but unfortunately it's just the weaker attack this

1758
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
(Tyram)
time. Uh, it's another seven
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

1759
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:20,000
(Tyram)
damage. Okay. And I'm not going to just

1760
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
(Tyram)
like walk along the side of the boat around the corner

1761
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
(Tyram)
to kind of get out of his line of sight
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Cool. Okay,

1762
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
(Tyram)
here.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool.

1763
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
(Tyram)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, okay. In

1764
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
that uh after that you see the

1765
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
dragon turn and

1766
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh and

1767
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
disappear and then you see a rush uh you can

1768
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
tell movement in the water as this as some

1769
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
invisible force is diving deep below the

1770
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
water. Um all right Liliana it's your turn.

1771
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Oh boy. Um, so Bruce

1772
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
towards the I know he's below decks and I'm guessing is that where the

1773
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
stairs are down? Like how do I get down below
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1774
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, there's um there's a hatch. Uh you can just rush down if you

1775
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
decks? Okay. Um, I'm going to

1776
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
rush down there. And if I open the hatch, can

1777
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I see
-

(Christopher Hooper)
want.

1778
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um let's see. Uh I think you can

1779
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Brew?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
use what's your movements 30.

1780
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Um, think so.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um is there any way you can use your b uh bonus

1781
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
action for movement at all or or

1782
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah. Uh, I was going to use bonus for healing. So, if I have to like dash or something, I can do

1783
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
that.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
healing? You can you can dash to make it to to

1784
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Okay. Um like adjacent to

1785
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
him. Oh, it doesn't really
-

(Christopher Hooper)
him. Um within

1786
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
matter within sight. Okay. All right.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
sight

1787
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I

1788
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)

1789
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
actually, how does this work? Inspiration. Okay. So, I have a bonus action. So,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
basically

1790
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I'm going to

1791
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Who else has temp HP? Is it just Well,

1792
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
nobody now, I'm guessing.

1793
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um I don't I don't know of any

1794
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Right. Okay. Right. I think it's just me.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
That was
-

(Christopher Hooper)
source of temp

1795
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Okay. They Yeah.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
me. The whatever I had,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
HP.

1796
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Okay. All right. So, I'm gonna
-

(Ellis Taylor)
right? I guess what he's thinking of.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, that was hit point max.

1797
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
use

1798
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
um I want to think I want to use Mantle of

1799
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Inspiration. I'm just trying to see if I can It is a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1800
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Bic Inspiration die, so I'm guessing that counts as a bonus action. Oh, yeah. It's there.

1801
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Okay. Um All right. B inspiration die roll a

1802
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
d.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

1803
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Nice. All right. every assuming I can see

1804
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
everybody which I know I can see Brew and I know I can see Olivia and Elizabeth and I don't know

1805
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
about
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So they're on different decks.

1806
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Silus, but if I'm opening the hatch and I can see Brew below

1807
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
deck, can
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So So you you had to go below deck. The reason why it

1808
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
took your movement and an action is because you had to go like go to

1809
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Uh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
a hatch below deck and then zig zig through the below decks

1810
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
okay. Okay, that makes sense. Then
-

(Christopher Hooper)
to reach buu in the engine

1811
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I will not Now you're
-

(Ellis Taylor)
That's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
room. Sorry, I got a shortcut

1812
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
good. Um, all right. In that case, Brew is just going to get a pretty high level

1813
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
healing

1814
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
there.

1815
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
word.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Cool. Limit

1816
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
HP
-

(Justin Hale)
Oh,

1817
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
23. Very

1818
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
23. All right. Um

1819
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I think that's it. Hopefully you can like do something this combat, you
-

(Justin Hale)
there. Thank you.

1820
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)

1821
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
know. Yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
That's

1822
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Sorry.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Ellip, it is your turn and it's you're really

1823
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
I don't

1824
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
love that. So, can I still see the bubbles of where he went down or
-

(Justin Hale)
all.

1825
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
can I just assume
-

(Christopher Hooper)
quiet. You are you are on deck. You could poke your

1826
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
head over if you wanted to and give me a perception check if that's what you wanted to do with your

1827
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
he's my other question before I do that
-

(Christopher Hooper)
turn. Mhm.

1828
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
is so there's an engine room. Is there a

1829
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
ste like like the room where you steer and you actually turn

1830
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
on the boat up on top of

1831
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
deck? Like
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, steering is on the other side.

1832
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
a is it like a boat with like a key where you actually turn
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, there's like

1833
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
it on up deck because that's where Okay,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
a Mhm.

1834
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
I want to go
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah.

1835
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
So, you hop into uh what's the the captain's

1836
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
court the the captain's steering room basically

1837
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
at the front of the um uh

1838
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
there.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
at the front of the boat. Um and you see in front

1839
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
of you like there's a key like left in in

1840
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
the engine. Um and no one's in

1841
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
(Ali Leonard)
I'm going to put in the second phone. I'm going to turn
-

(Christopher Hooper)
there.

1842
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
on the

1843
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
(Tyram)
I mean, he's about to
-

(Ellis Taylor)
do it. He
-

(Ali Leonard)
engines. How do we feel about

1844
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
did. He said earlier no one turned them on. So
-

(Ali Leonard)
this?

1845
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
(Tyram)
die.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
they might not be broken. They might just not be

1846
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
on.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Well, I figure if they're on, then if

1847
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
the dragon hits the boat, he'll hit the engines and he'll get

1848
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah, I like it. There's ores. We can always

1849
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
use ores to get home. It'll take a long
-

(Ali Leonard)
hurt. Either way, he's going to get f***** up. He's going to f****** the

1850
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
boat. The boat might as well f*** him

1851
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,000
(Ali Leonard)
up.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
It happened. All right, you

1852
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,000
(Tyram)
That'd be so embarrassing for this dragon if he just dies
-

(Christopher Hooper)
starting the

1853
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
(Tyram)
like a manatee.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
time.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
engines. A poor

1854
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,000
(Tyram)
Honestly, yeah, that makes me super sad. I hate that that happens to manities.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
manatee.

1855
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um um you you crank you

1856
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you crank that

1857
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ignition and uh you

1858
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
hear the choke and the engine catch and uh down

1859
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
(Tyram)
f***.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
in the engine room you start to hear the as it's starting

1860
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
up. Um,

1861
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and you hear in that

1862
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
room, you hear comms of other

1863
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
boats and they are saying, "There's more dragons coming in.

1864
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
There's more dragons. They're coming in for the south. Prepare. Prepare. Let's get in

1865
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
movement." Um, and uh,

1866
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you're hearing these radio. Hey, we read you loud and clear.

1867
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
(Ali Leonard)
I'm
-

(Christopher Hooper)
We're moving around. It looks like the original blue

1868
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
dragon is down is down in the water. We have lost

1869
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sight. We are coming down to the south.

1870
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um and uh that's what you hear around you. Are you doing anything else? Uh El

1871
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
(Ali Leonard)
I'm
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Smith, you probably have maybe a bonus action if you

1872
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
just saying over psychic phone what the

1873
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
radios are saying. That's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
want. Okay,

1874
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
it.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool.

1875
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Brew, you are conscious

1876
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
there. You hear engines thrumming.

1877
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, it

1878
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
looks like you only hear one of

1879
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
two engines running.
-

(Justin Hale)
Mhm.

1880
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
Congratulations.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, there's Liliana standing over you like an

1881
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
angel. Um, what are you doing?

1882
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
(Justin Hale)
Um, with

1883
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,000
(Justin Hale)
my amazing perception, do I know what engine's not

1884
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Um do you know

1885
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
what engine is not running?
-

(Justin Hale)
running? Yeah. You said you said one

1886
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yes. With your um what is your passive
-

(Justin Hale)
engine's others aren't. Okay. Yeah.

1887
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
perception? 18. With your passive

1888
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
perception, you're able to look at the engine on the

1889
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right and the engine on the left, and it looks like one has all

1890
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
its timing belts and everything running, and the other one is not

1891
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
doing anything or making any noise. And you think that

1892
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
That's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
maybe the left one is probably not

1893
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,000
(Justin Hale)
18. I'm a little hesitant, but I think Yeah, maybe. Maybe that's right.

1894
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
pretty.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
running.
-

(Justin Hale)
All right, I'm gonna go uh I'm gonna go look at that engine. See if I

1895
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, go ahead. Give me an arana
-

(Justin Hale)
can fix

1896
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,000
(Justin Hale)
it. You want arana?

1897
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
check.
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay. Okay.

1898
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
You
-

(Justin Hale)
Uh

1899
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh can tell that the bottom of it has been

1900
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
smashed in and is currently blocking

1901
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um gears and s*** that are in an

1902
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,000
(Justin Hale)
16. Well, there's your problem.

1903
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
engine.
-

(Justin Hale)
Um, does it do

1904
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
(Justin Hale)
I know if there's any chance of being able

1905
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
(Justin Hale)
to cobble something together to fix this quickly to make

1906
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yes, but
-

(Justin Hale)
it just like operable?

1907
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it's going to it's going to happen next turn
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay, that's

1908
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
probably. Um
-

(Justin Hale)
fine.

1909
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
yes, let's uh return to that. Um,

1910
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Olivia, uh, unless there's anything else you wanted to do. I think that was that was most

1911
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
of it. Okay, Olivia, you
-

(Justin Hale)
Yeah, that's

1912
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
are on deck. Uh, you've seen the dragon dive

1913
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
into the water with a few um,
-

(Justin Hale)
good.

1914
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Dragonites and um,

1915
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
So, it's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
yeah. And you're up there by yourself now,

1916
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
gone. Uh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
actually.

1917
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
well, I know that there are more dragons coming,

1918
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
so I'm going to stay

1919
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
on deck, I guess. Get

1920
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
ready for more. Wouldn't we talk about ready in action?

1921
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Like, yeah. Can we do that? I feel like there were
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yes. You an aridian

1922
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
some sort of funky rules where like we couldn't do that.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
action. Yeah.

1923
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, no. I'm a generous DM. I will let

1924
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay, cool.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you use the rule ready and

1925
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I don't know. Well, so I want to do I just want to like sit there

1926
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
like watching the skies, holding my axe, ready to just

1927
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
like smash any dragons that
-

(Christopher Hooper)
action.

1928
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Yeah. Give me a perception

1929
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
come. Real dice. Real dice. We don't trust
-

(Christopher Hooper)
check.

1930
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
you. Oh, 18 plus

1931
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
zero.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
18 plus zero. Um,

1932
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
yeah, just just basically

1933
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
on the other side of this like I

1934
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
don't know what you want to call it, vortex like empty empty

1935
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
ocean part. You see that they're uh to

1936
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
the south are these two boats

1937
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and they are heading straight towards these approaching winged

1938
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
figures. Um they can just make out their silhouettes that are

1939
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
and it looks like the boats and the dragons are kind of on a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
approaching.

1940
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
course for each other. The dragons aren't heading for us.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um yeah, they

1941
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
are heading for you, but they're going through the boats first, it looks

1942
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. I'll relay that to everyone and then I will touch
-

(Christopher Hooper)
like.

1943
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
myself again.

1944
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. And um and where are you touching

1945
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Are we doing
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Um um you know

1946
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
yourself? Okay. Great.

1947
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
gently I'll myself
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Awesome. Um all

1948
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
freezing?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
right.

1949
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
(Tyram)
Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You continue to hear very little.

1950
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
It's eerily quiet. Silus, it's your

1951
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
turn. Which is great cuz you

1952
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
just walked away. Is

1953
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Then wait with ready in action. Do I get to do it as soon as
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it snack

1954
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,000
(Tyram)
Sorry, I had to deal with my cat. What's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
they like come in?

1955
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
It's an
-

(Christopher Hooper)
time? Oh, good. It's your turn. Um, with ready action, you

1956
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
set a trigger and I assumed your trigger was

1957
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. Yes, that's my trigger.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dragons being in reach uh when you will use your check.

1958
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
(Tyram)
up? Um
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. And I'm allowing you to

1959
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
do that not just because it's in the rules, but because I'm a kind

1960
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah, I there was something that we tried. Yeah, I don't know what

1961
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,000
(Tyram)
You say it often enough, it'll eventually be
-

(Ellis Taylor)
it was. That's hides what
-

(Christopher Hooper)
DM.

1962
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
The recording shows
-

(Ellis Taylor)
my memory is saying. It's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yep. It's my goal.

1963
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:04,000
(Tyram)
true.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
that is a time

1964
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
(Tyram)
Okay. Um, do I see the dragon that dove under the
-

(Luke Neverisky)
DM.

1965
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,000
(Tyram)
water here?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1966
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, no you don't. Uh, if you want you

1967
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
can look harder for your

1968
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,000
(Tyram)
Okay, I'd have to use my action for it
-

(Ellis Taylor)
fine.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
action. Yeah.

1969
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,000
(Tyram)
then be able to do anything I want to be able to do anything
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You have to act actively search for it. Yeah.

1970
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,000
(Tyram)
meaningful afterwards then. So there's really no
-

(Christopher Hooper)
That's what That's what

1971
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:36,000
(Tyram)
point. Yeah. All right.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I was

1972
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
(Tyram)
Um, I guess I'm going to

1973
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:44,000
(Tyram)
think at the uh at the rest of the party

1974
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,000
(Tyram)
here. Um, if we're going to book it, do we

1975
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:52,000
(Tyram)
want to like throw a sending stone down to Luna to see if like we can
-

(Christopher Hooper)
thinking.

1976
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,000
(Tyram)
talk to her through

1977
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
(Tyram)
it? Bro, you
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, sure. I

1978
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,000
(Tyram)
have that one for useless Victor, right? We can just go get to Victor's on the other end and try to

1979
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:08,000
(Tyram)
talk to her that way.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
mean, it's not
-

(Justin Hale)
Uh

1980
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,000
(Tyram)
Okay. So, something to
-

(Luke Neverisky)
useless.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Sure.
-

(Justin Hale)
yes, that does work.

1981
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,000
(Tyram)
think about as we flee here. Um, and then,

1982
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
(Tyram)
um, I'm going to climb back up on deck. I'm going
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Who's cut the best athletics to try and chuck it at

1983
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
(Tyram)
to I'm going to climb back up on deck, trying not to be within a straight
-

(Ellis Taylor)
her? Probably

1984
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
(Tyram)
line of anybody else in the party here. And

1985
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
(Tyram)
um I guess I'll already in action myself to throw a dagger at any

1986
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
(Tyram)
dragon that gets close enough for me to throw a dagger
-

(Ellis Taylor)
me.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
All

1987
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
right. And because I'm a kind DM, I will allow you to ready

1988
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and action.

1989
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,000
(Tyram)
at.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
The kind DM is being an awful

1990
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
(Tyram)
Thanks. The third lie
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, all right, Liliana, uh, you're
-

(Justin Hale)
Oh.

1991
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
(Tyram)
is to convince yourself.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
bully. I'll just
-

(Christopher Hooper)
up.

1992
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
keep saying it and it'll become true. That's how the world works,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

1993
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,000
(Tyram)
Sadly, that actually does work all too
-

(Ellis Taylor)
right? It

1994
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Um
-

(Ellis Taylor)
does.

1995
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
um how big is our
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Uh-huh. It's huge

1996
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
boat? What is that huge

1997
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,000
(Tyram)
often.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
class? Oh
-

(Christopher Hooper)
now. It's huger than the huge class, which I think is

1998
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
jeez.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
only bigger than big.

1999
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
So, I mean, do we have like a

2000
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
freaking Royal Caribbean cruise ship now? Huge

2001
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
It's um you kind of went

2002
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
from like you kind of went from like

2003
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
a like a like a

2004
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
class.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
shrimp boat to a

2005
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
like I don't know crab boat I think is a little

2006
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
bigger or like A Alaskan

2007
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,000
(Tyram)
All the campaigns
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cruise boat.

2008
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
(Tyram)
inevitably converge upon us creating cruise
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Okay. Yes. I was kind
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2009
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
(Tyram)
ships.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
No.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
of hoping that we were going to run across uh not Olivia,

2010
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Dne's like elderly cruise ship and they were going to help us out of the

2011
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
water. It's still going
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah. Now I hope y'all don't run into

2012
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:20,000
(Tyram)
I'm trying to remember the name of the the cruise ship. It was like forest something, right? Or
-

(Christopher Hooper)
them.

2013
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,000
(Tyram)
something forest. That's it. That's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
hard. No, it was Haven. Yeah,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um I thought it was Haven.

2014
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Haven. It's self
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um,

2015
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
sustaining. They never have to

2016
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:36,000
(Tyram)
right.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
trying to

2017
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
see. So, the spell

2018
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
hallucinatory terrain doesn't actually change
-

(Ellis Taylor)
dock.

2019
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
the it's not like a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool.

2020
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
It just changes the like texture of

2021
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
a terrain I think if I'm reading this

2022
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
correctly. Make a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. To like you can make it velvet

2023
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
natural. Yes. I guess I cannot I guess I'm trying to discern
-

(Christopher Hooper)
or

2024
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
if what I can do is to cast this notori like

2025
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
underneath the like around the boat to basically act as camouflage uh

2026
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
from below. Um, but I don't think that's the intent of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
something.

2027
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
this bill because it says the pond can maybe be

2028
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
seen like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope or a rock stream gully like a wide and

2029
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
smooth road, which makes me think that I'm not creating

2030
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
an illusion per

2031
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
se. The tactile characters in the train. No. All right, never mind.

2032
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

2033
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Um, all

2034
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
right. Then in that case,

2035
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I'm going to uh What's my health? What's my health?

2036
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Six. I should heal myself.

2037
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Uh, I too will touch

2038
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:04,000
(Tyram)
These these St.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
myself just all over. Just
-

(Ellis Taylor)
All the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Uh, were you touching

2039
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:08,000
(Tyram)
George Knights are rubbing off on you guys in the worst possible
-

(Luke Neverisky)
really all over.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
ladies.

2040
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
yourself? Mhm. This is what you have to do to kill

2041
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,000
(Tyram)
way.
-

comfortably um understand like how

2075
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,000
(Ali Leonard)
Great.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
to run this ship. With a

(Christopher Hooper)
15, you um there are lights buzzing at

(Ali Leonard)
Sure. Mhm.

(Christopher Hooper)
you. You have movement.

2078
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it it it is very slow at first and

2079
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it seems like it's like gathering speed and you you're feeling that

2080
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it's drifting a little bit uh to the side. Um but

2081
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it's very very it's ramping up very

2082
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
Great. What if Ellsworth
-

(Christopher Hooper)
slowly at this

2083
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
is very familiar with the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
point.

2084
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
documentary Deadliest Catch?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Well, then

2085
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
You're right. You know what? You're right. That's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
she would have rolled higher on that arcana check. That

2086
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
true. I would have been Well, she didn't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
would have been the explanation.

2087
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
H. Did all of us watch that show? I loved
-

(Ali Leonard)
watch it close enough, apparently.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2088
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:28,000
(Tyram)
Which
-

(Ellis Taylor)
that show. It
-

(Ali Leonard)
So, I love that show. Sometimes I just watch one just just

2089
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
(Tyram)
show? I was kind of Which
-

(Ellis Taylor)
was just
-

(Ali Leonard)
for the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2090
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,000
(Tyram)
show? No, I never watched
-

(Luke Neverisky)
this
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Huh. Deadliest Catch.

2091
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
nostalgia.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
That was actually what I had in my mind when I said crab ship. I was like,

2092
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:44,000
(Tyram)
that.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
guy.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Oh, that's what I was
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I think that's bigger than a shrimp boat. Like I

2093
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
wondering.
-

(Ali Leonard)
It's a She's a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
think it's like significantly bigger than a shrimp boat.

2094
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.
-

(Ali Leonard)
big What was that book called? Like the

2095
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm. There were a couple of them. I
-

(Ali Leonard)
Northwestern.

2096
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
don't remember their
-

(Ali Leonard)
Yeah, that's the only one I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2097
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
names.
-

(Ali Leonard)
remember. A lot of them, the captains would die and then you'd be sad because you're like, "Oh,

2098
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah. Smoking and
-

(Ali Leonard)
yeah." Because smoking and drinking and

2099
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
drinking, staying up for multiple hours, multiple
-

(Ali Leonard)
drugs. Oh, right. You do

2100
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
days. No, not at

(Ali Leonard)
not lead healthy lifestyles,

2101

(Ellis Taylor)
all.
-

(Ali Leonard)
right? Great. Yeah. So,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
So, uh yeah, you just light one

2102
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
I'm I'm really trying. Yeah. There's a

2103
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
pack of cigarettes right there
-

(Christopher Hooper)
up.

2104
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,000
(Ali Leonard)
for some reason.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You did watch deadliest catch, but the thing you remembered from

2105
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah. is just pain
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it is the captain smoking a

2106
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
She's like, "Maybe this will help me drive this thing
-

(Ali Leonard)
smoking just and then the cup of

2107
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
better.
-

(Ali Leonard)
cold coffee and I'm like, "Okay, I gotta get in the

2108
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:48,000
(Ali Leonard)
zone." And then I get on the radio and
-

(Christopher Hooper)
bunch.

2109
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
(Ali Leonard)

2127
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,000
(Ali Leonard)

(Ali Leonard)
that. One is currently broken from

2160
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
what I can see because the blue dragon we are

2161
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
fighting did go under the water and hit it with its face.

2162
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
So that is broken. We are currently fixing it. So I am

(Ali Leonard)
Yeah.

02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
It's an
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

(Justin Hale)
need to be replaced. Yeah. You know, if

2191
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:20,000
(Justin Hale)
there's if there's cogs

2192
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,000
(Luke Neverisky)
bugs.
-

(Justin Hale)
or other things like cogs, we can find replacements or make

2193
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:28,000
(Justin Hale)
some out of makeshift things.

2194
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Mhm.

(Justin Hale)
Uh, we need some belts, pulleys, and such. We got rubber bands. We

02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um

02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,000
(Tyram)
How much duct tape do you
-

(Christopher Hooper)
unless All right.

2197
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
(Tyram)
have? Just
-

(Justin Hale)
this. One can never have too much duct

2198
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,000
(Tyram)
make a propeller out of duct tape.
-

(Justin Hale)
tape. What you guys don't

2199
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,000
(Justin Hale)
realize is the the the pee hole has uh just unlimited

2200
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
So
-

(Justin Hale)
amounts of duct tape.

2201
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
(Tyram)
It's in the item description. Yeah, just endless
-

(Christopher Hooper)
yeah, well that's how it

2202
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
works. Um all

2203
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right. So, um, unless you have a something specific, I'm

02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
going to say a fairly high arcana

2205
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:16,000
(Tyram)
tape.

(Christopher Hooper)
check, um, of 20

2206
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh, with, um, there are different like failure states here if
-

(Justin Hale)
Mhm.

2207
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you don't make that or you can do an athletics check

2208
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)

2209
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,000

02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
No, not a sitting
-

(Justin Hale)

(Justin Hale)
D8.

2221
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
Oh,
-

(Justin Hale)
Let me indictate this one. Okay, let's

2222
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,000
(Justin Hale)
do this. Oh, 19. Perfect.

2223
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
me.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Wow.
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay, plus a board. That's 30 19 21

2224
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,000
(Justin Hale)
22 22 plus 8 makes a 30, my friend.

2225
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um okay.

2226
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um so

2227
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you see around you um you have lots of duct

2228
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
tape and so one of the ways that you can
-

(Justin Hale)
Mhm. So

2229
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
undent something is to get something super sticky
-

(Justin Hale)
much

2230
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and pull out the dent. And so you're able to

2231
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Please.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
basically stick a huge glob of duct

2232
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Do they touch each
-

(Christopher Hooper)
tape and then pull a lever on it and pull

2233
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
broken car
-

(Christopher Hooper)
out the dent. And after that happens, you hear

2234
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
the a huge like kick as it

2235
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
kind of backfires, letting out this like huge pressure

2236
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
buildup. Um, give me a dexterity

2237
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
into
-

(Christopher Hooper)
saving throw.
-

(Justin Hale)
Snap the plus three work

2238
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:28,000
(Justin Hale)
here. Okay,

2239
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
(Justin Hale)
good. Deck save. Okay. 15

2240
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yes. Okay,

(Justin Hale)
17 uh

2241
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
great. Um, so you get uh just

2242
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
half of uh the 16, so eight

2243
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
bludgeoning damage.
-

(Justin Hale)
20.

2244
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I know
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay. Everything is trying to kill me

2245
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
it's so rough out here.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah, that's
-

(Justin Hale)
here.

2246
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:00,000
(Tyram)
s***.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
right. Um, okay, that's great. It

2247
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sounds like the engine's back on. Um, it's starting

2248
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
up.

2249
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, Elizabeth, you at the front start to feel the the ship

2250
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah, perfect.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
kind of evening out a little bit.

2251
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, Brute, anything else you want to
-

(Justin Hale)
Oh. Uh, I'm gonna

02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:24,000
(Justin Hale)
I'm gonna toss my um Victor

2253
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:28,000
(Justin Hale)
sending stone to somebody out top

2254
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
do? What? Uh, so you're in the engine

2255
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
room. The only person with you is Liliana right
-

(Justin Hale)
side.

2256
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Sure
-

(Christopher Hooper)
now.
-

(Justin Hale)
Okay. Hey Lis, can you take this top

2257
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:44,000
(Justin Hale)
side? Let's say

2258
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Okay,
-

(Justin Hale)
I did that before I did all the engine

2259
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
cool.
-

(Justin Hale)
crap.

2260
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
And um you know, now it's not eerily quiet because you hear two engines going.

2261
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
can. Nice.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Olivia, you're

2262
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Uh, I guess Liliana is not here with this ending
-

(Ali Leonard)
Great.

2263
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I'm a Lex.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
stone.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
up. Nope.

2264
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Um, just going to

2265
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
like look at the dragons, make sure they're not coming any closer, and then

2266
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
like look over the side and be

2267
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
like, "Blue dragon not coming

2268
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, yeah. Give me a perception

2269
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
back." Can we say I'm investigating the waters for a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
check.

2270
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:36,000
(Tyram)
If we left right now, would we be abandoning those George guys who
-

(Ellis Taylor)
dragon? Dang it.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
No.

2271
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
(Tyram)
were on the dragon?
-

(Ellis Taylor)
I have a feeling they did

2272
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
I mean, I haven't left. I'm just moving the
-

(Justin Hale)
That' be

2273
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
dead.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
11.

2274
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, you see

2275
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
a a dark figure.

2276
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
engines.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, it seems small from this perspective coming up
-

(Justin Hale)
fun.

2277
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
from the water. Um, off from the distance, it looks like the dragons

2278
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and the boats are engaged um

2279
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
in combat. Um, cool. Uh, you could do a

2280
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
little bit extra if you

2281
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
want or hold keep holding that

2282
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I'll just keep holding that action. I have a feeling it's coming

2283
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
back. I'll just keep I'll I'll be
-

(Christopher Hooper)
action. All right.

2284
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
staring down the water watching this dark thing coming at us ready

2285
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay, cool.

2286
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, Silus, you're

2287
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:44,000
(Tyram)
Okay. Um, if Rude thought that about the uh the

2288
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,000
(Tyram)
orb, I'm going to try to uh go back up to the top

2289
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:52,000
(Tyram)
deck and uh what what would
-

(Ellis Taylor)
attack.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
up.

2290
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:56,000
(Tyram)
you make me roll to try to chuck the orb down to uh

2291
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,000
(Tyram)
Luna?
-

(Ellis Taylor)
the
-

(Justin Hale)
the

2292
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
(Tyram)
Not the orb. The orb. The the sending stone. I
-

(Ellis Taylor)
orb. Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um

2293
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:08,000
(Tyram)
sorry. Sorry. Wrong wrong setting entirely. The sending
-

(Ellis Taylor)
stone.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
so um

2294
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,000
(Tyram)
stone. Isa here. Not
-

(Christopher Hooper)
athletics uh you are

2295
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,000
(Tyram)
over here. Isa
-

(Christopher Hooper)
getting

2296
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,000
(Tyram)
here. Yeah.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um we can we can use him for this I
-

(Justin Hale)
stone.

2297
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:24,000
(Tyram)
because like I am not suited for this and he is

2298
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
think if you two want to do it together, I think that that's the only way this is going

2299
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:32,000
(Tyram)
like okay I will uh try to get
-

(Christopher Hooper)
to work. Uh,

2300
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:36,000
(Tyram)
with like oh hey I'm glad you finally found your contacts which

2301
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:40,000
(Tyram)
you had lost

2302
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,000
(Tyram)
um we're going to try to chuck the orb not the orb the

2303
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,000
(Tyram)
stone down to Luna
-

(Christopher Hooper)
well,
-

(Justin Hale)
Bring it

2304
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,000
(Tyram)
ascending stone that connects us with Victor sending stone down
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
okay.

2305
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:56,000
(Tyram)
to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, okay. The

2306
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
DC for this is really high because

2307
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you're you're to start you're already 30 feet or
-

(Justin Hale)
off.

2308
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
300 ft above the ocean floor on

2309
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,000
(Tyram)
Luna. Well, 300 feet
-

(Christopher Hooper)
top of being um, you

2310
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:16,000
(Tyram)
down, right? So that the 300 feet is kind of irrelevant. We just got to get it
-

(Christopher Hooper)
know,

2311
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:20,000
(Tyram)
horizontally over
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Right.

2312
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um it is

2313
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh even down you're

2314
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it's it's getting over to where

2315
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it's if you want to do strongest by its head. You can probably get a

2316
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
weak signal at least by um you know the rest of the

2317
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:44,000
(Tyram)
enough.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
skeleton. Consider also the boat has started to

2318
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:48,000
(Tyram)
Okay. So, what do we need to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
move away. Um,

2319
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
so I'm going to set the DC here.

2320
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, baseline to get to the

2321
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
skeleton 15. Um, which

2322
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
(Tyram)
get?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
is not that bad, but that is the bare

2323
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,000
(Tyram)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
minimum. Um, to get a strong signal, we're going to

2324
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:12,000
(Tyram)
Um Okay. Um, you said
-

(Christopher Hooper)
say 25.

2325
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:16,000
(Tyram)
that um, me and Omar are doing this together. How does that

2326
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
So, we'll do a tag team roll here. So, you'll both roll and you'll take the

2327
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,000
(Tyram)
work? Okay. All right. Um,

2328
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,000
(Tyram)
I, uh, well, I'll this seems like a good time for me to use my

2329
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,000
(Tyram)
bar juice if I need to. All

2330
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:36,000
(Tyram)
right. Okay. Never f******
-

(Christopher Hooper)
best.

2331
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,000
(Tyram)
mind. There's no possible way I could beat that. Actually, I could possibly beat that,

2332
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:44,000
(Tyram)
but there's no point. All

2333
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:48,000
(Tyram)
right. All right. Um, I'll see if I get an AT
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Let's see if you get a natural

2334
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,000
(Tyram)
20. Sure. I didn't, but
-

(Christopher Hooper)
28. I can't believe I

2335
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:56,000
(Tyram)
um I'm actually really glad I didn't get an AT 20 there because that would have been honestly
-

(Christopher Hooper)
rolled that. That's

2336
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:00,000
(Tyram)
pretty frustrating to waste it on that. But
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ridiculous.

2337
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:04,000
(Tyram)
yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Says, "Oh, let me help you out." and takes

2338
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
it and just like pro baseball arc

2339
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
and form just like

2340
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right next to um the ritual site like right in

2341
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
there it says

2342
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:24,000
(Tyram)
Great
-

(Christopher Hooper)
just like my playing

2343
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,000
(Tyram)
job, Ma. Oh no, your contact lens just fell out

2344
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
days oh my goodness
-

(Justin Hale)
That's

2345
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um all right and um

2346
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:40,000
(Tyram)
again.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I think at this point uh we are going to exit

2347
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
combat.
-

(Justin Hale)
I didn't

2348
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,000
(Tyram)
We almost got that dragon. That dragon survived us.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um

2349
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:52,000
(Tyram)
We didn't survive the
-

(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um that's true. Um
-

(Justin Hale)
die. Yes.

2350
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
right.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
very true. Uh part of being an intelligent creature is
-

(Justin Hale)
Second.

2351
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
knowing when to leave.

2352
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and you see uh that shadow that's heading

2353
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:08,000
(Tyram)
dragon.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
towards you um is one of the dragon knights and

2354
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you see it rise to the surface and and then

2355
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
Are they
-

(Christopher Hooper)
behind it you see two other

2356
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
dead? Okay, then I don't need to turn back.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
figures they're

2357
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
a Oh, we're
-

(Ali Leonard)
Then I don't need to turn this hunk of junk

2358
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Okay, I guess we'll just No, we fish their bodies
-

(Ali Leonard)
around. They don't You don't want
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dead.

2359
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
It's so sad they
-

(Ellis Taylor)
out. I mean, how long
-

(Ali Leonard)
a ocean

2360
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
die.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
did How long did it take us to get here?
-

(Ali Leonard)
funeral? They already And they've already been buried in the

2361
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
ocean. I'll turn it around

2362
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:44,000
(Ali Leonard)
if you want me to. It's just going to take approximately 20

2363
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,000
(Tyram)
Damn, that is a

2364
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:52,000
(Tyram)
bad cornering
-

(Ali Leonard)
minutes. The boat has been made

2365
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Oh, I do have Reviva 5, but I think it's been
-

(Ali Leonard)
very

2366
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:00,000
(Tyram)
speed.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
I think
-

(Ellis Taylor)
too
-

(Ali Leonard)
large.

2367
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:04,000
(Tyram)
Well, it's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
long.
-

(Ali Leonard)
So, out of all of those people in the boat, nobody's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I don't think so. But,

2368
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I do have spare the dying,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you know,

2369
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:12,000
(Luke Neverisky)
I think you're dead.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
but I think they're

2370
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,000
(Ellis Taylor)
dead. Dead. It's
-

(Ali Leonard)
alive. I'm slowly making a

2371
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:20,000
(Tyram)
I don't know. Can you like mage hand to pull
-

(Ellis Taylor)
okay. At worst, we're just going to we're going to bring their bodies
-

(Ali Leonard)
turn.

2372
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:24,000
(Tyram)
them into the See if pull them closer. See if they're alive or
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Dead.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
back.

2373
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:28,000
(Tyram)
not.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Do any of us have mage hand? Oh,
-

(Ali Leonard)
I

2374
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
you do. Yeah, I'm not going to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Revivify does cost uh 300 gold pieces, so keep

2375
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
reify
-

(Ali Leonard)
do. Yeah, we need that pivot up
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that in mind.

2376
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:40,000
(Ellis Taylor)
them. I can stabilize
-

(Ali Leonard)
front. So, do I stop turning or what

2377
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
them. I can stabilize them with spare the dying, but I'm sure Tover just wants them
-

(Ali Leonard)
are we doing?

2378
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
to be dead. It's okay. I want to get
-

(Christopher Hooper)
You can get

2379
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
them. I don't want to just leave them. Leave their
-

(Ali Leonard)
Okay. And
-

(Christopher Hooper)
him.

2380
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:56,000
(Ali Leonard)
then I make I

2381
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:00,000
(Tyram)
Yeah,
-

(Ellis Taylor)
bodies.
-

(Ali Leonard)
do call everyone up to the wheelhouse because I can't really leave the

2382
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
wheelhouse. Do I have an intercom that's not attached to the other intercom? Like
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay.

2383
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:08,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm. Not the
-

(Ali Leonard)
an internal intercom?

2384
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
radio.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Yeah, there's the radio and then an

2385
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
intercom and then over the like internal intercom I want to be

2386
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
like everybody up to the wheelhouse please

2387
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,000
(Tyram)
I'm going to add up to the wheelhouse.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Ali Leonard)
over and I want to see if anybody
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um um so

2388
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
comes
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you're heading out uh to get the to

2389
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:32,000
(Ali Leonard)
bodies. Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um to get the bodies, right? Um, so

2390
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:36,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Olivia heads out there. Uh, everyone else heading to the

2391
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
wheelhouse. Um,

2392
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:44,000
(Tyram)
You know, I'm really
-

(Christopher Hooper)
cool.

2393
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:48,000
(Tyram)
disappointed in these alleged dragon
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.

2394
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:52,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Hey, they're trying their
-

(Ali Leonard)
The

2395
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:56,000
(Tyram)
hunters.
-

(Ali Leonard)
engines weren't on. I will say that. I mean, you could have at least had it

2396
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
running, you know, kind of
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um,

2397
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
best.
-

(Ali Leonard)
like I do have

2398
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:08,000
(Ali Leonard)
a question. So, I did turn the radio off because they were getting really

2399
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:12,000
(Ali Leonard)
annoying, but the people that we

2400
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:16,000
(Ali Leonard)
came with, the dragon

2401
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
knights are on the radio because there's other boats that are being attacked by dragons.

2402
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:24,000
(Ali Leonard)
And then headquarters is on there as well. They don't really care

2403
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,000
(Ali Leonard)
about that because they were like, "We'll support you." But then they were like, "What's the

2404
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:32,000
(Ali Leonard)
status of the orb?" And they said it like 15 times and I didn't feel

2405
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:36,000
(Tyram)
I'll think of you
-

(Ali Leonard)
comfortable saying anything. You know what

2406
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:40,000
(Tyram)
guys. I'll think of you guys there. So,
-

(Ali Leonard)
I mean? If we're at

2407
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,000
(Tyram)
their agenda, I feel like we don't support their agenda with the
-

(Luke Neverisky)
That's
-

(Ali Leonard)
the wheelhouse, I

2408
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:48,000
(Tyram)
orb. Maybe we just tell them we lost
-

(Ali Leonard)
figured that's what I was

2409
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:52,000
(Tyram)
it. or
-

(Luke Neverisky)
All
-

(Ali Leonard)
thinking. I was like, "But I can't do that.

2410
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:56,000
(Tyram)
that it got destroyed during the ritual or some s***. I
-

(Ali Leonard)
Yeah, like it got destroyed or like a

2411
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:00,000
(Ali Leonard)
dragon took it or like something, but like

2412
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:04,000
(Tyram)
don't.
-

(Ali Leonard)
I can't say that cuz they'll see through me. You know what I

2413
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:08,000
(Tyram)
Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay. Um Oh, we could How about let's just

2414
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:12,000
(Tyram)
go with a simple explanation. Um, it fell out
-

(Luke Neverisky)
right.

2415
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,000
(Tyram)
and went into the ocean during the dragon
-

(Luke Neverisky)
That's

2416
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:20,000
(Tyram)
fight. Now, do you do now do
-

(Luke Neverisky)
easy.
-

(Ali Leonard)
mean? Okay. Do you wanna

2417
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:24,000
(Tyram)
you want me to lie for
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.
-

(Ali Leonard)
Do you want to tell That would be great. You can call yourself

2418
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:28,000
(Tyram)
you? Oh, I definitely am.
-

(Ali Leonard)
captain if you want because I did

2419
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:32,000
(Ali Leonard)
not tell them who I was. I just put on an accent. And you have to say over at the end of

2420
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,000
(Ali Leonard)
it or they get very

2421
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:40,000
(Tyram)
Yeah. Is is the actual captain still around? like Captain Buckle, I think
-

(Ali Leonard)
angry. And I called our boat

2422
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:44,000
(Tyram)
his name
-

(Ali Leonard)
big. Is he just like asleep in the captain's

2423
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:48,000
(Tyram)
was. Someone else I'm pretty disappointed with here. Not having the
-

(Ellis Taylor)
He's

2424
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:52,000
(Tyram)
engines ready to
-

(Ellis Taylor)
napping.
-

(Ali Leonard)
chair?

2425
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Um, wait. What's your what's your deception

2426
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:00,000
(Tyram)
go. Uh, plus uh

2427
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:04,000
(Tyram)
11
-

(Luke Neverisky)
score? I don't
-

(Ali Leonard)
Also, I called the boat baked stakes, just so everyone knows. Or

2428
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
want to I don't want to steal your moment, but I do have a plus 13 of
-

(Ali Leonard)
sinks. Bake

(Justin Hale)
Thanks.

2429
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:12,000
(Tyram)
Liliana, you're good at lying to
-

(Luke Neverisky)
this

2430
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
option. Sometimes a white lie, you just got to do it.

2431
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:20,000
(Tyram)
people. Well, okay, fine.
-

(Ali Leonard)

2432
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:24,000
(Tyram)
Yeah. Hey, if you want to do it. I mean, I feel like lying is kind of my thing, but Yeah.

(Luke Neverisky)
I feel like you guys have been pulling the weight. I mean,

2434
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:32,000
(Tyram)
It's also true, and I don't know
-

(Luke Neverisky)
I'm just got here. I got to, you

2435
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:36,000
(Tyram)
um how to explain this in character, but

2436
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:40,000
(Tyram)
um I also can't do worse than a

2437
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:44,000
(Tyram)
21.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
know, Oh, you have a really good floor on your lying
-

(Ali Leonard)
distinctive.

2438
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:48,000
(Luke Neverisky)
skills. Well, then by all
-

(Justin Hale)
Do you on the black

2439
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:52,000
(Tyram)
Yeah. Like, I've gotten so good at lying that my

2440
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:56,000
(Tyram)
worst lies, if I had to put a number on them, would be a 21.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
means, it would be like a
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.

2441
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
21. That's true. I like your
-

(Justin Hale)
jack?

2442
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:04,000
(Luke Neverisky)
odds. All right, by all means, go
-

(Ali Leonard)
I'm just like offering cigarettes to

2443
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:08,000
(Luke Neverisky)
talk. I'll be here for you back
-

(Ellis Taylor)
I'm so glad Olivia's not

2444
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:12,000
(Tyram)
Okay.
-

(Luke Neverisky)

-

(Ali Leonard)
everyone.

2445
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:16,000
(Tyram)
Uh, come in, Leroy. This is big sinks
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, you turn on the radio. So, you turn on the

2446
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
radio and there mid-sentence be like, "So, that's the

2447
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:24,000
(Ellis Taylor)
around.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
plan. We're going to have a big old barbecue and

2448
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
then um probably we want you to bring the ribs if that's okay.

2449
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
We know that Captain Buckle is known for his ribs.

2450
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
So, as soon as you get back and tell us about the orb, we

2451
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
Hey.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
can set out about who's going to bring the coles slaw and the rest

2452
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:44,000
(Tyram)
over
-

(Christopher Hooper)
of the um so as I was saying before um this

2453
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
is all based on the book Moby Dick and

2454
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:52,000
(Tyram)
I turn the radio back off real
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that was largely the inspiration

2455
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:56,000
(Tyram)
quick. I got to wait a couple of minutes and then turn it back
-

(Ali Leonard)
Hi. I did I did silence. I did tell him

2456
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:00,000
(Tyram)
on. See if he's still
-

(Ali Leonard)
I was turning off the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
for see the the

2457
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:04,000
(Ali Leonard)
radio.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
emphasis is that this was largely

2458
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:08,000
(Tyram)
going. Uh
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um inspired by um the

02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you relay the status of the dragon

2524
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh over? Yes. Uh HQ. Um we

2525
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
believe that the Dragon is looking pretty bloodied.

2526
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um it looks like they uh are making sure to sink

2527
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
our vessel and kill all aboard, but they uh do
-

(Justin Hale)
like

2528
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
appear to be fleeing now um for safe harbor

2529
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
over. Hello Jenkins. This is Leroy.

2530
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um are you in need of aid? I'm sorry Leroy.

2531
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Uh this is Jenkins. Um, I would not advise you

2532
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
ADAS at this time. Um, we believe that the

2533
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
beautiful copper dragon is leaving the scene at this point.

2534
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Over. I'm sorry to hear that, Jenkins. Do you need our aid

2535
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
in any recovery of personnel that are found at

2536
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sea? Over. Oh, that's a mighty kind

2537
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
offer, Leroy. This is Jenkins. Um, I'm the last alive

2538
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
on this ship. Um, I am not the captain and

2539
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um, I have mortal wounds, so I will soon be bleeding

2540
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
out over. Well, that's a shame, Jenkins. We do

2541
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
not have a healer on deck at this point. Um, they were

2542
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
killed in the action, so we will not be able to revive you or heal you at

2543
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
this time, but we will remember you and celebrate you at

2544
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
the victory picnic. Over. Thank you,

2545
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:12,000
(Tyram)
And I I put my hand over the receiver like, can we can we get there in time?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Leroy.

2546
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:16,000
(Tyram)
Is this something we want to do?

2547
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:20,000
(Tyram)
Or that's an Ellsworth
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Olivia's fishing bodies out of the water.

2548
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:24,000
(Tyram)
question. How far away are they? I

2549
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Oh,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, they they're

2550
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:32,000
(Ellis Taylor)
they were small from when you described
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um they're they're

2551
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
probably they're probably like close to 40 minutes

2552
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:40,000
(Tyram)
mean, oh yeah, we're okay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
away. on

2553
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:44,000
(Tyram)
We're We're not going to make

2554
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:48,000
(Tyram)
it. Oh, and hey, what if we
-

(Luke Neverisky)
But hey, at least we'll celebrate them in the victory
-

(Ellis Taylor)
them.

2555
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
(Tyram)
uh made the boat smaller? Would that make us move faster again?

2556
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:56,000
(Luke Neverisky)
page.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
boat. The engine

2557
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
scale with the boat. The

2558
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:04,000
(Tyram)
What? Yeah, but what if we made the boat smaller and
-

(Christopher Hooper)
engine scale with the boat.

2559
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:08,000
(Tyram)
then cast in large on the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, that would be

2560
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,000
(Tyram)
engines? Brew is
-

(Christopher Hooper)
smart. But I don't think the brew is that

2561
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,000
(Tyram)
incredibly
-

(Christopher Hooper)
smart. Oh, yeah. Statistically,

2562
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:20,000
(Tyram)
smart.

2563
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:24,000
(Justin Hale)
I'm the smartest person in this room. I'm

2564
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:28,000
(Luke Neverisky)
You
-

(Justin Hale)
smarter than anybody at my height.

2565
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
sure are. You sure are.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
yeah. Hello,

2566
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Leroy. This is Jenkins. Um, I would just like to see if you

2567
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:40,000
(Ali Leonard)
What?
-

(Christopher Hooper)
could pass along a personal note to my sister, um,

2568
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Tiana. Um, just tell her that, um, sorry I'm

2569
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
going to miss her wedding. I will not be able to do best

2570
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
man duties. Um, if you could find a replacer for me to take care

2571
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
of that, that'd be great. Overt. Oh, sorry to hear that,

2572
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Jenkins. This is Leroy. I will pass along your message to your

2573
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
your sister and my best friend Tiana. And we will be sad

2574
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
to miss you at her wedding, but we will also mourn you at the

2575
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:12,000
(Tyram)
I mean, is there something we can do about this? I mean, I feel like we're
-

(Christopher Hooper)
victory picnic. Uh we'll remember you

2576
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:16,000
(Tyram)
kind of like made to feel really guilty about stuff we had

2577
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:20,000
(Tyram)
no control
-

(Luke Neverisky)
You know what you can do, Silus? You can write a great speech

2578
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:24,000
(Tyram)
over.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
for them at the Victory

2579
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:28,000
(Tyram)
Let's just
-

(Christopher Hooper)
forever.

2580
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Technic.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
And this goes on

2581
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:36,000
(Tyram)
go. I turn off the radio. This is very
-

(Christopher Hooper)
for a little bit longer.

2582
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Let's see how long
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and you

2583
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
start and you start heading back to

2584
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:48,000
(Tyram)
unproductive. Man, these guys are
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Grayport.

2585
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:52,000
(Tyram)
really, really bad at fighting dragons. Like
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um. Oh,

2586
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:56,000
(Tyram)
this was a catastrophe. Like what what are these guys even
-

(Luke Neverisky)
it

2587
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:00,000
(Tyram)
doing, you

2588
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
what? Um, I guess at this at

2589
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
this point, um, you have everyone aboard. Uh, the Dragon

2590
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Knights are resting at this point. Um, unconscious but

2591
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:16,000
(Tyram)
know? Good work
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
alive and stabilized.

2592
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:20,000
(Tyram)
team.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yay.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and uh it's pretty quiet the rest of the the

2593
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:24,000
(Tyram)
So overall, was it just the one boat that got like totaled or

2594
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:28,000
(Tyram)
what? Okay. Well, hey, I mean,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
ride. Seems so.

2595
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:32,000
(Tyram)
it's a quasi successful mission, I

2596
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:36,000
(Tyram)
guess, then after all. Although, our boat would have been

2597
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:40,000
(Tyram)
f***** without us.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
This is

2598
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah, these guys are like
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um you eventually see that it looks like the
-

(Justin Hale)
true.

2599
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
crew of the boat um was hiding in the quarters.

2600
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
s***** of our
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Um yes.

2601
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
(Ellis Taylor)
boat.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Um and

2602
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh it looks like uh one of the nice So you

2603
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
enlar you just kept the enlargement of the the boat, right? You

2604
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
didn't you didn't switch it to just the engines or anything like that.

2605
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um,
-

(Justin Hale)
No, that would make things because it doesn't I would imagine it doesn't

2606
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
so yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I didn't really want to think
-

(Justin Hale)
go to the props and all of the you know transmission

2607
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
about that. Um, but one thing that did

2608
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
also get enlarged with the boat is the the hail casts and they have been

2609
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
nervously drinking in their quarters, uh, waiting for the everything to
-

(Justin Hale)
Yes.

2610
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
calm down. And, um, eventually they start coming out of the

2611
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
quarters and, uh, Captain Buckle comes into the wheelhouse, says,

2612
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
"Hey, uh, and everything

2613
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
okay? The boat seems bigger. Are we on the same

2614
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
boat?
-

(Justin Hale)
The boat is the It seems the same size as

2615
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Am I

(Justin Hale)
shorter.

2619
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I'm the captain. What are you doing? Driving my boat. Well, thank you for driving my boat

2620

2642
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
to harbor. Remember, turn off the engines and let us know when we need to start

2643
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
rowing when we get into the harbor. It's a no wake zone, as you

2644
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:52,000
(Justin Hale)
of course. Of course I know

2645
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
know.

03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:32,000
(Tyram)
ruptured and it just fell into the
-

(Christopher Hooper)
lost. Oh

(Tyram)
ocean.

You guys can, but I feel like we need to uh we've got so

2717
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:44,000
(Tyram)
many wounded and the boats in rough shape. So, I just feel like it's just not

2718
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:48,000
(Tyram)
the not the time. We completed the ritual, so we did what we needed to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
in? Damn

2719
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)

03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
that we did so much, but I don't have anything to bring back. Was

2722
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,000
(Tyram)
do.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
really hoping for this promotion. All

Everyone's

2725
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:16,000
(Tyram)
Oh, we did hear on the radio that Jenkins passed away, but please don't say

2726
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:20,000
(Tyram)
too much about

boat. It is. That's
-

(Luke Neverisky)

boat. That's sad. I think

2729
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:32,000

probably enough said on the subject, but I just thought you'd want to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
his sister is getting

I never met him in any meaningful way, so I don't
-

(Christopher Hooper)
it'll be all

2733
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
right. I may be able to get a promotion because of

2734
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
the loss of captains on that

2735
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:56,000

-

body um floating along and

2766
03:10:56,000 --> 03:11:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh there's cheers at the docks and uh

2767
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
pulled up and uh they're all cheering as you exit the

2768
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
boat and

2769
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh there's um and that's where we'll leave it for tonight.

2770
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:20,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Well,
-

(Justin Hale)
Well, find that

2771
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
It's late and I see the fading

2772
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
in your old
-

(Justin Hale)
way. No, you

2773
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Well, yeah.
-

(Justin Hale)
don't. I

2774
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:36,000
(Justin Hale)
don't.

2775
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
eyes. And that's it.

2776
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:44,000
(Tyram)
Well, good work team. All
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, we didn't die. Close. We didn't
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yay! We did

2777
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:48,000
(Tyram)
right, so honestly, I would love it if we could talk to Luna, like
-

(Ellis Taylor)
it.

2778
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:52,000
(Tyram)
maybe get her perspective on
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm. Oh, yeah. I was gonna say it's

2779
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:56,000
(Tyram)
things.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
like perfect that it was Ma because it's his

2780
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:00,000
(Luke Neverisky)
die.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
goddess. They got to throw the

2781
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:04,000
(Tyram)
Yeah. So, now we just need to track
-

(Ellis Taylor)
thing. Also, you know, he's

2782
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:08,000
(Tyram)
down Victor and then we can use his orb, his stone to
-

(Ellis Taylor)
athletic and s***. Oh, yeah.

2783
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:12,000
(Tyram)
talk to
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Oh, I need to write that. Next
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. I love
-

(Justin Hale)
We go find

2784
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
time. Next time.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
that.
-

(Justin Hale)
Victor. Punch him in the face. Stone. His

2785
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:20,000
(Tyram)
uh
-

(Justin Hale)
stone. You got me saying orb

2786
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:24,000
(Tyram)
Yeah, my bad.
-

(Justin Hale)
now.

2787
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I love that. Uh

2788
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I love that y'all tied Victor into

2789
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:40,000
(Tyram)
Well, I mean, he's in town,
-

(Ellis Taylor)
And
-

(Christopher Hooper)
this. I didn't even have to. It's great.

2790
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:44,000
(Ellis Taylor)
then also we need to like go through the I don't know the data and
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2791
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:48,000
(Ellis Taylor)
figure out if we could have you whatever the information we got

2792
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:52,000
(Tyram)
so yeah, We need to we
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
from completing the ritual that we diverted from the dragon

2793
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:56,000
(Tyram)
need to slip away and see what information the George people were

2794
03:12:56,000 --> 03:13:00,000
(Tyram)
trying to get and see if it's something we can use.

2795
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Mhm. Yeah. So, I didn't want to RP that to belabor it. Um, but

2796
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you're able to get um a set of coordinates

2797
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
people.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
um off the machine um that you're able to to

2798
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:16,000
(Tyram)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
hijack um through the terminal, you know, with the

2799
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
keyboard and everything um pressing keys and such

2800
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
um on a floppy disc.
-

(Justin Hale)
Hold

2801
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Uh yeah. Yeah. Um, and
-

(Justin Hale)
off.

2802
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you're able to to get those.

2803
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:36,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, and uh, keep in mind also you uh

2804
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
sabotaged the other relays. Uh,

2805
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:44,000
(Christopher Hooper)
so they got um, now here's a question.

2806
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Did you um, sabotage it in a way that they just got

2807
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:52,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
like no signal or incorrect

2808
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
signals?
-

(Justin Hale)
I think we said incorrect signals,

2809
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I think
-

(Justin Hale)
right? We were purposely

2810
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
so. I think so. Um, so

2811
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
uh one thing next time I will try to remember is to show you a

2812
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
map and and the signals uh coordinates that you

2813
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:16,000
(Christopher Hooper)
got and um I'll let

2814
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:20,000
(Ali Leonard)
Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
you um choose some couple coordinates that

2815
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
you're sending them to.

2816
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:28,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um,
-

(Justin Hale)
luring.

2817
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
yeah, that was cool. I really thought I was going to

2818
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:36,000
(Luke Neverisky)
there.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
drown two of you. Um,

2819
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:40,000
(Christopher Hooper)
especially Silus, who I didn't realize had a con mod of

2820
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:44,000
(Tyram)
That was my
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yep.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
zero. I was like, "Oh,

2821
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:48,000
(Tyram)
finest turn was the one where I got to stab him and escape all at
-

(Christopher Hooper)
wow."

2822
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah. I was I was like, "Do you want to

2823
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
hang on?" I don't know. I mean, I could see utility in both. Oh, s***. You would
-

(Justin Hale)
Then heat.

2824
03:14:56,000 --> 03:15:00,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm. I
-

(Christopher Hooper)
drown

2825
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:04,000
(Tyram)
once.
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah.

2826
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:08,000
(Tyram)
Now that I can like teleport every turn, like I've got
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Yeah. Yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
immediately.

2827
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:12,000
(Tyram)
like top tier mobility, so you know, should should be

2828
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:16,000
(Tyram)
able to get myself out
-

(Christopher Hooper)
I I feel like to also

2829
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:20,000
(Christopher Hooper)
that like um that rogue feat

2830
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
of of uh if you succeed your

2831
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:28,000
(Tyram)
of.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
dexterity saving throw, you take no damage is

2832
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:32,000
(Tyram)
Yeah, it's great for
-

(Christopher Hooper)
like crazy on those AOE spells.

2833
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:36,000
(Tyram)
dragons. Although some of the dragons make you do con saves, which I would be
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Is

2834
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:40,000
(Tyram)
totally f*****, but or actually
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Yeah, I'll have to look

2835
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:44,000
(Tyram)
no, those don't exist. You shouldn't look for
-

(Christopher Hooper)
those

2836
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:48,000
(Christopher Hooper)
up. Um cuz

2837
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:52,000
(Tyram)
them. Oh yeah,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
like most AoE's are are deck saves for the most

2838
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:56,000
(Tyram)
like most things that just do damage are most often going to be

2839
03:15:56,000 --> 03:16:00,000
(Tyram)
deck
-

(Christopher Hooper)
part. Yeah. Um, so

2840
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
considering your decks is already very high and like the nice

2841
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
thing about those as a DM is usually they do damage even if you

2842
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:12,000
(Christopher Hooper)
succeed and the fact that even it gets rid of that is

2843
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:16,000
(Tyram)
saves. Monks have it too. So it also applies
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Mhm. Let's
-

(Christopher Hooper)
really really

2844
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:20,000
(Tyram)
to
-

(Luke Neverisky)
go.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
powerful. Yeah. Oh my god. So you have that and

2845
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:24,000
(Christopher Hooper)
then your party has so much healing across

2846
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:28,000
(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm. We we we
-

(Christopher Hooper)
everybody.

2847
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:32,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, yeah, you all have a little bit of healing,

2848
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:36,000
(Ellis Taylor)
corrected.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
which is really all you need to just get everyone back up. It's

2849
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:40,000
(Tyram)
I need to probably stock up on healing potions because I have
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Mhm.

2850
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:44,000
(Tyram)
absolutely nothing for healing people otherwise. And I think I'm

2851
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:48,000
(Tyram)
the only one in the
-

(Ali Leonard)
And you're always like up on top of a ceiling so it can't even get to
-

(Christopher Hooper)
crazy. That's

2852
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:52,000
(Tyram)
party.
-

(Ali Leonard)
you.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
true. You were very isolated, but like you were untouched the whole

2853
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
time, so it didn't even matter.

2854
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:00,000
(Tyram)
By sheer coincidence, I was able to not be in a straight line

2855
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:04,000
(Tyram)
with the other party members at any

2856
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:08,000
(Christopher Hooper)
I feel like Luke is experiencing my pain as a bard, which is

2857
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:12,000
(Ellis Taylor)
I'm
-

(Christopher Hooper)
like low

2858
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:16,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, that's that's
-

(Ellis Taylor)
done.

2859
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:20,000
(Luke Neverisky)
one shot. Yeah,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
HP. Yeah. And like

2860
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:24,000
(Tyram)
point. Well, Bards have a rough time when the
-

(Luke Neverisky)
but it's all good. As you do it,
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2861
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:28,000
(Tyram)
enemy has legendary resistance because bards do have a lot of I

2862
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:32,000
(Tyram)
instantly win uh spells in their repertoire, but
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2863
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:36,000
(Tyram)
the dragon can just eat them to a certain extent, you

2864
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:40,000
(Luke Neverisky)
Yeah, I realized that was gonna it was an uphill battle. So, I was like, "All right, I'm just
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah.

2865
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:44,000
(Tyram)
know. Yeah, probably more an instant win.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
going to play Healbot

2866
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:48,000
(Tyram)
Um things like Tasha's like autos Irresistible dance like

2867
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:52,000
(Tyram)
that, like those are all pretty much instant wins.
-

(Luke Neverisky)
instead.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2868
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:56,000
(Tyram)
But

2869
03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:00,000
(Tyram)
yeah. Oh, uh, what's it?

2870
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:04,000
(Tyram)
Um, the third level spell that does like a big illusion.

2871
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:08,000
(Tyram)
Um, no, it
-

(Ellis Taylor)
Oh yeah.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh,

2872
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:12,000
(Tyram)
like the I can't remember the name of it, but like

2873
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:16,000
(Tyram)
it basically like shuts everyone down for like it's like the

2874
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:20,000
(Tyram)
non-lethal fireball basically.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Mirage.

2875
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:24,000
(Tyram)
Um, that's it.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Oh, yeah.

2876
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:28,000
(Tyram)
Yeah, that's also basically an instant
-

(Luke Neverisky)
pattern. Mhm. That's a
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, right. That's an illusion spell, I

2877
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:32,000
(Luke Neverisky)
favorite.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
guess. Yeah, that one's given like so

2878
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:36,000
(Tyram)
win. Well, it's an instant
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yep.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
early, too. It's

2879
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:40,000
(Tyram)
win as long as it's okay for you to run away. If you have to actually kill it, it
-

(Luke Neverisky)
Yep.

2880
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:44,000
(Tyram)
gives you a free shot, but it doesn't do much more than
-

(Ellis Taylor)
basketball.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
crazy.

2881
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:48,000
(Tyram)
that.
-

(Christopher Hooper)
Yeah. Yeah.

2882
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:52,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Um, I thought it was I thought it was great.

2883
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:56,000
(Christopher Hooper)
Uh, I was happy that you like were still

2884
03:18:56,000 --> 03:19:00,000
(Christopher Hooper)
critical, Luke, in like getting Brew back up and getting the engines

2885
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:04,000
(Christopher Hooper)
going. Um, too,

2886
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:08,000

(Christopher Hooper)
Victor, um, what's going on with St. George

2933
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:16,000
