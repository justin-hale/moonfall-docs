description: "Conclusion of the racing conspiracy against Elspeth Cooper, featuring experimental D&D racing mechanics, increasingly elaborate sabotage, and the ultimate disgrace of a racing legend."
summary: "The six-racer conspiracy against Elspeth Cooper (Elspeth's past identity) reached its climax in the Greyport Speedway finale race. Using refined D&D racing mechanics, the conspirators employed red zones for illegal magic, VVS boost zones, and increasingly absurd sabotage attempts—including Wile E. Coyote painted tunnels, slow spells affecting allies, magic weapons, and strategic firebolts. Despite not winning the race, the frame job succeeded: Elspeth was disgraced and accused of using her brother's unregistered racing crystal, ending her 20+ year career. The session mixed high-speed tactical racing with comedy as every conspirator's schemes spiraled into chaos."

# Interlude XV: The Greyport Finale Race

## Session Overview

Continuing directly from [Interlude XIV](/sessions/interlude-14), this session concluded the flashback race conspiracy against **Elspeth Cooper** (Elspeth's previous identity). The experimental D&D racing mechanics were refined with action economy changes, red zones for magical abilities, and VVS (Vroom Vroom System) boost zones. The six conspirators—Verstap, Den Lin, Serge, Scotty Mac, Lancey Stroll, and Xugor—deployed increasingly chaotic sabotage attempts while racing three laps around Greyport Speedway. Though the race outcome was secondary, the conspiracy succeeded: Elspeth was accused of using her brother Zachary's unregistered racing crystal, ending her legendary career in disgrace.

## Pre-Race Recap: The Conspiracy

As established in Interlude XIV, **Tito Bonito** (racing circuit board president) assembled six racers to disgrace **Elspeth Cooper** within 24 hours. Her crime: voting against a unanimous board decision that would have brought "big money" into the sport. All team owners except Elspeth had agreed she must be removed.

**The Conspirators:**
- **Verstap** (Justin) - Dominant golden boy, sponsored by Infinity Internet
- **Den Lin** (Tyram) - Cartoonish villain with orphan coal mines and teleportation magic
- **Serge** (Ellis) - Desperate second-tier driver, career on the line
- **Scotty Mac** (Christopher) - Elspeth's best friend, torn by loyalty
- **Lancey Stroll** (Luke) - Rich elf with Christopher Walken voice, whiny and entitled  
- **Xugor** (Ali) - 7-foot orcish woman, quiet and methodical

**Pre-Race Sabotage Success:**
- Serge successfully planted Team Cooper t-shirt evidence in Verstap's sabotaged engine
- Xugor fed Elspeth poppy seed muffins (hoping for positive drug test)
- Den Lin's schemes all spectacularly failed (pineapple pizza scandal, hooker photos, etc.)
- Scotty placed a "nuclear option" rune under Elspeth's car to make it fly if needed
- Both Verstap and Elspeth were penalized to back of grid for discovered sabotage

**The Trump Card:**
Unknown to most conspirators, Elspeth's brother **Zachary Cooper** had already ensured her downfall by switching her registered racing crystal (their mother's Cooper crystal) for an unregistered family crystal.

## Refined Racing Mechanics

The DM adjusted the experimental racing system based on Interlude XIV feedback:

**Action Economy Changes:**
- Started with two generic actions per turn (move or ability)
- Mid-race switched to normal D&D action economy (action + bonus action)
- This allowed spellcasters to use bonus action spells while moving

**Movement System:**
- Roll d8 for base movement (in 5-foot squares)
- Can dash (use action to roll additional d8)
- Slow spell reduces movement die to d4 and limits to one action

**Special Zones:**
- **Blue Zones (VVS)** - Legal boost zones providing extra d4 movement
- **Red Zones** - Areas where officials can't see, allowing magical abilities without detection
- Only conspirators had maps showing these zones; Elspeth received standard map

**Passing & Combat:**
- When cars are adjacent at end of round, contested roll to determine position
- Attacks and spells possible in red zones
- Cars have 100 HP
- Damage represents mechanical/cosmetic damage, not instant disqualification

## The Race: Lap 1

### Opening Moves: The Separation

**Initiative Order (approximate):**
1. Den Lin (first)
2. Verstap  
3. Serge
4. Scotty Mac
5. Lancey Stroll
6. Xugor
7. Elspeth (NPC, back of grid)

**Den Lin's Painted Tunnel Scheme:**
- Den Lin deployed his pre-planned Wile E. Coyote sabotage
- Planted sign reading "SHORTCUT FOR ELSPETH ONLY" with arrow
- Sign pointed to painted tunnel on wall with "ELSPETH" written above it
- Hoped Elspeth would crash into the false tunnel
- Move forward: 2 spaces (engine restart after placing sign)

**Early Positioning:**
- Verstap, Scotty Mac, and Lancey all rolled double 8s (16 total movement)
- Front pack pulled significantly ahead
- Xugor, Serge, Den Lin, and Elspeth fell behind
- Clear separation between leaders and stragglers

### Serge's Strategic Sabotage

**Awe Foes Attempt:**
- Serge used Channel Divinity: Awe Foes (trying to frighten opponents)
- Targeted Den Lin, Verstap, and Elspeth
- DC 15 Wisdom save
- **All three saved** (frustrating moment for desperate Serge)
- Movement: 7 spaces

**Tactical Position:**
- Stayed in mid-pack
- Eyes on both Elspeth (primary target) and competitors
- Preserving resources for later red zone plays

### The Great Slow Spell Incident

**Xugor's Area Effect:**
- Xugor cast Slow spell affecting multiple cars
- Intended targets: Den Lin, Verstap, and others
- **Friendly fire**: Also affected teammate Verstap
- Effect: Reduces movement to d4, limits to one action, disadvantage on attacks
- DC 17 Wisdom save

**Saves:**
- Verstap: Saved (16, then 18 on second slow)
- Scotty Mac: Failed (slowed)
- Serge: Saved (but slowed again later)
- Lancey: Immune (already "naturally slow")
- Den Lin: Failed (slowed)

**Chaos:**
- Slow spell became recurring theme
- Multiple conspirators affected their own allies
- "Are you guys cheating?" became running joke
- Players debated whether slowed = frightened (different effects)

### Scotty Mac's Moral Crisis

**The Honest Racer:**
- Scotty attempted misty step teleportation but couldn't take his car
- Read Den Lin's "Shortcut for Elspeth Only" sign
- As "honest racer," honorably avoided the "designated" shortcut
- Clear internal conflict: wants to win, feels guilty about cheating

**Aging Rapidly:**
- Running gag: Scotty aging throughout the race
- Started at 40-50, by end might die of old age
- "Poor Scotty Mac" sympathy despite being conspirator
- Double-rolled sixes: "One for the money, two for the double eights!"

### Lancey Stroll: The Polymorph Attempt

**Turn Scotty Into a Sheep:**
- Lancey cast Polymorph on Scotty Mac in visible zone
- Attempted to turn him into a sheep mid-race
- Scotty rolled **18 Wisdom save** (barely passed)
- Would have created sheep covered in sponsorship stickers
- Discussed: Would it be Dumb & Dumber van-dog but as sheep-car?

**Christopher Walken Energy:**
- "I'm gonna turn him into a SHEEP"
- Whiny rich boy attempting ridiculous sabotage
- Father owns his team (privilege throughout)
- Minimal effectiveness but high entertainment value

### Verstap's Position & Slow Escape

**Golden Boy Status:**
- Started with movement penalties (back of grid due to sabotage discovery)
- Used misty step to teleport forward (60 ft bonus action)
- Escaped multiple slow spells through high Wisdom saves
- Movement rolls consistently high (9-12 spaces)

**Avoiding Conflict:**
- Verstap mostly focused on racing to win
- Didn't engage in active sabotage during Lap 1
- Benefited from being sponsored golden boy
- Officials gave him benefit of doubt on earlier sabotage accusations

## The Race: Mid-Laps

### Den Lin's Elaborate Scheming Continues

**Free Treats for Dwarves Trap:**
- As Den Lin passed the pit area, signaled his "minions"
- They set up sign: "FREE TREATS FOR DWARVES"
- Display included keg of booze, beef jerky, "things dwarves like"
- All placed on a **catapult**
- If target stepped out for treats, catapult would launch them

**Execution:**
- Pre-planned during 24-hour sabotage window
- Aimed at Elspeth and Scotty (both dwarves)
- Classic Wile E. Coyote energy
- Movement: 10 spaces

**Den Lin's Slow Suffering:**
- Constantly affected by Xugor's slow spells
- Could only move d4 instead of d8
- "What level of autism made that happen?" (regarding complex engine builds)
- Still teleported using orphan soul power when possible

### Serge's Desperation Play: The Insurance Scam

**Magic Weapon Buff:**
- Serge cast Magic Weapon on his car as bonus action
- Made the entire vehicle a +1 magical weapon
- Plan: Provoke "accident" with Elspeth to frame her

**The Break Check Maneuver:**
- Moved into red zone ahead of Elspeth
- Purposefully slowed down (chose not to take full movement)
- **Readied action**: When Elspeth passes, jerk car to look like she rear-ended him
- "Oh my neck! Oh my back! Oh my neck and my back!"

**The Collision:**
- Attack roll: 19 + 1 = **20** (hit)
- Elspeth's Perception: 17 (failed to avoid)
- Damage: 5 (unarmed strike damage, making it "look real")
- **Elspeth took 16 HP damage** (bumper dragging behind)
- **Serge lost 43 HP** (limping car)

**Commentary:**
- "She hit me! They'll believe you!"
- Serge already limping from earlier damage
- Made it look extremely obvious Elspeth rammed him
- Classic insurance fraud energy translated to racing

### Xugor's Red Zone Artillery

**Parked in Red Zone:**
- Xugor strategically stopped moving
- Positioned in zone where officials couldn't see
- Focus: Frame Elspeth rather than win race

**Firebolt Bombardment:**
- Shot Serge with firebolt for 12 damage
- Each firebolt had post-it note saying "From Elspeth"
- Elspeth was actually behind Xugor at the time
- Obviously not from Elspeth, but created "evidence"

**Second Casting:**
- Another firebolt at Serge for 9 damage
- "I'm shooting from a hidden location. No one knows it's me."
- Choosing not to affect Elspeth directly ("she's my friend")
- Strategic sacrifice: Not racing to win, ensuring frame job success

### The Slow Spell Wars

**Recurring Slow Effects:**
- Xugor cast Slow multiple times
- Each casting affected 4-6 cars in area
- Verstap: Saved repeatedly (+8 Wisdom)
- Scotty Mac: Slowed, then saved later
- Den Lin: Perpetually slowed
- Serge: Slowed, then saved with natural 25

**Action Economy Confusion:**
- "If you're slowed, can you take bonus actions?"
- Slowed = one action, half speed, d4 movement
- Frightened = different effect (disadvantage, can't move toward source)
- Both could stack simultaneously

**Expeditious Retreat Counter:**
- Xugor cast Expeditious Retreat to compensate
- "Whoever's slowed is no longer slowed"
- Used multiple bonus actions for extra movement
- Balanced offensive debuffs with personal mobility

### Verstap vs. Scotty Mac: The Friendship Contests

**Adjacent Racing:**
- Verstap and Scotty repeatedly ended turns adjacent
- Required contested rolls to determine passing position
- Scotty rolled **14**, Lancey rolled **less than 14**
- Verstap rolled **15**, Scotty rolled **11**

**Scotty's Decline:**
- "Well, old Scotty here only rolled a six. Not my best I've ever had."
- Still affected by slow spell: "If I'm slowed and rolled a six, did I actually roll a three?"
- Corrected: Should roll d4 when slowed, not d8 then halve
- Moved backward 3 spaces at one point (following slow rules strictly)

**"Honest Racer" Roleplay:**
- Scotty consistently played as conflicted
- "I play by the rules" even while actively cheating
- Called his "Papy" (father/team owner) in distress
- Win watching from home, training to take his seat

## The Race: Final Lap & Conclusion

### The Question of Victory

**Racing Became Secondary:**
- Primary goal: Frame Elspeth for cheating
- Actual race winner less important than conspiracy success
- Multiple racers stopped racing to focus on sabotage

**Likely Finishing Positions (approximate):**
1. Verstap or Xugor (front runners)
2. Den Lin (teleportation advantage despite slow)
3. Scotty Mac (elderly but determined)
4. Serge (damaged but functional)
5. Lancey (naturally slow despite privilege)
6. Elspeth (sabotaged, accused, penalized)

**Why Victory Didn't Matter:**
- Xugor literally parked to shoot Elspeth
- Serge stopped to create collision evidence
- Den Lin focused on elaborate traps
- Scotty conflicted about competing
- Winning would draw attention; better to frame Elspeth and finish mid-pack

### The Post-Race Revelation

**Tito's Announcement:**
- Race officials investigated Elspeth's car
- Found multiple "irregularities" from sabotage
- Discovered the damning evidence: **Wrong crystal**

**The Crystal Conspiracy:**
- Elspeth's registered crystal: Cooper family crystal (her mother's)
- Crystal in her car: Different Cooper family crystal
- Brother **Zachary Cooper** had switched them
- Using unregistered crystal = definite cheating, grounds for ban

**Elspeth's Reaction:**
- Dramatically left the paddock
- "Smells. Got it." (Den Lin's delayed punchline satisfaction)
- No defense possible against crystal evidence
- 20+ year career ended in disgrace

**The Conspirators' "Victory":**
- Tito: "We did it everyone! Congratulations!"
- Most conspirators felt terrible
- Scotty Mac: "I feel terrible. I've got to call my Papy."
- Lancey: "I guess I'm calling my daddy."
- Den Lin walked out satisfied
- Xugor called her lawyer

### Ongoing Accusations

The DM revealed Ally had a **list of everything Elspeth has been accused of:**

**Known Accusations:**
1. Using unregistered crystal (Zachary's switch)
2. Chassis filing (Xugor's pre-race sabotage, caught)
3. Crystal tampering (Serge's planted Team Cooper shirt evidence)
4. Rear-ending Serge (insurance scam collision)
5. Shooting firebolt at Serge (Xugor's post-it note frame job)
6. Pineapple pizza scandal (Den Lin's failed attempt)
7. Hooker association (Den Lin's rave photos)
8. Drug test concerns (Xugor's poppy seed muffins)

**Frame Job Success:**
- Even without the crystal switch, mountain of circumstantial evidence
- Testimony from six conspirators
- Video evidence of car damage
- Zachary's betrayal ensured results regardless

**Quote:** *"Even if we had done nothing, Zachary kind of had her from the start."*

## Character Moments & Development

### Serge: Career Desperation

**Second-Tier Racer Mentality:**
- Only saboteur who successfully executed plan (Verstap's engine tampering pre-race)
- Insurance fraud collision perfectly executed
- Took significant damage (43 HP) to frame Elspeth
- "I might lose a job if he [Verstap] wins"

**Moral Calculation:**
- Knew framing Elspeth was wrong
- Career survival overrode ethics
- "Yes, but I might get bumped if he wins"
- Desperate people do desperate things

### Scotty Mac: Friendship Betrayed

**The "Honest Racer":**
- Best friends with Elspeth for decades
- Given nuclear option rune (make her car fly = obvious cheating)
- Tried to race honestly despite conspiracy
- "Come on, Lancey. Scotty needs [to win]."

**Moral Weight:**
- Clearly aging rapidly (visual metaphor for guilt)
- "This race feels like it's aged me a lot"
- Called Papy afterward: "I can't believe I had to go through with this"
- Torn between family obligation and friendship

**The Prophecy:**
- Earlier joke: Scotty might die of old age during race
- By end, genuinely seemed broken by betrayal
- Daughter Win waiting to take his seat (legacy pressure)

### Xugor: The Technical Conspirator

**Strategic Saboteur:**
- Sacrificed race victory to ensure frame job
- Parked in red zone for optimal firing position
- Pre-planned dwarf catapult trap
- Slow spells controlled the field

**Professional Approach:**
- Quiet, methodical, effective
- "I run for a nonprofit" (ironically, while sabotaging)
- Called lawyer immediately after (prepared for consequences)
- Daughter of ex-KGB equivalent (learned from the best)

### Den Lin: Wile E. Coyote Personified

**Cartoon Villain Energy:**
- Painted tunnel with "ELSPETH" sign
- Free treats catapult trap
- Pineapple pizza scandal
- "You meddling orphans!" while teleporting

**Consistent Failure:**
- Every pre-race scheme failed spectacularly
- Constantly slowed by Xugor's spells
- Still satisfied by overall conspiracy success
- Walked out without regret: "f****** got her ass"

### Verstap: The Golden Boy

**Minimal Involvement:**
- Focused on actually racing
- High Wisdom saves avoided most debuffs
- Benefited from system despite being framed too
- Officials believed his sabotage was Elspeth's fault

**Privilege in Action:**
- Sponsorships: Infinity Internet, Sun Bills, Blue Ox
- Team resources superior to others
- "I'm the golden boy of the race"
- Could afford to just race and let others do dirty work

### Lancey Stroll: Christopher Walken Chaos

**Rich Kid Problems:**
- Father owns team (ultimate safety net)
- Attempted to polymorph Scotty into sheep
- Whiny throughout: "apparently not" (deadpan)
- Banking info on post-it notes (projection of incompetence)

**Minimal Competence:**
- Movement solid but no tactical sense
- Cloud of daggers prepared but never deployed
- Called "daddy" after conspiracy success
- Embodied entitled mediocrity

## Racing Mechanics: Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Action Economy Flexibility:**
- Switching to normal action economy mid-race allowed for more tactical play
- Bonus action spells (misty step, expeditious retreat) added depth
- Players adapted quickly to new system

**Red Zones & VVS:**
- Created strategic decision points
- Red zones justified magic use narratively
- VVS zones would have mattered more in closer race
- Secret map knowledge gave conspirators advantage

**HP & Damage System:**
- 100 HP prevented instant eliminations
- Damage represented cosmetic/mechanical issues
- Allowed aggressive tactics without ending race too quickly
- Collision and attack rolls made sense

### Areas for Improvement

**VVS Zone Usage:**
- Barely used because leaders never needed them
- Only matter when cars are closely packed
- Should be more frequent or provide bigger bonus
- "If I'm next to somebody, I can use VVS?" confusion

**Passing Mechanics:**
- Contested rolls when adjacent worked well
- Timing (end of round) sometimes unclear
- "Do we contest every turn or just when trying to pass?"

**Movement Variance:**
- D8 movement created huge variance (1 vs 8 = 35 feet difference)
- Some racers consistently rolled low (Scotty's decline)
- Others rolled high (Verstap's dominance)
- Luck determined outcomes more than strategy

**Speed Separation:**
- Leaders quickly separated from stragglers
- Den Lin's teleport only way to stay competitive
- Made interactions between front/back impossible
- More catch-up mechanics needed

## Comedy Highlights

### The Running Gags

**Scotty's Rapid Aging:**
- Started 40-50 years old
- Jokes about Benjamin Button in reverse

- "Disney's very litigious"
- "Black bag with Mickey Mouse ears"
- "Dollywood has bear ears that look like Minnie Mouse ears"

### The Best Moments

- The irony of conspirators accusing each other

**Xugor's Shooting Gallery:**
- Parked car in red zone
- Systematically firebombing Serge
- "Post-it notes saying 'From Elspeth'"

- "I didn't think you would break it quite this much"
- "I'm like a kindergarten teacher that has lost control of the classroom"
- Oscillated between fun and overwhelmed

**The Rules Evolution:**

- Players consistently asking "Can we do this? Can we do this?"
- Ally adapting on the fly

**Genuine Question:**
- "Ally, are you really not having a good time?"
- Tyram: "I legit will feel terrible if you're just like miserable right now"
- Response: "It was a great session and we did it"
- Non-answer suggested mixed feelings

### The Conspiracy Guilt

**Recurring Theme:**
- Most conspirators felt bad
- "For someone who set this up where we're supposed to be trying to hurt you, you were getting offended a lot"
- "You gave us one job and we're doing it"
- Guilt despite following assignment

**Scotty Mac's Burden:**
- Most sympathetic conspirator
- Best friend betraying best friend
- "I feel terrible"
- Called Papy in distress

**Xugor's Calculation:**
- "I run for a nonprofit" (while shooting fireballs)
- Strategic rather than emotional
- Still called lawyer afterward

### DM's Vision vs. Reality

**Christopher's Check-In:**
- "Ally, what was your vision?"
- "Well, it doesn't really matter. It's already happened."
- "That was good. We ended up accusing her and it's good. We did it."
- Resigned acceptance of chaos

**The Success:**
- Goal achieved: Elspeth disgraced
- Crystal evidence ensured failure
- Conspiracy successful despite shenanigans
- Players had fun destroying PC's backstory

## Ongoing Plot Threads

1. **Elspeth's Transformation:** How does this disgraced racer become adventurer Elspeth? When does she switch identities?

2. **Zachary's Betrayal:** Brother's conspiracy with Tito—what does he gain? Does he get Elspeth's seat?

3. **The Cooper Crystals:** Two family crystals exist—what happened to the registered one? Why does the family have two?

4. **Scotty Mac's Redemption:** Does he ever tell Elspeth the truth? Seek forgiveness?

5. **Tito's Endgame:** What was the "big money" vote Elspeth opposed? How does her removal benefit the circuit?

6. **Granddaughter Olivia:** Retired detective mentioned in Interlude XIV—does she investigate the conspiracy? Learn the truth?

7. **The Other Conspirators:** Do any of them face consequences? Regret their actions?

8. **Current Timeline Connection:** Does the main party know about Elspeth's racing past?

9. **The Nuclear Option Rune:** Was Scotty's flying car rune ever discovered? Is it still under her car?

10. **Poppy Seed Drug Test:** Did Xugor's muffin plan actually work? Was there a positive test?

11. **Team Cooper:** What happened to Elspeth's loyal pit crew after her ban? Her team ownership?

12. **Racing Crystal Mechanics:** How do these magical racing engines work? Are they family heirlooms?

## Key Revelations

1. **Elspeth's Racing Career:** 20+ years as legendary racer, team owner, board member, and principled voice against corruption

2. **Brother's Ultimate Betrayal:** Zachary Cooper worked with Tito Bonito to switch racing crystals, ensuring sister's downfall regardless of other schemes

3. **Conspiracy Overkill:** Six racers' elaborate sabotage was unnecessary—Zachary's crystal switch alone would have ended her career

4. **Moral Cost:** Every conspirator except Den Lin showed guilt, especially Scotty Mac who betrayed decades-long friendship

5. **Systemic Corruption:** The racing circuit board, team owners, and officials all coordinated to remove Elspeth for opposing "big money" interests

6. **The Frame Job's Scope:** Multiple accusations ensured no defense possible—crystal evidence, collision damage, witness testimony, planted evidence

7. **Cooper Family Crystals:** Two family racing crystals exist with different registrations—suggests complex family history and inheritance

8. **Identity Transformation Setup:** This disgrace likely triggers Elspeth's transition to Elspeth the adventurer—complete life change
