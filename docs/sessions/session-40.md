## A Night at the Dragon's Hide

The session opens with the party settling into their accommodations at the Order of St. George's headquarters. Each member has their own nightly routine:

**[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)** demonstrates her meticulous nature—laying out clothes perfectly folded, ensuring blankets are symmetrical, lighting incense, and performing quiet meditation and affirmations before bed.

**[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** practices nighttime tai chi to calm his nerves from the rooftop chase, then pops into his shell atop the bed like a turtle on a dog bed.

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** makes his nightly call to Naomi via sending stone, updating her on the eventful day—finding his old friend alive only to nearly watch him die again in a bakery explosion.

### Overheard in the Night

[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana) and [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) struggle to sleep through the constant activity in the headquarters. Through the walls, they overhear:

- Two goblins arguing—one an elderly man weeping about a dragon attack that destroyed their village in the south, the other throwing gasoline on the emotional fire
- Knights discussing someone at the harbor preparing a ship to explore a site in the sea
- The general bustle of an organization constantly preparing for battle

## Morning Briefing

After a restful long rest (for most), the party gathers in the mess hall for breakfast. They notice people in varying states of wellness—many bearing burn marks and other injuries from dragon encounters.

**Commander Tannondel** approaches:

> "Ah, you are awake. Great. I'd like to brief you on the dragon orb you've taken to Graeme Goth—I believe your orb's name is Rain Goth—and we'd like to talk about next steps. I believe you're interested in the rebinding ritual, which we have a plan for, and we'd love your help."

### Silas's Morning Call

[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana) scoots up to [Silas](/player-characters/silas) at breakfast:

> **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana):** "So, did you have a visitor last night? I heard you talking."

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "I was making a stone call... to Naomi."

> **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana):** "She's your love interest. That's cool. So cute."

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "A weird way to phrase it, but yes."

[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) arrives with bags of bagels and donuts, catching the end of the conversation.

> **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia):** "Hey, are you still talking to Naomi?"

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "You guys don't hear Silas talking to Naomi like every night? Sometimes he doesn't even call her. Sometimes he just talks to himself about her."

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "Who would I be trying to impress? Bru?"

## The Commander's Office

The party enters Commander Tannondel's office, finding walls covered with paper rubbings, maps, and scripts in multiple languages—Dwarven, Elven, and others they don't recognize.

### Ohma's Discovery

[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma), reading Aquan, discovers a crucial piece of the puzzle. Rolling a natural 20 on his history check (30 total), he pieces together information from the ancient stone carvings:

**The Aquan Holy Site:**
- An ancient civilization, later called the Aquans because their carvings were found underwater, once lived on what is now the ocean floor
- They carved in stone because ink washes away underwater
- When the original "shattering" event occurred, most were boiled alive, but those on the far side of the continent survived
- Their texts describe a sacred site near mountains—now completely submerged as sea levels rose

**The Ritual Site's Significance:**
- Different civilizations called it different things: The Aquans called it a "rift site," the Dwarves called it a "place of balancing"
- This location has a powerful metaphysical connection
- When Luna fell, something about this site served as a "soft landing," preventing her from shattering herself and the planet

**Current Situation:**
- Reports describe a hole in the ocean where coral has been exposed to air
- The site remains dry despite being in the middle of the sea
- People can walk along Luna's body
- Dragons patrol the area, destroying anyone who approaches

### The Order's Plan

Commander Tannondel explains:

> "We believe we have the resources to get to the ritual rebinding site and rebind the dragon within the orb. But there's more to it. We're afraid there's more than one orb—one that we haven't been able to track. We think by instrumenting around the rebinding ritual, we'll be able to get a signal to the other orbs and find them. Find how many there are and where they might be."

She also reveals her surprise that [Silas](/player-characters/silas) could carry the orb without being corrupted:

> "I'm quite frankly surprised you were able, under your own will, to bring it towards us. Quite a statement of your character."

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "Yeah, that's definitely never happened, right, Silas?"

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "We're just really good guys, I guess."

[Silas](/player-characters/silas) hands over Helga's journals for the Order's research, prompting an excited response from Tannondel.

## Reunion with Theirsander

[Silas](/player-characters/silas) and [Bru](/player-characters/bru) visit Theirsander in the medical bay, finding him with oatmeal and apple juice, just woken up.

[Bru](/player-characters/bru) immediately jumps on him:

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "I left you in bed this whole time! Never do this to me again!"

### Theirsander's Story

Theirsander recounts his survival:

> "They stabbed me, but they never checked to make sure I was actually dead. When I woke up, my dead sister was next to me. I crawled out into a local coffee shop where there was a beautiful man, and he healed me. He told me, 'You're gonna use this sacrifice to change the world, and you're going to hunt dragons.' And that's what I did. Never saw him again."

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "That is a pretty ominous encounter. A strange thing to say to someone."

### The Flour Network

Theirsander, still recovering from his concussion, has built a new life at the bakery:

> **Theirsander:** "I've got a few leads through the bakery. There's this whole flour network I've been figuring out. There's some real money to be made. If y'all are scam for cash, we got some business going on."

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "I'm sorry, are you offering us a job in the baked goods industry right now?"

> **Theirsander:** "It's not a job in the baked goods business. It's THE job. The big dough payday. You know what I'm talking about."

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "No, we literally don't know what you're talking about."

Despite his head injury-induced fixation on flour, Theirsander explains he's found something with the Order—safety, routine, and friends who don't require crime to hang out.

> **Theirsander:** "Y'all were the best friends I'll ever have. Nothing bonds you like a heist mission. But when you're not doing heists, it's cool to just make some bread with people."

[Bru](/player-characters/bru) pulls out a piece of paper and writes "Operation Cogenstein" at the top.

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "It's nothing. Bru likes to scribble."

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "It's anti-bread propaganda. We hate gluten."

## The Armory

Commander Tannondel directs them to the Order's armory, where they can take any common or uncommon equipment they need.

**Equipment Acquired:**
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia):** Shield +1 with dragon imagery
- **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana):** Shortbow +1
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** Sentinel Shield (advantage on initiative and perception)
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma):** Oil casks and a Potion of Growth

As they browse, a perception check reveals something unusual—a buzzing sound that grows into a roar as a **horde of 100 goblins** floods into the room, all preparing for deployment.

[Bru](/player-characters/bru) rolls a 14 on his history check and recognizes about 14 of them—including his brother **Thru**, someone from his bowling team, several first and second cousins, and at least one guy who owes him money.

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "I'll see him at the family barbecue. Hey, you guys can come. You're cool enough for it."

## Meeting Bafael

At the docks, the party spots [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)'s **monk brother Bafael** (also known as "Rap Sheet" for his prankster ways at the monastery) surrounded by dragon knights, speaking with a ship captain.

### The Forced Arrangement

Captain Buckle, owner of a fishing vessel, has been conscripted for the expedition:

> **Bafael:** "You will have no choice, but we will pay you for your time."

> **Captain Buckle:** "And you said I didn't really have a choice about this, right?"

> **Bafael:** "That is right."

### Brothers Reunited

> **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma):** "Hey, Rap Sheet, is that you?"

> **Bafael:** "What are you doing here?"

> **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma):** "I could be asking you the same. Did I overhear correctly? Are you in charge of these men?"

> **Bafael:** "Of course. This was my scheme."

## The Disturbing Truth

Bafael pulls [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) aside for a private conversation, and [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) relays everything through [Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s psychic network in real-time.

### The Order's True Agenda

> **Bafael:** "These people—I am not sure that they align with what we should align with. They are obsessed with killing dragons. But you know the legend of Luna and the dragon god of fire—they were together. I have joined with them to find what happened to Luna, but I do not know if we should work with them beyond that."

Then the bombshell:

> **Bafael:** "They are working on a weapon. The weapon that killed and struck our god. They hope to unleash it on Noraxis. And this Order of St. George is working with the Eldoran Empire from their moon base."

[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) immediately broadcasts to the party:

> "Bafael has just told me that this group of dragon warriors is working directly with Eldoran, and they are trying to make the moon weapon that struck down Luna something to be used again."

### Moral Complexity

> **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma):** "I find that I must make a choice between saving everything or sticking to my own principles. What am I if everything were to fall to darkness?"

> **Bafael:** "I hope you know. Do you know the ends that they hope to make? It doesn't stop with the rebinding ritual."

## Strategic Discussion

The party ducks into an alley to process this information.

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "Man, just once—just one goddamn time—I want us to find a group of people who are ostensibly trying to help us, and for them to not end up being a bunch of assholes."

### Threading the Needle

The party weighs their options:
- **Can't help Eldoran:** They're doing "cosmological murder" and genocide
- **Can't abandon the ritual:** The galaxy-eating dragon in the orb is still a threat
- **Won't side with Iron Claws:** Under any circumstances
- **Need an exit strategy:** Once the ritual is complete, they can't hand over information about other orbs

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "Regardless of allegiances and long-term plans, we still need to do this ritual for the orb. None of the rest of this matters if this galaxy-eating dragon escapes."

> **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma):** "I believe we know a decision will be made very soon about what comes next once this ritual is complete."

### Calling Victor

[Bru](/player-characters/bru) pulls out an ostentatiously decorated sending stone covered in Victor's logos and contacts their eccentric ally:

> **Victor:** "Hello? Who is this?"

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "Hey, Victor, buddy. Old pal. We're in the neighborhood."

> **Victor:** "What are you wearing?"

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "Thirteen wires. One for every organization."

Victor is at the zoo ("I love the zoo. I've got a membership.") and needs a dragon egg for his "experiment"—which he describes as making "the best omelette."

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "It's very important that you stay at the zoo and do not leave until I get there. Bad things could happen to you."

> **Victor:** "But I have dinner plans."

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "If you go to those dinner plans, you're putting your life at risk."

> **Victor:** "Okay. It was good knowing you. I love you, bro. Take care."

## Setting Sail

The party boards Captain Buckle's vessel, which must row out of the harbor ("It's a no-wake zone," the DM insists) before engaging its motor.

### The Expedition Force

On board:
- **Bafael** and the **Commander** (in bone wings armor with a greatsword)
- **Two knights**
- **Ten aspiring squires** in St. George uniforms
- **Ten hired hands**
- **Captain Buckle's crew** (10-20)
- **The party**

### Questioning the Knights

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "How exactly are you guys going to deal with the dragons here?"

> **Knight:** "Well, we'll probably shoot them. Get a couple grappling hooks in them, send a couple people up top, cut their head off, then use the grappling hooks to pull their carcass onto the boat and carve them right up."

> **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia):** "Interesting. What do you do with them?"

> **Knight:** "Sell the hide to armorers, collect bones for more armor, and if we have enough skeleton left, we'll probably open another tavern. The taverns are really popular with bachelor parties. That's honestly one of the main economic vehicles for our organization."

> **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia):** "I mean, it is strong branding."

### Bafael's Final Warning

[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) speaks privately with Bafael once more:

> **Bafael:** "Even though our aims are not the same as theirs, I believe they are men of honor. They believe what they are doing, and they believe we are aligned with them. As long as we are on their side, they will protect us. But eventually, we will have to choose to be their enemy."

> **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma):** "I too have fears of what will happen. I would suggest that you watch your back. While these people may seem honorable, we have seen what Eldoran can do."

## Preparing for the Ritual

As night falls and the ship approaches dragon territory, Bafael gathers the party:

> **Bafael:** "We should talk about the ritual. Do you know what you must do? I believe we will all have to give our blood freely. Are you ready?"

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "How much blood are we talking? Like prick our fingers, or bleed out an unsettling amount?"

> **Bafael:** "I don't know. I've never done this before. I have already collected the violescent spheres and the salt. And we know the dragon name, right? Whoever holds Rain Goth must be the one to speak the name. But I do not know what will happen."

> **Bafael:** "Silas, is it? Will you be ready to do this? I think she will seek to challenge you. Challenge your will, your mind. Are you the best suited?"

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "Yeah. I get a little help from my friends, and that does make it easier."

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "You get by with a little help from your friends."

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "I do get by with a little help from my friends."
