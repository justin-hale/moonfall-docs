## Picking Up the Pieces

The session opens with a recap of the previous events: the party's conversation with [Bafael](/npcs/bafael), the arm wrestling distraction that covered their sensor relay sabotage, the descent to Luna's crash site, and the successful rebinding ritual that resealed the dragon orb. The last thing they heard was the shout from above: "We got a live one!"—ropes firing into the air to catch an **adult blue dragon** circling overhead.

The party is 300 feet below the ocean surface, standing on the dry seabed at Luna's crash site. Above them, the Order of St. George's ship is under attack.

## Escape from the Ocean Floor

### Getting Up

The party scrambles to reach the surface. [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) immediately summons **Bob** and prepares to launch skyward, though her perception check (a dismal **5**) leaves her nearly blind to the chaos above—she can barely make out an anchor dropping from the ship.

[Silas](/player-characters/silas) uses his **Cloak of Arachneia** to spider-climb onto [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s back, rolling a **19 DEX save** (DC 16) to reach her before she launches.

[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) and [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)—both wearing **life vests** from their earlier insistence on safety equipment—plan to float up through the water wall.

### First Breath Weapon

Before anyone can escape, the dragon unleashes its **lightning breath** from above. DEX saves against DC 19:

- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** 24 — uses **Evasion** to take zero damage
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia):** 22 — takes half (15 lightning)
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth):** 14 — takes full **30 lightning damage**
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** and **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana):** Both save

[Bru](/player-characters/bru) takes a creative approach—using his **force ballista cannon** to propel himself upward through the water wall. An **Arcana check of 23** sends him rocketing past the life-vest crew, blasting through the surface like a cannonball.

## Dragon Combat on the Waves

### Taking the Fight to the Dragon

**Initiative:** [Bru](/player-characters/bru) rolls **21** with his Sentinel Shield advantage. [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) swaps to go first.

[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) teleports directly onto the dragon's back using **Bob's 60-foot Fey Step**, landing astride the beast mid-flight. She activates **Channel Divinity: Abjure Foe** and attacks:

- First swing: 10 (miss) → burns a **Lucky point** to reroll → **27** (hit) — deals **21 damage** with Shining Smite
- Second attack with advantage: **26** (hit) — **12 more damage**

She attempts to **Topple** the dragon, but it makes its CON save.

> **Christopher (DM):** "You are standing on top of this dragon and you strike down on its back... blue blood spills out from over you, but they are not toppled."

### The Dragon Dives

The dragon plunges **50 feet underwater**, dragging [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) and [Silas](/player-characters/silas) with it. Players must hold their breath—rounds equal to their CON modifier. [Silas](/player-characters/silas) with a CON modifier of **0** is in immediate danger of drowning.

[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) rolls **athletics 27** to hold on. [Silas](/player-characters/silas) rolls **14** (fail, DC 16) but burns a **psychic die** to boost it to **22**—just enough to hang on for one crucial round.

### Silas's Escape

[Silas](/player-characters/silas) materializes a psychic blade and strikes underwater: **20 to hit** (boosted with Homing Strikes), dealing **25 psychic damage** with sneak attack. Then, in a brilliantly desperate move, he throws a psychic dagger toward the surface and **teleports out of the water** using his Soulknife ability.

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** (telepathically to [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)): "I am no good in water. Good luck. Bye."

The dragon retaliates against [Silas](/player-characters/silas) before he escapes—rolling **30 to hit** for 19 damage, halved to **10** by **Uncanny Dodge**.

[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) wisely releases her grip rather than be dragged deeper.

## Defending the Ship

### Brew's Desperate Gambit

[Bru](/player-characters/bru) uses his cannon to blast himself onto the boat (Arcana **18**) and telepathically warns the party:

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "The dragon's totally gonna come back and go through the bottom of this boat. We got to get out of here."

In a stroke of artificer ingenuity, he casts **Enlarge** on the entire boat—making it bigger, sturdier, and granting advantage on structural strength checks. The ship stretches and groans as everything aboard scales up.

### The Second Breath Weapon

The dragon circles back and unleashes another lightning blast. **69 lightning damage** (34 on a successful save, DC 19).

The results are devastating:
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** Fails — drops to **0 HP**
- **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana):** Fails — drops to **0 HP**
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia):** Saves (rolled exactly 19) — takes 34, still standing at 47 HP
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth):** Fine at 18 HP

[Bru](/player-characters/bru) makes a death saving throw: rolls a **7**, but [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s **Aura of Devotion** adds **+3** to saves within 10 feet—turning it into a **10**. Success.

> **Justin ([Bru](/player-characters/bru)):** "I haven't even had a chance to try anything. I got up and I'm back down."

### Turning the Tide

[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) casts **Aid** at 3rd level on [Leliana](/player-characters/leliana) and [Bru](/player-characters/bru), granting **+10 to both max and current HP**—bringing both back to consciousness from 30 feet away without even needing line of sight.

[Silas](/player-characters/silas) spider-climbs the side of the boat and unloads psychic daggers:
- First dagger: **22 to hit** — 6 damage
- Second dagger with sneak attack: **19 to hit** — **31 total damage**

The dragon slams [Silas](/player-characters/silas) into the hull in retaliation before diving deep and going **invisible**.

### Leliana's Gamble

[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana) attempts **Polymorph** on the dragon (Wisdom DC 17), but the dragon burns a **Legendary Resistance** to shrug it off. The failed concentration swap drops her Fly spell—she falls 5 feet to the deck.

She recovers with a 4th-level **Cure Wounds**, rolling spectacularly to heal **50 HP**.

> **Luke ([Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)):** "I'm gonna risk it for a biscuit here."

### The Third Breath Weapon

The dragon fires lightning **through the bottom of the ship**. [Bru](/player-characters/bru) takes **49 lightning damage** and goes down to **0 HP again**. [Leliana](/player-characters/leliana), at only 6 HP, also drops.

## Fixing the Ship

### Elspeth Takes the Helm

[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth) finds the **wheelhouse** and discovers a key left in the ignition. She starts the engines—one of the two is running. Through the radio, she picks up chatter from the fleet:

> **Radio:** "There's more dragons coming in from the south. Prepare."

She relays everything to the party via [Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s psychic phone.

### Brew MacGyvers the Engine

[Bru](/player-characters/bru), revived by [Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)'s **Healing Word** (23 HP), stumbles to the engine room. His **passive perception of 18** immediately identifies the problem: the left engine is smashed, hull dents blocking the gears.

He needs an **Arcana DC 20** to fix it. With [Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)'s **Bardic Inspiration (d8)** and heroic inspiration, he rolls: **19 + 3 (bardic) + 8 (Arcana mod) = 30**.

> **Justin ([Bru](/player-characters/bru)):** "We're going to buff it out first. We're going to hammer those back out. We're going to replace any of the bits and bobs that need to be replaced. We got rubber bands. We got some stuff. We're going to MacGyver s*** out of this."

The engine backfires—**8 bludgeoning damage** (halved on a DEX save)—but it's running. Both engines are online. The ship lurches forward.

## Radio Deception

### "Big Sinks" on the Air

[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth) takes on the callsign **"Big Sinks"** and begins communicating with the fleet. HQ keeps pressing about the orb's status:

> **HQ:** "What's the status of the orb?"

The party decides to lie. [Silas](/player-characters/silas) gets on the radio with a **Deception check of 28** (his minimum is 21 with Reliable Talent) and tells HQ the orb fell into the ocean during the dragon attack.

### The Fate of Jenkins

Through the radio, they hear increasingly desperate transmissions from **Jenkins**, the sole survivor of a sinking ship 40 minutes away. He radios personal messages—asking someone to tell his sister Tiana he'll miss her wedding. The party can't reach him in time.

Jenkins doesn't make it.

Meanwhile, **Leroy's** ship reports killing a white dragon and a copper dragon—2.5 dragons total for their crew.

## A Sending Stone for Luna

As the ship prepares to leave, [Silas](/player-characters/silas) has a crucial idea:

> **[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** "If we're going to book it, do we want to like throw a sending stone down to Luna to see if we can talk to her through it?"

The party coordinates a throw from the ship's deck down to Luna's crash site, 300 feet below. A tag-team **athletics check of 28** sends Victor's sending stone arcing down with "pro baseball form," landing right next to the ritual site.

Now they can communicate with Luna through Victor's paired stone—once they find Victor.

## The Long Sail Home

### Captain Buckle Emerges

The 12-hour journey back to Greyport provides a **long rest**. When [Captain Buckle](/npcs/captain-buckle) finally emerges from his quarters—having hidden there the entire battle—he's confused by his enlarged ship.

> **Captain Buckle:** "The boat seems bigger. Are we on the same boat? Am I smaller?"

> **[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** "Maybe you do look a couple inches shorter."

[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth) has fully assumed command:

> **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth):** "I am the captain now."

Buckle hands her his hat—which reads: **"I got crabs at Joe's Shack."**

### Hiding the Orb

[Silas](/player-characters/silas) and [Bru](/player-characters/bru) build a **Faraday cage** out of metal sheeting to shield the orb from magical tracking. A luck roll comes up **natural 1**—the best possible result—producing a perfectly sealed container.

### The Rescued Knight

A Dragon Knight rescued from the water wakes up and asks about the dragon. [Silas](/player-characters/silas) maintains the lie, telling the knight the orb was lost in the ocean. The knight is more disappointed about missing out on a promotion for the dragon kill.

## Hero's Welcome

The ship pulls into Greyport harbor to a **line of Dragon Knights in dragon bone armor**, cheering from the docks. **Leroy's boat** is towing a **dead white dragon** behind it—they're providing roast dragon meat for the victory celebration.

> **Christopher (DM):** "You trickle into the harbor and you see a long line of dragon knights with their sick-ass dragon bone armor and they're cheering you on at the docks."

The session ends with the party arriving to a picnic in their honor—war heroes returning from the crash site, even if the Order doesn't know the half of what really happened.

## Key Information Learned

**The Dragon Fight:**
- Adult blue dragons can dive underwater and attack from below
- The dragon's lightning breath deals massive damage (69 on a full hit)
- The dragon has at least one Legendary Resistance
- It can go invisible while submerged

**Ship Operations:**
- The Order's ships have dual engines with key ignitions
- Radio callsigns include Leroy, Jenkins, and HQ
- The fleet lost at least one full ship (Jenkins' crew) to the dragon attacks
- Leroy's crew killed 2.5 dragons (white and copper)

**Strategic Moves:**
- The party told the Order the orb fell into the ocean (Deception 28)
- A Faraday cage now shields the orb from magical tracking
- A sending stone was thrown to Luna's crash site for future communication
- The sabotaged sensor relay is still sending false coordinates to the Order

## Character Moments

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas):** His quick thinking saves the party multiple times—from teleporting out of drowning waters to orchestrating the orb deception over radio. His idea to throw a sending stone to Luna may prove the session's most important strategic move.

**[Bru](/player-characters/bru):** Goes down twice to lightning breath but keeps getting back up. His decision to Enlarge the entire ship shows creative problem-solving under pressure, and his engine repair (rolling a 30) keeps the party from being stranded.

**[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia):** Fearlessly teleports onto a dragon's back in mid-flight and her Aura of Devotion saves [Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s life on a death save. Her Aid spell brings two unconscious allies back from the brink without even needing line of sight.

**[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth):** Discovers the ship's controls, starts the engines, takes over radio communications as "Big Sinks," and declares herself captain. Her practical engineering approach turns the tide when combat alone isn't enough.

**[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana):** Despite being barely conscious herself, she provides clutch Bardic Inspiration and Healing Words to keep [Bru](/player-characters/bru) in the fight. Her bold Polymorph attempt forces the dragon to burn a Legendary Resistance.

## Unresolved Threads

- Where is **Victor**, and can the party reach him at the zoo to use his sending stone?
- What will **Luna** say when they communicate through the sending stone?
- What's on the **floppy disc** with the real dragon orb coordinates from the sabotaged sensor relay?
- Will the Order of St. George believe the orb was lost in the ocean?
- How will the party navigate the **victory picnic** while secretly hiding the orb?
- What happened to the blue dragon? It dove deep and went invisible but was never confirmed dead.
- Will the **mercenary dragon knights** become suspicious as the party's deceptions mount?

The session ends with the party bruised, singed, and carrying secrets—an orb hidden in a Faraday cage, a sending stone thrown to a dead goddess, and a web of lies spun across the Order's radio network. They've survived the crash site, but the real challenge begins at the victory picnic: pretending to be loyal allies while plotting their next move against both the Order and Eldoran.
