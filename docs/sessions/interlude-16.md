# Interlude XVI: The Sacred Disturbance of Tortuga

## Session Overview

This flashback session revealed **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**'s life before the main campaign, when he was a young goblin (around 8-10 years old) living on the Island of Tortuga. The party played members of Bru's extended family—the **Bru's Cousins** bowling league—tasked by their godfather **Taskmaster Grit** with creating a "sacred disturbance" to awaken the Turtle God upon which their island rested. The session combined family comedy, goblin chaos, and explosive finales, ultimately revealing how the island rose from the sea and why Bru had to leave his homeland.

## The Bru Family & Bowling League

### The Sacred Mission

**Taskmaster Grit**, godfather of the Bru's Cousins bowling league, gathered the family for an urgent mission during the Winter King's holiday (winter solstice). The goblin religion required a **sacred disturbance**—a massive chaos event to shake the very foundation of their island and awaken the Turtle God. Multiple bowling leagues competed to create the biggest disturbance, with eternal consequences for failure.

**The Stakes:**
- Awaken the Turtle God through chaos
- Win prestige for the Bru's Cousins bowling league
- Avoid eternal damnation for insufficient disturbance
- Maintain bowling lane reservations for their nightlight session

### The Family Members

**Young Bru** (Justin) - Age 8-10, teenage angst phase, aspiring explosives expert with a leather jacket and dreams of creating the perfect firework. The youngest of the group but considered the natural leader due to his attention to detail.

**Drew** (Luke) - Bru's younger brother, high-energy goblin heavily addicted to cocaine (kept separate stashes for every occasion: walking cocaine, bathroom cocaine, dinner cocaine). Spoke rapidly, constantly bouncing, and prone to diving into piles of "snow" (mostly cocaine).

**Uncle Belch** (Tyram) - Bru's uncle, 9th level soulblade rogue with reliable talent and conspiracy theorist tendencies. Believed the Winter King was a front for the "mind flayer mafia" and taught Bru various paranoid theories.

**EA** (Ali) - Older cousin (spelled with all the Irish vowels: approximately 60 in goblin years), owner of a fireworks shop specializing in pranks and offensive shapes. Taught Bru his technical firework skills. Highly critical but ultimately helpful mentor figure.

**Martha "Auntie Poops"** (Ellis) - Joined mid-session, brought her own unique energy to the family chaos.

**Godfather Grit** - Taskmaster of the bowling league, perpetually vibrating with energy and stress, covered in chalk dust, speaks in urgent non-sequiturs. Has a score of 7 in bowling (terrible) because he was "trying to hit one pin every time."

### Goblin Culture on Tortuga

**Physical Traits:**
- Goblins mature by age 10
- Die frequently from heart attacks (hereditary epidemic)
- Have litters of children (large families)
- Considered "elderly" by age 60

**Social Structure:**
- Bowling leagues function as sacred covenants
- Everyone related by blood or bowling
- Cocaine use is normalized (micro-dosing throughout the day)
- 7-Eleven bathrooms are acceptable laboratory spaces

**Religious Beliefs:**
- The island rests on the back of a Turtle God
- Sacred disturbances are religious obligations
- The Winter King visits during winter solstice
- Wishes granted to best Winter King costume
- Dead sheep imagery is considered blasphemous

## The Winter King's Holiday

### Festival Atmosphere

The goblin city of Tortuga celebrated the winter solstice with chaotic festivities:

**Celebrations:**
- Everyone dressed as the Winter King (costume competition)
- "Snow" covering the city (various white substances—cocaine, chalk, other materials)
- Children having snowball fights (mud, rocks, and debris compacted together)
- Nightclubs with heavy EDM and glow stick usage
- Drug-fueled revelry throughout the city

**Winter King Tradition:**
- Best costume wins the right to make a wish
- Legend of a robot who wished for a stomach and received it
- Father Winter visits on this holy night

**The Snow:**
- Not actual snow (tropical region, too warm)
- Each establishment creates their own "snow" through goblin ingenuity
- Nightclubs use cocaine as snow effects
- Children play in various questionable white substances
- Drew acquired a full bag of nightclub cocaine for "personal use"

## The Oracle's Quest

### Mistress Tatterbottom

The family's mission required finding **Mistress Tatterbottom**, an oracle traveling through the city in her caravan during the festival. She supposedly had coordinates for where to create the sacred disturbance.

**The Caravan:**
- Traveling slowly through festival crowds
- Oracle available for readings
- Chalk line marked the path to follow
- Led eventually to a 7-Eleven

### The 7-Eleven Bathroom Laboratory

The oracle's directions led to an unexpected location: **the bathroom of a 7-Eleven convenience store** run by a Pakistani clerk.

**The Secret Laboratory:**
- Bru's explosive workshop hidden in the bathroom
- Contains slide puzzle lock on the door
- Equipped for firework construction
- Has sewer grate/ladder leading to nightclub below
- Oracle indicated this bathroom was key to the disturbance

**Notable Features:**
- Only one bathroom (creating a multi-hour occupancy problem)
- Vanessa (goblin customer) desperately needed to use it
- Slide puzzle security system
- Hidden entrance to the sewer system
- Direct access to the Nerve Hub nightclub

## The Vanessa Tragedy

### Meet Vanessa

A recurring NPC who became the session's tragic figure:

**Characteristics:**
- Goblin woman with weak bladder
- Needed bathroom urgently
- Drank water constantly (unusual for goblins)
- Ate unusual foods (pineapple pizza)
- Related to the family somehow
- Generally considered annoying by the family
- Kept insisting she needed to use the bathroom

### The Death Toll

Vanessa died **three separate times** during the session due to heart attacks:

**First Death:**
- Cardiac arrest while waiting for bathroom
- Family occupied bathroom for hours working on fireworks
- EA had been verbally abusive to her
- Pakistani clerk attempted CPR
- Blamed on hereditary heart attack epidemic (not family's fault)

**Second Death (Ghost Form):**
- Returned as multiple Vanessa spirits/ghosts
- Died again trying to keep up with Drew during jumping jacks
- Second cardiac arrest while exercising

**Third Death (Mass Multiplication):**
- Eventually split into "a thousand wraiths"
- Killed everyone in the goblin city
- Family reconciled with her "purely out of spite"

**Family Reaction:**
- "Vanessa sucks" (general consensus)
- Drew: "She really really sucks, can't stay alive"
- EA: "I'm so glad she's dead"
- Taskmaster Grit: "Why'd you have to kill Vanessa?"
- No one attended her funeral (discussed but decided it was "too much work")

## The Nerve Hub & Heart of Tortuga

### Underground Nightclub

The sewer ladder from the 7-Eleven bathroom led directly to the **Nerve Hub**, a major nightclub built near the literal beating heart of Tortuga.

**The Venue:**
- Heavy EDM music
- Glow sticks everywhere
- Massive drug usage (cocaine, hallucinogens)
- Winter solstice party in full swing
- DJs rhythm their music to the heartbeat of Tortuga

**The Heart of Tortuga:**
- Physical, beating heart beneath the island
- Creates rhythmic thumping: "boop boop boop"
- Shakes the nightclub with each beat
- Central to the island's existence
- Target location for the sacred disturbance

### The Laboratory Setup

Bru's explosive laboratory became the staging ground for the sacred disturbance:

**Equipment & Materials:**
- Firework construction supplies
- Multiple types of cocaine
- God ear wax jar (discovered later by Bru in present day)
- Leather jacket for Bru's "angsty teenage" aesthetic
- Various explosive components

**The Firework Design:**

Bru attempted to design a firework with a "B" symbol (for Bru), but EA took over:

**Original Design (Bru):**
- Large "B" shape
- Diamond in the center
- Amateurish construction
- Multiple technical flaws

**Final Design (EA's Improvements):**
- Bru family crest inside diamond
- Mug of brown liquid (signature drink)
- Tail of a pig
- 7-Eleven sign
- Small fireworks going off (meta reference)
- Sparkles and shards for visual impact
- Maximum razzle-dazzle and pizzazz

**Bru's Reaction:**
- "Oh my god, you never let me try anything!"
- "You never let me get better!"
- Stormed out of bathroom in teenage angst
- Witnessed Vanessa's first death
- Blamed by Pakistani clerk for the death

## The Sacred Disturbance

### The Plan

The family needed to create maximum chaos at the Nerve Hub to shake the Heart of Tortuga:

**Components:**
- Detach Heart of Tortuga from its moorings
- Set off massive firework display
- Use explosive laboratory as additional catalyst
- Perform ritual (including sitting backwards in chairs for "down and chill" vibes)
- Light final firework with Vanessa's spirit

**Execution:**
- Family infiltrated Nerve Hub through sewer entrance
- Set up explosives at the Heart
- Performed "sitting backwards in chairs" ritual
- Drew led group in cocaine-fueled jumping jacks
- Vanessa (ghost form) lit the final firework
- Bru watched from his laboratory

### The Catastrophic Success

The sacred disturbance exceeded all expectations:

**The Explosion:**
- Massive firework display showing Bru family crest
- Earth began to crack beneath the city
- Bru's laboratory broke free from the city
- Laboratory descended toward the ground below
- Island of Tortuga began rising from the sea

**The Awakening:**
- Turtle God awakened by the disturbance
- Island lifted on the back of the awakened turtle
- Entire goblin city began walking away on turtle's back
- Ground fell away beneath Bru's falling laboratory

### The Aftermath

**Immediate Consequences:**
- Bru deployed emergency parachute (all family members had them)
- Escaped falling laboratory as it crashed
- Watched his home city walk away on the turtle
- Separated from his entire family
- Forced to leave Tortuga

**Long-term Impact:**
- Island of Tortuga rose from the sea (recent event in campaign timeline)
- Connected to recent rift openings and dragon migrations
- Bru left his homeland forever
- Additional trauma for young Bru (witnessed Vanessa deaths, lost family)
- Explains Bru's age discrepancy (now established as 11-14 years old)

## Ongoing Plot Threads

1. **Bru's Return:** Can Bru reunite with his family now that he has access to the island (if any survived)?

2. **The God Ear Wax:** Bru discovered a jar of god ear wax in present day—connection to EA's spa business?

3. **Vanessa's Wraith:** Christopher noted to remind him "Vanessa might come back as a wraith to haunt them"—will this haunt Bru?

4. **Tortuga's Current State:** The island rose recently (aligns with rifts, dragon migrations in campaign)—what's happening there now?

5. **Family Reunion Possibility:** "Bru family reunion—oops, all bruises" discussed as future possibility

6. **Drew's Recovery:** Successfully got clean—could appear as NPC helping others?

7. **Uncle Belch's Bowling Alley:** If survived, might own the bowling alley now

8. **The Sacred Disturbance Success:** Did other bowling leagues also succeed? What happened to competitors?

9. **Pakistani Clerk's Ban:** "You and your family and your bowling team are never allowed in my 7-Eleven again"—permanent ban enforced?

## Key Revelations

1. **Bru's Age:** Confirmed as 11-14 years old (adjusted from original 10 to account for backstory timeline)

2. **Island Rising:** The rise of Tortuga on the Turtle God's back was directly caused by Bru's family's sacred disturbance

3. **Recent Event:** This backstory occurred within the past few years, not ancient history—connects to current campaign events (rifts opening, dragons migrating)

4. **Family Separation:** Bru lost his entire extended family when the island rose, explaining his isolation

5. **Explosives Origin:** Bru's expertise with explosives dates back to childhood, taught by EA

6. **Goblin Culture:** Extensive worldbuilding about goblin society, religion, and customs on Tortuga

7. **Heart Attack Epidemic:** Hereditary condition killing goblins daily, not anyone's specific fault

8. **Bowling as Religion:** Bowling leagues serve as sacred organizations, not just recreational clubs

9. **Winter King Holiday:** Major goblin religious festival with costume competitions and wish-granting

10. **The 7-Eleven Laboratory:** Bru's creative use of unconventional spaces for his work started young
