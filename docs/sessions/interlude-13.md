# Interlude XIII: The Sisyphus Circle

## Session Overview

This flashback session revealed the tragic origin story of Bru and Silas's partnership, showing the heist that claimed their entire original gang. The players took on the roles of the Sisyphus Circle: Bartleby Thatch (Silas's alias), 11-year-old Bru, nervous leader Sander, heavy-drinking Alma, zen driver Spoons, stoic muscle Peaches, and flamboyant bard Cream. What began as a celebratory heist-planning session at the Cog and Steam bar ended in total crew annihilation at the hands of Helja Ungar.

## The Setup: Planning at Cog and Steam

The Sisyphus Circle gathered at their favorite haunt, the Cog and Steam bar overlooking the Dne Zoo (featuring an owl bear petting zoo). The crew discussed their next job—stealing a mysterious item from the Pandora gang's three-story townhouse vault.

**Crew Introductions:**
- **Sander** - Anxious dwarf planner and gang leader, overly cautious about germs
- **Alma** - Sander's sister, a perpetually drunk dwarf who loved puzzles
- **Bartleby Thatch** - Halfling (Silas's alias), paranoid veteran thief
- **Bru** - 11-year-old goblin artificer with bombs and attitude
- **Spoons** - Human monk driver obsessed with kung fu videos
- **Peaches** - Half-orc muscle, strong and silent
- **Cream** - Gnome bard, Peaches's best friend with a miniature figurine collection

The crew distributed their equipment: a portable hole (nicknamed "the cornhole"), spider climbing slippers (2 pairs), dark vision goggles (2 pairs), an X-ray vision ring, and grappling hooks. They also engaged in their tradition of drinking moonshine with dirt rubbed on their tongues after each successful job.

**Target Building Layout:**
- Three-story townhouse with basement
- Vault on 2nd floor
- Three entry points: front door, roof, basement via sewers

## The Infiltration

**Sewer Approach:**  
Bru placed a bomb to blow open the sewer system, creating a distraction explosion of sewage that made residents think there was just a plumbing issue. The team ziplined across into the building's second floor.

**The Vault's Concentric Defenses:**  
The vault consisted of multiple layers, each with its own security system arranged like boxes within boxes. The team had to work their way through three distinct puzzle layers.

## The Rainbow Door Puzzle

The first vault layer featured a large circular door with seven concentric circles, alternating red and blue crystals.

**Puzzle Mechanics:**
- Each crystal changed color when touched: red → orange → yellow → green, blue → indigo → violet
- Alma discovered touching crystals cycled them through a rainbow spectrum
- The solution required arranging all crystals in ROY G BIV order (violet, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo)
- Peaches systematically touched crystals to create the rainbow sequence
- Door unlocked with satisfying click

**Running Gag:** Alma mentioned her relationship with Robin was getting serious, confusing everyone since Robin had never been mentioned before in the entire campaign.

## The Mirrored Hallways

Beyond the rainbow door, the vault split into two mirrored L-shaped hallways with interconnected mechanics.

**Left Hallway (Alma & Spoons):**
- Alma opened a door and triggered poison darts
- Dwarf poison resistance saved her (rolled 18 on con save)
- Found a button at the hallway's dead end
- Spoons navigated to another button, successfully dodging dart traps (rolled 25 on dex save)

**Right Hallway (Cream & Peaches):**
- Found identical mirrored layout
- Cream detected flame trap on door
- Discovered button mechanics: each hallway's buttons disarmed traps and unlocked doors in the OPPOSITE hallway

**Solution:** The crew established psychic phone communication (Silas's ability they should have used earlier). Alma and Spoons held down buttons in the left hallway while the rest of the team entered through the right hallway's now-safe door.

## The Clock Puzzle

The final vault layer featured time-themed decorations leading to an inscribed door.

**Room Contents:**
- 5 sundials with orbiting drift globes
- 4 hourglasses (various time increments, auto-flipping)
- 3 clock faces with 24-hour military time PLUS letters Y and Z

**Door Inscription:**  
"TWELVE EPOCH"

**Puzzle Solution:**
- Sander's investigation (19) revealed the clocks had 24 numbers plus letters Y and Z (creating 26 total positions)
- Each clock hand could point to letters corresponding to numbers
- The crew set the three clocks to spell out "TWELVE" using number-to-letter conversion:
  - T = 20
  - W = 23
  - E = 5
  - L = 12
  - V = 22
  - E = 5
- Door unlocked when clocks displayed the correct letter positions

**Inside the Vault:**  
The inner chamber contained numerous safes and drawers, but at the center sat an ornately carved mahogany box on a pedestal. A dragon was stenciled on top, polished to an impressive sheen. The box radiated a foreboding presence—a terrible secret waiting to be unleashed. The box was nailed to the pedestal, and Bartleby (Silas) began working the puzzle box with his skilled hands.

## The Ambush

**First Warning:**  
As the crew entered the vault's inner chamber, Bru (highest passive perception) heard crashing and yelling from downstairs. Alarms started sounding throughout the building.

**Preparations:**
- Silas worked on opening the puzzle box
- Bru placed remote explosive charges throughout the vault layers as they retreated
- The crew discovered fighting below—the Order of St. George (dragon slayers with lance-piercing-dragon-skull emblem) had raided the Pandora gang's headquarters
- Spoons prepared to return to the getaway car
- Alma insisted everyone evacuate

**The True Prize:**  
Silas successfully opened the box, revealing a black dragon orb with a galaxy-like star pattern swirling inside (like the galaxy from Men in Black). He shuddered as he touched it, establishing a connection that would haunt him for years. He stuffed it into his backpack.

**Escape:**
- The team made their way out via the zip line
- Bru detonated charges, collapsing the third floor onto the second
- The crew did a Tarzan-style swing across the street as explosions erupted behind them
- In practiced precision, they all put on sunglasses mid-swing (they'd rehearsed this cool moment)
- Spoons retrieved the getaway car

## The Blackwell Memorial Park Betrayal

The crew arrived at the drop point: Blackwell Memorial Park (a park for perverts, according to the gang). A lone cloaked figure waited in a clearing.

**The Exchange:**
- Sander approached with the code phrase: "My tribute to the queen"
- The figure responded: "To me what I am owed"
- A consigliere showed a chest full of gold payment
- Bartleby (paranoid as always) had switched bags with Bru during the drive, keeping the real orb safe while carrying a decoy medicine ball

**The Reveal:**  
When Bartleby handed over the bag and looked under the figure's hood, he saw **Helja Ungar**—head of the Iron Claws dwarven mafia. His face went pale. She smirked: "My reputation precedes me, it seems."

She insisted on shaking hands to seal the deal. Sander refused, citing germ concerns. Helja snapped her fingers.

## The Massacre

Gunmen emerged from trees and shrubs all around, opening fire on the crew.

**Deaths:**
- **Sander** - Jumped in front of Alma to shield her; both were shot together
- **Cream** - Shot in the knee trying to run
- **Peaches** - Slowed down to carry wounded Cream; both were killed by concentrated gunfire, dying in each other's arms
- **Spoons** - The getaway Ford F-150 was destroyed by grenades thrown under the fuel tank; Spoons died in the explosion (his birthday was supposed to be tomorrow, where he'd planned to meet disgraced racer LP)
- **Alma** - Killed alongside Sander (never got to ground Bru)

**The Escape:**  
Bru's force ballista cannon ran into the ambush and exploded next to Helja, tearing open the decoy bag and revealing the medicine ball instead of the orb. Enraged at the deception, Helja turned to pursue Silas and Bru.

The halfling and goblin took advantage of their small size, jumping into a storm drain. Grenades followed but exploded just outside the range. They found a strong current in the sewers—Silas grabbed Bru by the scruff of his neck and they both leapt in, getting swept away to safety outside city limits.

Bru was shell-shocked and silent, shutting down emotionally. This was the first time Kevin, his homunculus companion, came to life, saying "I am Kevin. I like warm hugs." Bru fell into Kevin and cried.

## The Aftermath: Dragon Horde Mountain

The flashback ended with present-day Silas and Bru at the Dragon Horde, watching the sunset. Silas poured drinks with dirt, their traditional toast. He reflected on Helja's death (which happened in present-day Campaign 4).

**Silas's Realization:**  
"I was wrong, you know? About getting soft when you start to give a shit about people. I don't think I would have stayed and fought if I didn't give a shit about you guys. Maybe. Or maybe I am just getting stupid."

He admitted: "For better or worse, we got a new gang now. Let's go join up with them again, I guess."

**The Portable Hole's Return:**  
Bru discovered the portable hole stuck to Kevin's overalls—"Oh, that's where that went!" The DM ruled (subject to veto) that the party now has a portable hole in their inventory.

## Character Moments

**Bru's Trauma:**  
The session showed why Bru doesn't process loss well—he completely shuts down when people die. His creation of Kevin likely stemmed from this traumatic night, giving him an unshakeable companion.

**Silas's Philosophy:**  
The massacre cemented Silas's "always keep moving" worldview: "This is why you don't stay. This is why you always have to move on. When you stay for a while, you get soft. You get sloppy. And this is what comes of it."

However, by the present day, Silas is reconsidering this belief after fighting alongside the current party.

**Tomorrow Never Comes:**  
Multiple crew members mentioned plans for tomorrow:
- Spoons's birthday and meeting racer LP
- Alma planning to ground Bru
- Cream's retirement and miniature figurine store
- Sander and Alma's relationship with Robin

None of them got their tomorrow.

## Key Revelations

1. **Helja's Grudge:** The dragon orb was never meant for Helja—Silas switched bags and escaped with it, creating an 11-year vendetta that led to her hunting them
2. **The Dragon Orb:** Now revealed to be the mysterious item Silas has been protecting all these years
3. **The Order of St. George:** Dragon slayers who raided the Pandora gang the same night, adding chaos to the heist
4. **Original Crew Composition:** The Sisyphus Circle was seven members before being reduced to just Bru and Silas
5. **Helisana Connection:** Mentioned as a potential client/cover after the massacre, possibly their first job after reforming

## Ongoing Plot Threads

- **The Dragon Orb's Purpose:** What was Helja planning to do with it?
- **Silas's Connection:** The orb established a "fateful connection" when he touched it—what does this mean?
- **Order of St. George:** Where are these dragon slayers now?
- **Bru and Silas's Next Move:** They mentioned meeting Helisana after this—is this how they entered the current storyline?
- **Portable Hole:** Will the party actually get to keep this powerful magic item?

## Session Conclusion

The session ended with the current-day Silas and Bru preparing to rejoin their new gang, having shared this painful memory. The flashback explained the deep bond between the halfling and goblin, forged in tragedy and escape. It also revealed why Silas is so paranoid about clients, why Bru shuts down during loss, and why both have commitment issues with their new party.

The DM (Tyram) balanced puzzle-solving, combat, character development, and tragic storytelling throughout the session, creating a complete heist narrative with an emotional gut-punch ending. The players' knowledge of the doomed outcome added dramatic irony to every optimistic statement about "tomorrow."
