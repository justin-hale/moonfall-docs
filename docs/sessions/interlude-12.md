## Session Overview

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** awakens to find a letter from **Naomi** at the **Lotus Casino** detailing an emergency: **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** and her ravers have taken over the casino, turned it into a 24/7 concert venue, and are holding it hostage. The party must infiltrate the chaos, find a hidden reset key, and activate the casino's magical failsafe to send everyone home before the establishment is permanently destroyed.

## The Morning Letter

### Naomi's Distress Call

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** receives an urgent letter from his girlfriend **Naomi** at the **Lotus Casino**:

**The Situation**:
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** and her ravers have completely taken over the casino
- The ravers are holding daily mandatory concerts and partying 24/7
- The casino lobby is trashed with graffiti, torn furniture, and a halfpipe built in the middle
- **Marvin Junior Junior Junior** has been kidnapped and incapacitated by **Helisanna**
- **Fufu** (the owl bear) is being forced to perform three shows a day with **David Blaine**
- **Naomi's** baby **Julius** can't sleep due to the constant noise

**The Invitation**:
- A gold card labeled "Guest Transport" dated for 10:00 a.m.
- Fine print (requiring investigation to read) explains holding the card will teleport the party to the Lotus
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** immediately rallies the party for a rescue mission

## Gathering the Team

### The Morning Brief

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** wakes **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** by pulling the covers off him, revealing **Pepsi** (the baby dragon) curled up on the bed with **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** squeezed into a tiny corner. The party gathers in **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s** apartment in **High Forge** where they've been staying:

**Living Arrangements**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** and **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** share George's old bunk beds (with Pepsi claiming the top bunk)
- **Kevin** (the minion) sneaks into bed with **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** and **Boxbox**
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** returns from her daily bodega run with muffins
- The party discusses the mission over breakfast

**The Team**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: Leading the mission to rescue his "honey lamb" Naomi
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**: Bringing his engineering expertise and Pepsi
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)**: Initially joining but ultimately staying with baby Julius
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)**: Providing support and sneaking skills
- **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)**: Former connection to Helisanna, now in a complicated situation
- **[Scarlet]**: Coming along despite **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s** warnings not to get inspired by interdimensional travel
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)**: Joining the infiltration team

## Arrival at the Lotus

### Chaos in the Lobby

The party teleports to the **Lotus Casino** lobby at exactly 10:00 a.m., discovering absolute pandemonium:

**The Destruction**:
- Graffiti covering every surface
- Curtains and furniture torn apart and scattered
- The statue of **Marvin's** ancestor defaced with painted-on glasses and a dick on his cheek, random clothes on its head
- A halfpipe constructed in the middle of the lobby (which **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** admits is "pretty sick")
- Ravers everywhere drinking, partying, skating, and attempting to start bonfires (constantly extinguished by the magic fire suppression system)

**Naomi's Greeting**:
- Perfectly dressed and composed despite the chaos around her
- Quickly ushers the party to the back office to avoid drawing attention
- Explains the full extent of the crisis

## The Resistance Meeting

### Naomi's Plan

In a hidden supply closet in the laundry room (the most boring, back-of-house location possible), **Naomi** has assembled **"The Resistance"**:

**Resistance Members**:
- **Naomi**: Upper management, organizing the operation
- **Spike Bison** and his bodyguards **Click** and **Clack** (notably without **Fufu**)
- **Carl from Maintenance**: An elderly crotchety man immune to Helisanna's thrall
- **Lily** and **Lana** from the spa
- The unnamed British-voiced bartender
- Various other loyal employees

**The Factory Reset Button**:
- Built by **Marvin's** great-grandfather as a failsafe for casino takeovers
- Will reset the casino's magic, sending all unauthorized guests home
- Relocates the casino in space and time to cut off access temporarily
- Normally **Marvin** could activate it, but he's been kidnapped by **Helisanna**

**The Problem**:
- The reset requires a special key
- **Marvin** gave the key to his "most trusted employee" before being captured
- No one has come forward with the key, and the resistance can't figure out who has it
- **Helisanna** doesn't know the key or button exists

## The Investigation

### Deducing the Key's Location

The party analyzes the situation with insight checks:

**High Rollers**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: Natural 20 on insight
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**: 21 on insight
- **[Scarlet]**: Shocking 28 on insight

**The Deduction**:
- **Marvin**, while incompetent with potions, is actually quite knowledgeable about magic
- He would know the key needed to go to someone who:
  - Wouldn't fall under **Helisanna's** thrall
  - Is well-trained and reliable
  - Is a "good boy"
- The party quickly deduces: **It's Fufu!**

**The Time Crunch**:
- **David Blaine's** magic show starts in 10 minutes
- **Fufu** will be performing in the middle of the act
- The party must get the key from **Fufu** before he goes on stage

## Infiltrating the Theater

### Disguises and Performance Checks

The party uses **Hats of Disguise** to appear as ravers and make their way to the theater:

**First Attempt** (Performance checks):
- **[Scarlet]**: 28 (extremely convincing)
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: 26 (very convincing)
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**: 18 (solid performance)
- **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)**: Low roll (struggling)
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)**: Only toral in the casino, draws some attention but passes

**Scarlet's Faux Pas**:
- **[Scarlet]** sees **Fufu** backstage and exclaims "Holy shit, what is that thing?"
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** scolds her: "Were you raised in a barn? It's just Fufu, it's not that big a deal"
- The party debates whether to use speak with animals or animal handling

### Retrieving the Key

**Finding Fufu**:
- **Fufu** is backstage waiting for his cue, wearing an adorable glittery gold vest with a tiny tuxedo and top hat
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** investigates with advantage from **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s** help: rolls 21
- On **Fufu's** collar, nestled against his glittery vest, is a golden name tag with a picture of a key on it

**The Retrieval**:
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** gives **Fufu** part of **Kevin's** treat (saving the other half for Kevin)
- **Fufu** gives her a big lick and happily lets her take the key card
- **Fufu** runs off to his performance cue as the party celebrates

**Quick Success**:
- The entire infiltration takes less than 10 minutes
- **Naomi** is impressed by their efficiency (she had prepared puzzles and challenges that weren't needed)

## The Basement Journey

### Psychic Phone Setup

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** activates his psychic phone ability to connect the party telepathically for six hours:

**The Comedy**:
- Everyone can hear each other's thoughts
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** pretends to be **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: "You're a stupid, stupid, stupid head"
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** responds that he comes up with way better insults than that
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** just does heavy breathing into the mental link
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** eventually cuts **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** off: "You abused the phone privileges and they've been revoked"
- **[Scarlet]** tries to call people but no one responds

### Second Disguise Run

The party makes their way to the basement entrance with another round of performance checks:

**Second Performance Results**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: Another 26 (consistently convincing)
- Most of the party does well
- **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)** and **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** use bardic inspiration after poor initial rolls
- **[Scarlet]** trips and loses her hat, but the party forms a protective circle around her to shield her from ravers

**Navigation**:
- **Naomi** provides directions to use the key to access the basement elevator
- The key grants security clearance to the restricted basement level
- The party takes the elevator down to the secure area

## The Basement Puzzle Chambers

### Chamber 1: The Aquan Door

The elevator opens into a dimly lit stone chamber with a single door at the far end. Next to the door sits a basin filled with water. Symbols are carved into the wall above the door.

**The Puzzle**:
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** rolls exceptional history checks (including one result in the mid-20s)
- He instantly recognizes the symbols as **Aquan**, his native underwater language
- The text reads: "Ask me to proceed"
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** attempts to speak Aquan but nothing comes out - he realizes he's never been able to speak his native tongue since leaving his underwater home

**The Solution**:
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** climbs onto **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)'s** back and pushes his head toward the water
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** realizes the language can only be spoken underwater
- Submerged in the basin, **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** says "May we proceed?" in Aquan
- The door immediately opens
- The party notes that **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** can hold his breath for an hour but cannot breathe underwater

### Chamber 2: Don't Knock the Door

The party enters a stone room with a door bearing text in Common: "Do not knock the door" (with "knock" capitalized).

**Initial Confusion**:
- **[Scarlet]** tries to simply open the door and takes 3 bludgeoning damage from a golden magical force that punches her back
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** flexes and tries to force the door open, taking 2 bludgeoning damage from another punch
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** uses mage hand to caress/knock the door - it takes damage and dissipates
- **[Scarlet]** casts detect magic and determines it's abjuration (protection) magic
- The party debates getting the water bowl from the previous room, trying knock-knock jokes, and whether "knock" is some kind of magical spell

**Scarlet's Book Problem**:
- Throughout the puzzle, **[Scarlet]** keeps pulling out books: "100 Riddles and Puzzles," a book about water bowls, "Alexandra's Favorite Stone Room Book"
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** and **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** keep slapping books out of her hands
- "This is where book burning starts"
- **[Scarlet]** reveals she has a bag of holding filled with books (accidentally established as canon by DM Ellis)

**The Breakthrough**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** rolls a 29 on insight
- Realizes "knock" in Common has multiple meanings beyond physically knocking
- It can also mean to insult or criticize
- The sign means "Do not knock (insult) the door"

**The Solution**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** compliments the door: "Door, you are the finest door I have ever seen in my short time here on this earth. And I got to say, you're my favorite door"
- The door immediately opens
- Ellis (DM) admits they were very close to solving it early on when someone briefly mentioned complimenting but didn't follow through

### Chamber 3: The Sign Language Door

This room contains a door with no handle. Pictograms cover the walls showing a figure using hand signs to communicate a message.

**Investigation**:
- **[Scarlet]** rolls 25 on investigation
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** rolls 29 on insight (continuing his hot streak)
- The images depict someone using sign language, but most of the party can't read it

**The Solution**:
- **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)** knows sign language
- She reads the message: "To go forward, you must go back"
- The party tries walking back through the previous door, but it simply closes behind them
- They realize they need to walk *backwards* through the next door
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** walks backward through the door and disappears, teleporting to the next room
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** doesn't walk backward well due to his shell, so he does a backwards jumping "cowabunga" through the door, nearly crashing into **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** (who makes a DC 22 Dexterity save to dodge)
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** climbs onto **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)**, and when **[Scarlet]** walks through backward, **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** "accidentally" puts his hands on her rear, leading to jokes about **[Scarlet]** having books on "goblin love"

### Chamber 4: The Crushing Ceiling

The final chamber is sunken down (like a conversation pit) with a lever next to a door with no handle on the far side.

**The Trap**:
- **[Scarlet]** (having the lowest HP at 26/29) volunteers to pull the lever
- The ceiling begins slowly descending to crush the party
- Pushing the lever back makes it stop and retract to its original position
- There's no other interactable object in the room

**Failed Attempts**:
- The party tries opening the door while holding the lever down - nothing happens
- They consider lying flat under where the previous door was to avoid being crushed
- They debate running back through the door they came through after pulling the lever
- **[Scarlet]** lays down in the "conversation pit" and pulls the lever

**The Solution**:
- The party realizes they need to let the ceiling come all the way down
- It's not actually crushing them - it's lowering the entire floor/room to the next level
- They pull the lever and wait as the room descends
- When it stops, they're at the basement level with the reset chamber

## The Reset Room

**Naomi** explains the reset mechanism as they enter the final chamber:

**The Reset Mechanism**:
- A large circular chamber with crystalline walls
- In the center: a pedestal with a slot for the key card
- Magical runes covering the floor in concentric circles
- A large lever next to the pedestal

**Naomi's Explanation**:
- Inserting the key and pulling the lever will activate the reset
- Everyone not an official employee will be sent back to where they teleported from
- The casino will relocate in space/time and be inaccessible for an unknown period
- **Naomi** and the baby will be stuck until the magic resets and stabilizes

### The Emotional Farewell

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** has a moment with **Naomi** before activating the reset:

**The Conversation**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: "So we're going to be cut off from each other for who knows how long?"
- **Naomi**: "I know, honey bear. But this is the only way to save the casino and get Julius some sleep"
- They discuss trying to establish communication while she's trapped
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** promises to find a way to stay in touch
- **Naomi** confirms she'll use the separation to focus on baby care and recovery

**Final Warnings**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** to **[Scarlet]**: "Promise you won't be inspired by anything related to interdimensional travel"
- **[Scarlet]**: "What? Why would I not be inspired by interdimensional travel?"
- The party debates whether to drop **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** in the ocean when she gets sent back
- **[Leliana](/player-characters/leliana)** argues they should try to save **Helisanna** since she's still technically an ally
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** notes she worked really hard on **Helisanna's** outfits and doesn't want that to go to waste

## Activating the Reset

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** inserts the key card into the slot and pulls the lever:

**The Reset Effect**:
- Magical energy swirls around the room
- The runes on the floor light up in sequence
- A countdown timer appears in the air: 60 seconds
- Throughout the casino, magical pulses ripple outward
- Ravers begin disappearing in flashes of light, sent back to **High Forge**
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** and her entire entourage vanish mid-concert
- The halfpipe, graffiti, and destruction begin magically cleaning and repairing
- **Marvin** reappears in his office, confused but unharmed

**The Party's Departure**:
- The party members begin glowing as the teleportation magic affects them
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** blows a kiss to **Naomi**
- **Naomi**: "I'll see you soon, sugar bear"
- Flash of light, and the party is back in **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s** apartment in **High Forge**
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** and all the ravers are back in **High Forge**, confused
- **Pepsi** is happy to see everyone return

## Session Conclusion

This interlude provided a lighter, more comedic adventure with clever puzzle-solving and character moments. The party solved the basement trials much faster than the DM anticipated (who had prepared additional puzzles), demonstrating their growing problem-solving skills. **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s** relationship with **Naomi** added emotional weight to the otherwise humorous session, while **[Scarlet]'s** book obsession and the psychic phone antics kept things entertaining.

The session successfully balanced humor with genuine character development and sets up future complications with the **Lotus Casino** offline and **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** returning to **High Forge**.

## Next Session Preview

The party discussed planning for next week's session:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** and **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s** backstory heist where their crew was killed by **Helja** in **Greyport**
- Other players will create third-level characters for the crew (suggested names: **Peaches**, **Cream**, **Rocky Road**, **Strawberry Shortcake**)
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** will be known as **"Bartleby Thatch"** during the heist
- The session will be run as a flashback/memory sequence
