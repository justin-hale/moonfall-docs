## A Desperate Morning

The party awakens to Chalk Rock frantically alerting them that the Iron Claws have taken hostages in the great hall and are threatening to execute them. Despite some initial skepticism from Silas and Bru about whether they should care, the group quickly realizes the gravity of the situation when they learn the hostages include George (Olivia's nephew), Will, Rosco, Belvolt, Finnwick (who is actively bleeding out), and Lady Corwin.

The party debates their approach while shopping for last-minute magical items and preparing for what promises to be their final confrontation with the Iron Claws. They use magical disguises to blend in with the ravers preparing for Helisanna's concert in the great hall.

## The Hostage Crisis

Arriving at the great hall, the party discovers:
- Six cages containing hostages suspended on scaffolding over the bridge
- At least a dozen elite Iron Claw guards positioned throughout the hall
- Lieutenant Grimjaw (seemingly resurrected and sewn back together) and Captain Corwin (Triple C, looking like a vacant undead puppet) commanding the operation
- Helisanna's ravers preparing for a concert, seemingly unconcerned with the hostage situation

Silas scouts ahead using his hat of disguise to appear as an Iron Claw soldier. The party splits up to rescue multiple hostages simultaneously, with some heading to the upper level and others staying below.

## Battle in the Great Hall

As Helisanna's concert begins (with a musical timer counting down), chaos erupts:

**Initial Rescues:**
- Silas stabs and kills one guard near George's cage
- Elspeth uses telekinetic shove to push an Iron Claw into the lava
- Bru uses his cannon to push another guard into the lava with force ballista
- Olivia (controlled by Taylor) attacks and defeats the guard threatening George
- Leliana heals the dying Finnwick with healing word

**The Ravers Join the Fight:**
- Helisanna begins her electric guitar performance, unleashing Eldritch blasts at the Iron Claws
- Her ravers, fulfilling their mission, swarm through the hall attacking Iron Claw soldiers
- The party continues fighting under time pressure as the music creates urgency

**Key Moments:**
- Olivia and Bob (her ram mount) lead charges on the upper level
- Ohma delivers devastating martial arts attacks, dealing massive damage
- Bru's heat metal spell causes excruciating damage to an Iron Claw, who eventually jumps into the lava to escape the pain
- Multiple hostages are freed, though Belvolt is injured and Lady Corwin dies
- Leliana uses hypnotic pattern to incapacitate several enemies including Marta

## The Ultimate Deception

In a shocking turn, Silas reveals a plan he's been secretly coordinating with Bru:

**The Setup:**
- Silas stabs Bru (his own party member) to sell his deception
- He claims to Lieutenant Grimjaw that he wants to betray the party for money
- Grimjaw brings the group before Helja Ironart in the throne room of the forge heart

**The Negotiation:**
- Silas presents a fake orb to Helja, claiming it's the real dragon-controlling artifact
- He demands one million gold pieces to leave the city and reveal the real orb's location
- Helja, surrounded by her elite guards and iron golems, initially threatens violence
- Silas uses his knowledge of the approaching dragons (through a tunnel Bru is opening) as leverage
- Throughout the negotiation, Silas uses psychic phone to relay detailed thoughts about the room's layout to the party

**The Trap:**
- While negotiating, Bru secretly plants explosive charges throughout the throne room
- He strings them along structural weak points and under the bridge
- The charges are set on a timed sequence to detonate on Bru's signal

**The Assassination:**
- When Helja agrees to shake on the deal, Silas gives the signal: "Now"
- Bru's explosives detonate, causing massive structural damage to the throne room
- In the chaos, Silas attacks Helja with surprise
- He critically strikes with a natural 20, dealing 51 damage with sneak attack
- His attacks are personal—he whispers "What were their names?" referring to his crew that Helja killed in Grayport
- Helja doesn't remember them, highlighting the casual cruelty of her villainy
- Silas coordinates with Bru's cannon for the killing blow—flames incinerate Helja from inside her mouth, leaving only a skeleton falling into her throne

## Desperate Escape

With Helja dead, the throne room begins collapsing:

**Chaos Ensues:**
- Multiple dexterity saving throws as debris falls from the crumbling facade
- Silas uses his evasion to avoid damage despite his low HP (only 6 remaining)
- Several of Helja's lieutenants use teleportation rings to escape
- Ohma successfully steals Marta's teleportation ring with sleight of hand
- Ohma then kicks Marta off a ledge, though she survives and casts a spell

**The Chase:**
- Grimjaw attempts to flee across the collapsing bridge
- Triple C (zombie Captain Corwin) attacks Silas but is fought off
- Bru's timed explosives continue detonating in sequence
- The party races across the bridge as explosions chase them
- Bob (Olivia's ram) becomes restrained but is dismissed and resummoned
- Multiple party members take significant damage from falling debris (30 damage to those who failed their saves)
- Despite attempts to stop them, both Grimjaw and Triple C survive and escape

**Final Moments:**
- The party reaches the door just as the final charge detonates
- Silas questions why Bru didn't use a remote detonator instead of a timer
- Bru responds that "timers are always more fun"
- The session ends on a cliffhanger as they escape through the doorway

## Character Moments

**Silas's Revenge:** His personal vendetta against Helja for killing his crew in Grayport drives the entire deception plan. His cold professionalism in negotiating with her, only to personally execute her, shows both his tactical mind and emotional core.

**Bru's Engineering:** Justin's elaborate trap with timed explosives showcases Bru's artificer skills and willingness to take risks. His coordination with Silas demonstrates growing trust despite their usual dynamic.

**Leliana's Support:** Luke's strategic use of crowd control spells (hypnotic pattern) and support abilities (mantle of inspiration, healing word) proves crucial in keeping the party alive during chaotic combat.

**Ohma's Pragmatism:** Walden's monk demonstrates both combat prowess and tactical thinking by stealing Marta's escape ring and attempting to eliminate threats.

**Elspeth's Determination:** Ali's paladin shows her protective nature, particularly in saving Belvolt and trying to ensure everyone escapes safely.

**Party Dynamics:** The session highlights the party's ability to coordinate complex plans under pressure, even when some members (like Leliana and Elspeth) aren't fully briefed on the deception.

## Key Information Learned

- Helja Ironart is dead, killed by Silas and Bru
- The Iron Claws' leadership is scattered—Grimjaw and Triple C escaped, while others like Car and Athena used teleportation rings to flee
- Marta is dead, killed by the explosions
- The forge heart throne room is destroyed
- Several teleportation rings exist that allow instant escape
- The party successfully saved most hostages: George, Will, Rosco, Finnwick (all survived); Lady Corwin died; Belvolt was injured but stabilized

## Unresolved Threads

- What happened to the approaching dragons?
- Where did the surviving Iron Claw leaders teleport to?
- Will Grimjaw and Triple C seek revenge?
- What will be the political fallout in High Forge with Helja dead?
- Can the party now use Marta's teleportation ring?
- What role will Helisanna and her ravers play going forward?

The session masterfully blended intense combat, clever deception, personal drama, and explosive action (literally). The party's coordinated betrayal of Helja represents a major turning point in the campaign, though the escape of key villains ensures future complications.
