*Monk • Order of St. George • Luna Worshipper*

## Overview

- **Connection**: Shares the same monastic training and techniques as Ohma

### Joining the Order
Bafael infiltrated the Order of St. George with a specific purpose:
- **Primary Goal**: Discover what happened to Luna and her fate
- **Motivation**: Investigate the connection between Luna and Noraxis (the dragon god of fire)
- **Concern**: Not fully aligned with the Order's dragon-slaying agenda

## Abilities

- **Combat Training**: Standard monk martial arts from the same monastery as Ohma

## Role in the Story

### Session 40: Meeting at the Docks
Bafael appears at the docks surrounded by dragon knights, conscripting Captain Buckle's fishing vessel for an expedition to Luna's crash site. When [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) recognizes him, he reveals:
- **The Order's Alliance**: The Order of St. George is working directly with the Eldoran Empire
- **The Moon Weapon**: They plan to weaponize the same device that struck down Luna to use against Noraxis
- **Moral Conflict**: Uncertain about aligning with people obsessed with killing all dragons

> **Bafael:** "These people—I am not sure that they align with what we should align with. They are obsessed with killing dragons. But you know the legend of Luna and the dragon god of fire—they were together."

### Session 41: Strategic Conference
Before reaching the ritual site, Bafael meets privately with the party to discuss their plans:

#### The Mercenary Revelation
> **Bafael:** "They are mercenaries. So if you have money, we can take this boat back. Right now, they are aligned with St. George. So if you do something, they will fight you unless you offer a better price."

#### The Eldoran Alliance
Explains the unholy partnership between the Order and the Empire:
- **Eldoran's Goal**: Kill all gods to make their god Eldora more powerful
- **St. George's Goal**: Kill all dragons
- **Shared Plan**: Use the Eldoran moon weapon to destroy draconic gods, including Noraxis

#### Philosophical Challenge
> **Bafael:** "I don't know your direction. You seem like you think about what is right now, but I don't know what the end goal is. You fight the dragon. You fight the empire. Are you going to fight everyone?"

### The Scorpion Philosophy
Bafael shares his worldview on destructive forces:

> **Bafael:** "Not every destructive force is evil. It is in itself an aspect, an agent of chaos, an element of our universe moving forward. A scorpion is a scorpion, right? But is a scorpion evil?"

He reveals two scorpions at the ship's zoo, prompting Ohma to mention a cultural superstition:
> **Ohma:** "One scorpion, three scorpion, five scorpion, but two—never. It is a very bad omen."

### Ritual Preparations
At Luna's crash site, Bafael directs the ritual setup:

> **Bafael:** "I have learned this through my studies. I brought this big sack of salt. You said you brought the spheres of violescence from the ship. Let us arrange it now."

> **Bafael:** "We must all pour our blood into the bowl. We must give our blood freely, and then it will start the ritual."

When the party questions who should lead:
> **Bafael:** "I cannot lead you to this ritual. You lead me to this ritual."
