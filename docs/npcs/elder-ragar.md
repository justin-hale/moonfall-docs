## Quotes

*"Only someone of the Skyhammer bloodline can power our spacecraft. The knowledge of how this works was lost when your parents died. The trials will either unlock this knowledge or kill you in the attempt."* - Elder Ragar explaining the crisis

*"Your tattoo... I recognize that style. You are of the Skyhammer clan. But how? We thought the prince was lost."* - Recognizing Red

*"I will not lie to you, Thurnok. The trials are deadly. Many have entered. Few have returned. But you are of the main bloodline. You have the best chance. The only chance."* - Honest about danger

**Historical Note**: Elder Ragar carries the burden of leading a clan whose purpose is threatened, watching their last hope walk into deadly trials, and living with the knowledge that he must ask a young man he barely knows to risk death for a heritage that was stolen from him.
