# April Bonal

*Human • Chemist • Underground Dweller*

## Overview

**April Bonal** is a human socialite from a wealthy chocolate trading family who went missing after attending a Doomfall concert. A talented chemist, she was captured and subjected to experiments before escaping to live in High Forge's underground sewer systems, where she continues her chemical research and provides sanctuary to others.

## Background

### Family and Wealth
- **Family Business**: Chocolate trading empire
- **Social Status**: Socialite with connections

- **Missing Persons Case**: Investigated by Detective Chalk Rock
- **Connected Disappearances**: Casey Bones, Bernardo, Montgomery Bell, Taylor Kyler Moore
- **Friends**: Snickers and Kit Kat (looking for her)

## Capture and Experiments

### Synthesis Laboratory
- **Abduction**: Taken from concert to experimental facility
- **Test Subject**: Experimented on at synthesis lab
- **Connected Cases**: Part of larger pattern of missing persons
- **Lab Location**: Where party previously rescued test subjects
- **Escape**: Successfully fled captivity

### Effects of Experiments
- Unknown what experiments were conducted
- Physical/mental impacts unclear
- Developed enhanced or altered abilities (speculation)
- Survived experience to continue chemistry work

## Underground Life (Sessions 33-35)

### Sewer Encampment
**Location**: Underground system beneath High Forge

**Residents**:
- **April Bonal** - Running chemistry operations
- **Casey Bones** - Fellow escapee/underground dweller
- **Bernardo** - Tortle monk (Ohma's fellow monk)
- Later: Taco Cat party members

**Facilities**:
- Chemistry set for April's work
- Living quarters
- Kitchen/dining area
- Hot tub (installed by Litu)
- Street hockey practice area (Casey Bones)

### Chemical Research

**Focus**: Poison development and refinement
- Trying to improve poison formulations
- Testing on willing (?) subjects
- Chemistry set always active
- Continuous experimentation

**The Bru Incident** (Session 35):
- Bru tested April's poison
- Nearly died multiple times from toxin
- April watched with "scientific curiosity"
- Insisted poison "should have killed him by now"
- Remarkable resistance surprised her
- Continued arguing with Bru about poison afterward

## Personality
