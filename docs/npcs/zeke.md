# Zeke

*Suspected Assassin • Marion and Robert's Killer • Eldoran Agent?*

## Overview

**Zeke** is the prime suspect in the murder of Marion and Robert Cross, [Red](/player-characters/red)'s adoptive parents who were protecting the hidden Skyhammer prince. This brutal act eliminated the only people who knew how the Skyhammer bloodline power worked, creating a crisis for the [Skyhammer Clan](/organizations/skyhammer-clan) and setting Red on his path toward the trials.

## Basic Information

- **Crime**: Murder of Marion and Robert Cross
- **Status**: At large, fate unknown

- **Threat Level**: Killed Red's parents, extremely dangerous

### Physical Description

- Professional assassin likely

## The Crime

### Marion and Robert Cross Murders
**Double Homicide**:

### Timing
**Pre-Campaign**:

## Motive

### Suspected Eldoran Connection
**Imperial Assassination** (Theory):
- Empire wants Red/Thurnok Skyhammer dead or controlled
- Marion and Robert hiding Red from Empire
- Empire tracked them down
- Zeke as imperial agent or contractor
- Elimination of threat to Empire

### Alternative Theories

**Option 1: Hired Assassin**:
- Someone paid Zeke to kill them
- Professional killer for hire
- Empire as client
- Other enemies possible
- Mercenary with no personal stake

**Option 2: Personal Vendetta**:
- Zeke had grudge against Marion/Robert
- Personal rather than political
- Revenge or past conflict
- Coincidental that victims protected Red
- Less likely given circumstances

**Option 3: Criminal Connection**:
- Marion/Robert's cover identities exposed
- Criminal past or false identities revealed
- Zeke as criminal enforcer
- Unrelated to Skyhammer heritage
- Wrong place, wrong time
