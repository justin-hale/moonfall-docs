# The Ravers

*Underground Movement • Ach'uk's Thralls • Musical Cult*

## Overview

**The Ravers** are thousands of teenagers and young adults with purple eyes who gather for massive underground parties, supernaturally influenced by Helisanna's performances and ultimately controlled by the ancient entity **Ach'uk**. What began as devoted music fans has evolved into a mind-controlled army with potentially catastrophic implications.

## Origins

### Helisanna's Concerts (Session 1+)
**The Purple Eyes Begin**:
- First appearance during Helisanna's transcendent concert at The Little Hovel
- Audience members' eyes glowed purple during performance
- Magic filled the air during shows
- Surreal, euphoric atmosphere
- Initially seemed like amazing show success

### Supernatural Influence
**Ach'uk's Touch**:
- Warlock patron's power manifesting through music
- Compulsion effects through performances
- Gradually spreading influence
- Thousands affected over time
- Mind control disguised as fandom

## The Movement

### Demographics
- Primarily teenagers and young adults
- Thousands in High Forge alone
- Underground scene participants
- Last seen at Doomfall concerts
- Missing persons cases connected

### Underground Gatherings
**The Underground Nightclub** (Session 26):
- Massive underground rave discovered
- Thousands with purple eyes gathered
- "Greatest party of all time" atmosphere
- Persistent bass music reverberating
- Right next to resistance headquarters
- Enormous scale of influence revealed

## Supernatural Control

### Purple Eyes
**Mark of Influence**:
- Visible indicator of Ach'uk's control
- Supernatural compulsion active
- Enhanced party/music experience
- Loss of autonomy
- Withdrawal effects when influence removed

### The High (Session 27)
**Violessence (V) Connection**:
- Ravers affected by Helisanna's supernatural influence
- Initially sustained by lake water containing V
- Exhausted natural V supply, now purchase from Helja (Iron Claws)
- Substance enhances or mimics supernatural control
- Creates dependency and vulnerability

### Withdrawal Effects
**When Influence Fades**:
- Several days of catatonia
- Violent desperation follows
- Can eventually recover through detox
- Requires significant time and support
- Not permanently damaged but changed

## Leadership and Organization

### Helisanna/Ach'uk Control
**Chain of Command**:
- Ach'uk (ancient entity) provides power
- Helisanna (fully possessed, Session 34) as vessel
- Purple-eyed ravers as followers/army
- Thousands respond to her direction

### Sia (Session 27)
**Raver Representative**:
- Part of underground raver faction
- Plans involve throwing parties in Under Lake
- More recreational focus initially
- Connected to broader raver network

## The Army

### Post-Split Numbers (Session 34-35)
**Massive Force**:
- Thousands of purple-eyed followers
- Carried possessed Helisanna away after split
- Committed to Iron Claws attack plan
- Gathered at Great Hall for concert (Session 36)
- Unpredictable after immediate goals met

### Capabilities
**As Controlled Force**:
- Overwhelming numbers (thousands)
- Coordinated through Helisanna/Ach'uk
- Compulsion makes them fearless
- Could "party the city to death" per legends
- Violence potential unclear but concerning

## Iron Claws Connection

### Drug Supply (Session 27)
**Violessence Trade**:
- Ravers exhausted lake water V supply
- Now purchase from Helja/Iron Claws
- Creates economic dependence
- Iron Claws profit from supernatural addiction
- Control mechanism through supply

### Temporary Alliance (Sessions 35-36)
**Strategic Cooperation**:
- Ravers committed to Great Hall concert
- Helisanna's performance part of Iron Claws attack
- Coordination between Ach'uk and criminals
- Served both parties' immediate interests
- Fate after Iron Claws defeat uncertain

## Great Hall Concert (Session 36)

### The Performance
**Helisanna's Show**:
- Thousands of ravers gathered
- Electric guitar and Eldritch blasts
- Supernatural performance
- Part of battle against Iron Claws
- Ach'uk's full power displayed

### Post-Battle Status
**Current State**:
- Iron Claws leadership eliminated
- Concert/battle concluded
- Ravers' next actions unclear
- Still under Ach'uk's influence
- Potential ongoing threat

## The Raver Problem

### Party's Assessment (Session 35)
**Difficult Situation**:
- Cannot defeat Helisanna/ravers in direct combat
- Thousands under supernatural control
- Could lead to genocide rather than liberation
- "Party the city to death" possibility real
- Ancient primordial power beyond current capabilities

### Proposed Solutions
**Containment Strategies**:
- **Vegas Solution**: Lotus Casino residency for Helisanna
  - Gives venue for nightly performances
  - Free booze and adoring crowds
  - Contains threat without combat
  - Keeps ravers occupied with shows
  
- **Musical Counter**: Liliana's rock-off with Helisanna
  - Bardic magic vs. warlock power
  - Might break or contest control
  - Risky but non-violent option
  
- **Long-term Rescue**: Seek Joel's help
  - Break Ach'uk's pact with Helisanna
  - Free ravers from control
  - High-level intervention needed

## Ancient Legends

### "Party the City to Death"
**Historical Warnings**:
- Ancient legends describe Ach'uk's influence
- Cities consumed by eternal revelry
- Participants dance until death
- Melancholic music as weapon of destruction
- Ravers could fulfill this prophecy

### Dwarvish Records
- Ruthalk (Ach'uk) documented in dwarven histories
- Past occurrences of raver phenomena
- Cautionary tales about musical cults
- Methods of containment or defeat (possibly)

## Missing Persons Connection

### April Bonal Case (Session 32-33)
**Pattern Discovered**:
- April Bonal last seen at Doomfall concert
- Missing persons Casey Bones, Bernardo, others
- All connected to synthesis lab experiments
- Some became ravers, others experimented on
- Overlap between ravers and missing persons

### Chalk Rock's Investigation
- Detective investigating raver-connected disappearances
- Friends searching for missing ravers
- Scale of problem revealed through investigation
- Some ravers living underground voluntarily

## Societal Impact

### High Forge Underground
**Cultural Phenomenon**:
- Massive underground party scene
- Thousands participating or influenced
- Economic impact (V trade, venues)
- Families losing children to movement
- Social disruption on large scale

### Resource Drain
- V supply exhaustion
- Iron Claws exploitation
- Resistance headquarters endangered by proximity
- Police resources investigating disappearances

## Current Threat Level

### Immediate Dangers
- **Numbers**: Thousands under control
- **Ach'uk's Power**: Ancient entity directing them
- **Unpredictability**: Post-Iron Claws goals unclear
- **Violence Potential**: Could turn destructive
- **Influence Spread**: More could be affected

### Long-term Concerns
- **Permanent Damage**: Withdrawal possible but difficult
- **Ach'uk's Goals**: Ultimate plan unknown
- **Containment**: Hard to control thousands
- **Escalation**: Could worsen significantly
- **Rescue**: Helisanna may be unreachable

## Relationship with Other Factions

### Iron Claws (Ended)
- Temporary alliance for Great Hall attack
- Drug supply relationship
- Both benefited from arrangement
- Status post-Helja's death unclear

### Resistance
- Complicated relationship
- Ravers near headquarters problematic
- Potential allies if freed from control
- Currently more threat than help

### Taco Cat
- Created by their band member (Helisanna)
- Personal responsibility felt
- Want to save ravers if possible
- Not strong enough to confront directly

## Recovery Possibility

### Breaking Control
**Requirements**:
- Sever Ach'uk's connection to Helisanna
- Save or defeat Helisanna
- Provide detox support for thousands
- Time and resources for recovery
- Prevent re-influence

### Challenges
- Scale (thousands affected)
- Power source (ancient primordial entity)
- Voluntary participation (they enjoy experience)
- Resource requirements (support systems)
- Ach'uk's ongoing influence

## Future Implications

### Potential Storylines
- Quest to free ravers from control
- Confrontation with Ach'uk through ravers
- Rescue mission for Helisanna
- Management of recovering ravers
- Prevention of future influence

### Campaign Stakes
- Thousands of lives in balance
- Helisanna's soul/identity
- City's stability threatened
- Cosmic entity's foothold in realm
- Party's responsibility for creation

## Significance

### To Campaign
- Personal stakes (Helisanna created them)
- Massive scale threat (thousands)
- Cosmic horror elements
- Moral complexity (victims not villains)
- Long-term consequence of warlock pact

### To Themes
- **Influence vs. Free Will**: Mind control disguised as fandom
- **Responsibility**: Creating problems through power
- **Addiction**: Supernatural dependency parallels
- **Music's Power**: Art as control mechanism
- **Consequences**: Warlock pacts affect everyone
