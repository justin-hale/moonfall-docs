# Skyhammer Clan

*Goliath Tribe • Ancient Bloodline • Starship Guardians*

## Overview

The **Skyhammer Clan** is an ancient Goliath tribe living on **Grimvar's Spine** mountain. They possess unique magical abilities connected to their bloodline, including the power to operate an ancient starship. Red (Thurnok Skyhammer) is the lost prince of this clan, hidden by Twilight Company to protect him from the Eldoran Empire.
