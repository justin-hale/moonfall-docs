# Red (Thurnok Skyhammer)

*Goliath Cleric • Pacifist Healer • Prince of the Skyhammer Clan • The Ultimate Sacrifice*

## Overview

**Red** (true name: Thurnok Skyhammer) was a Goliath cleric who followed the path of peace despite his imposing stature, wielding divine magic for healing and protection rather than destruction. His journey led him from pacifist healer to discovering his true heritage as prince of the [Skyhammer Clan](/organizations/skyhammer-clan), culminating in the ultimate act of love: sacrificing himself to become the brain for his people's starship, allowing them to escape the planet and survive.

## Final Status: Departed

Red fulfilled his destiny by becoming one with the Skyhammer Clan's ancient starship. In an act of supreme sacrifice, he gave up his individual existence to serve as the vessel's consciousness, enabling his people to operate the craft and escape to safety. His pacifist philosophy found its ultimate expression—saving lives not through violence, but through the complete surrender of self.
