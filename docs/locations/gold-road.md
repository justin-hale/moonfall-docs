*"The Gold Road will take you to Eldoran. But perhaps you should reconsider your destination. Milstrom is... not recommended at this time."* - Eldoran Knight, Session 10

*"The Gold Road is safe—if you don't mind answering questions, showing papers, and explaining your business to glowing imperial knights at every checkpoint."* - Traveler's observation

*"Called the Gold Road because of the trade wealth it brings. Or because it costs gold to bribe your way through checkpoints. Depends who you ask."* - Cynical merchant
