# Milstrom

*Forbidden Location • Eldoran Warning • Unknown Danger*

## Overview

**Milstrom** is a mysterious location that the party was strongly warned against visiting by [Eldoran Empire](/organizations/eldoran-empire) knights at a [Gold Road](/locations/gold-road) checkpoint during Session 10. The specific nature of the danger or why the empire doesn't want people going there remains unknown, making it a tantalizing mystery in the campaign.

## Location
