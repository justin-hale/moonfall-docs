# Welcome to Moonfall Sessions

*A D&D Campaign Documentation Site*

Welcome to the official documentation for our **Moonfall** D&D campaign! Here you'll find detailed session summaries and all the memorable moments from our ongoing adventure in the city of High Forge and beyond.

Our party of unlikely heroesâ€”a metal band turned adventurersâ€”navigate a world of underground racing, dwarven politics, magical heists, and interdimensional mysteries.

## The Party

Meet the members of Taco Cat, the adventuring party whose exploits are chronicled in these sessions:

- **Ohma Kapua** â€“ A tortle monk and underground wrestling champion known as "the Ninja Turtle." Ohma joined the party in Session 26 after a spectacular wrestling victory where he recognized Silas and Bru from their shared wrestling careers. His shell bears ancient curse markings of mysterious origin, and he serves as a patient mentor to his devoted student Litu while demonstrating devastating martial arts prowess in combat. Member of a monastic order alongside fellow monk Beonardo, Ohma combines tactical thinking with brutal efficiency, expertly guiding the party through High Forge's sewer systems and making ruthlessly pragmatic decisions in battle. The contrast between his gentle teaching style and aggressive fighting approach makes him one of the party's most versatile members.

- **Leliana Goldspring** â€“ A cheerful, nature-loving bard who emerged as a separate being from Helisanna in Session 34. She represents the original optimistic personality that was trapped inside Helisanna's consciousness for years after refusing to accept the warlock pact with Ach'uk. With blonde hair, a sunny disposition, and endearing verbal tics like "Oh jeez!" and constant apologies, Leliana serves as the party's emotional heart. Her bardic magic focuses on healing allies (healing word), controlling crowds (hypnotic pattern), and empowering companions (mantle of inspiration). Despite her gentle nature, she demonstrates pragmatic wisdom, choosing to stay with "the people who aren't trying to murder each other" even while heartbroken about Helisanna's fate. Her natural charisma and genuine kindness open doors that force cannot, making her invaluable in both social encounters and tactical combat support.

- **Helisanna Doomfall** â€“ A bard/warlock whose electric guitar axe serves as both instrument and weapon in her quest to bring metal music to the masses. As the band's frontwoman, she wields bardic inspiration to rally her allies while channeling eldritch power through her performances. Her guitar axe crackles with electricity as she delivers devastating attacks, and her stage presence commands attention whether she's inspiring courage in combat or leading the party's musical endeavors. Helisanna embodies the fusion of artistic expression and magical might, proving that rock and roll can indeed save the worldâ€”or at least devastate its enemies.

- **Silas Fairbanks** â€“ A halfling rogue whose entrepreneurial spirit drives both legitimate business ventures and questionable schemes. As the band's manager, he balances his duties to Taco Cat with his natural instincts for profit and advancement. His small stature belies his cunning intellect and nimble fingers, equally adept at picking locks, pockets, and investment opportunities. Whether he's negotiating contracts, executing elaborate heists, or scheming his way to the top of Waterdeep's social ladder, Silas approaches every challenge with the calculating mind of a businessman and the quick reflexes of a seasoned rogue.

- **Bru** (Felonias Bru) â€“ A goblin artificer whose chaotic inventions are matched only by his explosive personality and his inseparable companion Kevin, a construct that serves as both friend and collaborative partner. Bru's expertise in pyrotechnics has proven both spectacular and dangerous, from setting butler's coattails ablaze to creating elaborate explosive displays. His goblin nature shines through in his unpredictable approach to problem-solving, often favoring the most chaotic solution available. Together with Kevin, Bru represents the perfect fusion of artificial intelligence and natural chaos, creating ingenious devices that somehow work despiteâ€”or perhaps because ofâ€”their seemingly haphazard construction.

- **Red** â€“ A Goliath cleric who follows the path of peace despite his imposing stature, wielding divine magic for healing and protection rather than destruction. His pacifist beliefs stand in stark contrast to his powerful frame, and he struggles with the moral implications of violence even when defending his friends. Red's Spirit Guardians ability manifests as protective ethereal warriors, and his healing powers have saved the party countless times. His gentle nature and commitment to non-violence make him the party's conscience, though he has learned that sometimes healing others requires confronting those who would cause harm.

- **Retired Detective Olivia Cooper** â€“ A dwarf paladin whose investigative career prepared her well for a life of divine service and adventure. Known throughout the city for her legendary detective work (complete with parades upon her retirement), Olivia brings methodical investigation skills and pointed questioning to every mystery the party encounters. Her paladin abilities prove devastatingly effective against undead and fiends, channeling divine strikes and radiant damage with the same precision she once applied to solving cases. Whether she's examining crime scenes, interrogating suspects, or smiting evil with holy fury, Olivia approaches each challenge with the professional demeanor that made her a celebrated law enforcement officer.

- **Elspeth Cooper** â€“ A dwarven artificer gunslinger whose magical firearms and mechanical companion BoxBox make her a formidable combatant and tactical asset. Her steel defender BoxBox serves as both loyal companion and battlefield coordinator, working in perfect harmony with Elspeth's ranged attacks and utility spells. Whether she's providing covering fire with her magical gun, setting elaborate traps, or using her construction expertise to solve problems, Elspeth combines technical ingenuity with battlefield courage. Her coordination with BoxBox demonstrates the pinnacle of artificer craft, showing how magic and machinery can work together to protect allies and overcome obstacles.
