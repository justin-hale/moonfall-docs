# Welcome to Moonfall Sessions

*A D&D Campaign Documentation Site*

Welcome to the official documentation for our **Moonfall** D&D campaign! Here you'll find detailed session summaries and all the memorable moments from our ongoing adventure in the city of High Forge and beyond.

Our party of unlikely heroesâ€”a metal band turned adventurersâ€”navigate a world of underground racing, dwarven politics, magical heists, and interdimensional mysteries.

## The Party

Meet the members of Taco Cat, the adventuring party whose exploits are chronicled in these sessions:

- **Ohma Kapua** â€“ A tortle monk whose shell bears ancient curse markings and whose past is shrouded in mystery. Once a pirate captain of considerable renown, Ohma's transformation from his previous life remains an enigma. His shell tells a story of battles fought and prices paid, while his martial arts prowess speaks to years of disciplined training. Despite his intimidating appearance and mysterious background, Ohma serves as both the party's moral compass and tactical anchor, often making crucial decisions with wisdom earned through hard experience. His journey from the seas to the monastery to his current adventures represents a search for redemption and understanding of the forces that changed his very nature.

- **Liliana Goldspring** â€“ An entertainer and warlock whose bubbly personality masks a sharp intellect and mysterious patron. Despite her cheerful demeanor and tendency to see the best in people, Liliana possesses formidable eldritch powers that she wields with surprising effectiveness. Her background as a performer serves her well in social situations, where her natural charisma and optimistic outlook often open doors that force cannot. Yet beneath the surface lies a complexity born from her warlock pactâ€”the source of her power remains largely unspoken, though its influence can be seen in moments of surprising darkness or unexpected insight. Her duality as both the party's emotional heart and a wielder of otherworldly magic makes her an essential and fascinating member of the group.

- **Helisanna Doomfall** â€“ A bard/warlock whose electric guitar axe serves as both instrument and weapon in her quest to bring metal music to the masses. As the band's frontwoman, she wields bardic inspiration to rally her allies while channeling eldritch power through her performances. Her guitar axe crackles with electricity as she delivers devastating attacks, and her stage presence commands attention whether she's inspiring courage in combat or leading the party's musical endeavors. Helisanna embodies the fusion of artistic expression and magical might, proving that rock and roll can indeed save the worldâ€”or at least devastate its enemies.

- **Silas Fairbanks** â€“ A halfling rogue whose entrepreneurial spirit drives both legitimate business ventures and questionable schemes. As the band's manager, he balances his duties to Taco Cat with his natural instincts for profit and advancement. His small stature belies his cunning intellect and nimble fingers, equally adept at picking locks, pockets, and investment opportunities. Whether he's negotiating contracts, executing elaborate heists, or scheming his way to the top of Waterdeep's social ladder, Silas approaches every challenge with the calculating mind of a businessman and the quick reflexes of a seasoned rogue.

- **Bru** (Felonias Bru) â€“ A goblin artificer whose chaotic inventions are matched only by his explosive personality and his inseparable companion Kevin, a construct that serves as both friend and collaborative partner. Bru's expertise in pyrotechnics has proven both spectacular and dangerous, from setting butler's coattails ablaze to creating elaborate explosive displays. His goblin nature shines through in his unpredictable approach to problem-solving, often favoring the most chaotic solution available. Together with Kevin, Bru represents the perfect fusion of artificial intelligence and natural chaos, creating ingenious devices that somehow work despiteâ€”or perhaps because ofâ€”their seemingly haphazard construction.

- **Red** â€“ A Goliath cleric who follows the path of peace despite his imposing stature, wielding divine magic for healing and protection rather than destruction. His pacifist beliefs stand in stark contrast to his powerful frame, and he struggles with the moral implications of violence even when defending his friends. Red's Spirit Guardians ability manifests as protective ethereal warriors, and his healing powers have saved the party countless times. His gentle nature and commitment to non-violence make him the party's conscience, though he has learned that sometimes healing others requires confronting those who would cause harm.

- **Retired Detective Olivia Cooper** â€“ A dwarf paladin whose investigative career prepared her well for a life of divine service and adventure. Known throughout the city for her legendary detective work (complete with parades upon her retirement), Olivia brings methodical investigation skills and pointed questioning to every mystery the party encounters. Her paladin abilities prove devastatingly effective against undead and fiends, channeling divine strikes and radiant damage with the same precision she once applied to solving cases. Whether she's examining crime scenes, interrogating suspects, or smiting evil with holy fury, Olivia approaches each challenge with the professional demeanor that made her a celebrated law enforcement officer.

- **Elspeth Cooper** â€“ A dwarven artificer gunslinger whose magical firearms and mechanical companion BoxBox make her a formidable combatant and tactical asset. Her steel defender BoxBox serves as both loyal companion and battlefield coordinator, working in perfect harmony with Elspeth's ranged attacks and utility spells. Whether she's providing covering fire with her magical gun, setting elaborate traps, or using her construction expertise to solve problems, Elspeth combines technical ingenuity with battlefield courage. Her coordination with BoxBox demonstrates the pinnacle of artificer craft, showing how magic and machinery can work together to protect allies and overcome obstacles.
