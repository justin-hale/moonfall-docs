**Walden Briarhelm:** Big

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh s***, that's being

**Christopher Hooper:** You are being

**Luke Neverisky:** recorded. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** roll.

**Christopher Hooper:** recorded. Hello everybody. How's it

**Walden Briarhelm:** Heyer, how's Papa toe

**Luke Neverisky:** consent off the

**Christopher Hooper:** going? I'm doing

**Tyram:** Don't call him that

**Walden Briarhelm:** doing? No, we don't. We don't like

**Christopher Hooper:** well. I'm big

**Tyram:** again. God damn it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. Do we prefer big

**Luke Neverisky:** toe. What's that calling that

**Christopher Hooper:** papa. Zack, how

**Walden Briarhelm:** papa? She's doing I would I mean

**Christopher Hooper:** is your

**Walden Briarhelm:** given everything I'd say she's doing very well. Uh

**Luke Neverisky:** again?

**Christopher Hooper:** wife?

**Walden Briarhelm:** the surgery was successful. It was uh as minimally invasive as possible and she paid for

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the uh ACL reconstruction.

**Christopher Hooper:** What? What? What was the surgery again?

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, she landed funky on her leg and popped her

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** ACL, which is unfortunately common and not a very fun recovery.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. Yeah. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, so she's Oh, yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** play a lot of soccer and people like wreck their ACL all the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Soccer is uh real familiar with it then. Yeah. You you get it

**Christopher Hooper:** time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** and they put you in the brace where you're basically just stuck in it for a while. Yep. So, it's been a

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** challenging lots of interesting uh new experiences, but so far she's done well. We got to a point

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like that one

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, go

**Christopher Hooper:** as like a person is like just outsidesly like debilitating for like the you know what it the surgery and everything it is just

**Walden Briarhelm:** ahead. Right. That's I

**Christopher Hooper:** because like it means you can't

**Walden Briarhelm:** mean that's exactly how we felt about it. It was like you you need

**Christopher Hooper:** walk.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to you're you have to be able to move. So that was a choice and so far like out of pocket

**Luke Neverisky:** See?

**Walden Briarhelm:** expenses has been fairly impressive. I'm very impressed with how cheap things have come out considering what you

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, no big

**Walden Briarhelm:** see. Well, I mean uh so far separate bills have been less than a thousand each. That always feels good. They might add up to a few

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** deal. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** thousand, but like that's pretty good. I'll take

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Are they like

**Walden Briarhelm:** that. I don't

**Luke Neverisky:** Dang.

**Christopher Hooper:** spoon feeding it to you right now? One a lot of

**Walden Briarhelm:** know. Yeah, probably. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** They boiled frog you

**Christopher Hooper:** times.

**Ellis Taylor:** Get out of

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, exactly.

**Ellis Taylor:** here.

**Tyram:** Hey. Oh, I got that uh that video game uh Claire

**Walden Briarhelm:** the overall just doing

**Tyram:** Obscurer Expedition

**Walden Briarhelm:** well. Who tell

**Luke Neverisky:** know. Oh yeah. You

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Have you been playing

**Tyram:** 33. Um I've only like beat the first boss. Like

**Luke Neverisky:** want that

**Christopher Hooper:** it?

**Tyram:** I haven't had much time to play it during the week here, but it Yeah, I can see what all the hype is about. It's

**Luke Neverisky:** correct?

**Tyram:** uh seems to be very well written and it's got a very interesting premise.

**Luke Neverisky:** It

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I would say it's it's interesting cuz the like combat and like gameplay itself is just, you know, kind of whatever.

**Tyram:** So

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, but it is all about like the style and the story and

**Tyram:** yeah, although I do like how I can start every

**Walden Briarhelm:** us?

**Tyram:** encounter by just like take standing there for a second just shooting everyone in the

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Luke Neverisky:** was Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. I That's exactly how I started

**Tyram:** face.

**Christopher Hooper:** too with like, oh, I'm gonna just have my builds where I just shoot

**Tyram:** Well, I mean like you get the points back and you know if you can do some free damage, why not? Especially because some

**Christopher Hooper:** everyone. Yeah.

**Tyram:** enemies like you kind of have to anyway. But

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** It does make it where it's nice to have at least like one person in the party that

**Luke Neverisky:** There is a

**Christopher Hooper:** just shoots

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** specific like machine gun build for a character and it's basically

**Christopher Hooper:** everyone. Oh, really? That sounds

**Tyram:** I'm

**Walden Briarhelm:** Is this only on PC or can I play this on a

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** playing it on PS5. So

**Walden Briarhelm:** console? Nice. That

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** is I've I'm I'm really torn. I think I'm ready to make the jump back. I don't want to have to update to Windows 11 and I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** fun.

**Walden Briarhelm:** really The only reason I have my PC is to play games. So, I was like, why don't

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Tyram:** yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I just get a console? But I don't know what I should get between an Xbox and a

**Luke Neverisky:** I will say like a yeah PS5 especially

**Christopher Hooper:** We get a

**Luke Neverisky:** because like Game Pass just hikes up their prices to 30 bucks a month or PS

**Christopher Hooper:** PS.

**Tyram:** I got a PS5

**Walden Briarhelm:** PS5. Oh, for how

**Luke Neverisky:** now is still 15 if

**Tyram:** so I could play Spider-Man. So like I still just like wait until like

**Walden Briarhelm:** long?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** hey here's a game I really want and then that usually is how I make my console

**Luke Neverisky:** that What

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. What is the I Spider-Man obviously and the

**Luke Neverisky:** do you

**Tyram:** choice.

**Walden Briarhelm:** sequel, but what are uh what are some other PS5 titles you would

**Tyram:** Uh, I like the Final Fantasy remake things, although that is that's not something I would say is

**Walden Briarhelm:** suggest? That

**Tyram:** like fit for everyone. Like I enjoy like terrible

**Luke Neverisky:** think?

**Tyram:** grinds. So like, you

**Walden Briarhelm:** one original seven.

**Luke Neverisky:** That is a terrible grind.

**Tyram:** know, Yeah. I'm like usually like

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I get

**Tyram:** with movies and video games and everything like it's like you know like oh it takes so much so long and so grinding and like usually I'm okay with it but I will say I felt every minute of the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth uh level up grind it I

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** What?

**Tyram:** was ready for that game to be over when it was over

**Walden Briarhelm:** I watched some people I watched a few

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** streamers play it and was like, I get the gist. It's definitely not

**Tyram:** but

**Walden Briarhelm:** the ex it's a a retelling for sure. I like the word

**Tyram:** Oh not really no um that's actually I think the interesting thing about it

**Walden Briarhelm:** rebirth. Like how it plays is

**Tyram:** is that it's bas it seems like there it's a

**Walden Briarhelm:** very interesting.

**Tyram:** time loop like you are not just doing the same game over again you are changing key moments because like Erit like inner consciousness back in time the game's been out for like six f****** years so I don't feel bad about but

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. No,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** yeah but yeah but no um

**Walden Briarhelm:** that's a spoiler for

**Luke Neverisky:** Totally. For

**Tyram:** but they're being very

**Luke Neverisky:** our fan

**Tyram:** like nonforthcoming about it, but like I think it's pretty clear that that's what's happening is like it's not just a retelling.

**Luke Neverisky:** base.

**Tyram:** It's key moments very conspicuously are being changed. But

**Walden Briarhelm:** sure.

**Tyram:** yeah. Oh, hey Martha. Did you ever talk to Toeer about

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I didn't. But I was just looking at them

**Tyram:** origin

**Ellis Taylor:** because I forgot about that. Toeer or Toeer

**Tyram:** feed?

**Ellis Taylor:** Taylor said that he didn't think that I had an origin feet on

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, that's quite possible because you really

**Ellis Taylor:** there. my

**Christopher Hooper:** f***** up your uh transition to your transition to the updated rule set. I would

**Ellis Taylor:** character.

**Christopher Hooper:** imagine uh may have involved forgetting your origin

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** fee. I can take a look. Your internet is garbage right now, Ellis.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** So there

**Christopher Hooper:** garbage. So, you need to take

**Tyram:** Is she

**Christopher Hooper:** that internet back out and show it

**Ellis Taylor:** there. Okay,

**Tyram:** still here? There she

**Luke Neverisky:** it's

**Ellis Taylor:** everyone froze for me for a second. What did you

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Christopher Hooper:** something. Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** say? No, it's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** we were talking about how your internet's garbage.

**Ellis Taylor:** not. His face is

**Christopher Hooper:** You literally just proved it.

**Ellis Taylor:** garbage.

**Tyram:** is.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um, so I'm gonna I'm going to put you on blast by presenting me and your character character builder right now. All right.

**Ellis Taylor:** What is this? I can't see

**Christopher Hooper:** So, you're missing

**Luke Neverisky:** that your internet sucks.

**Christopher Hooper:** this. You can't see

**Ellis Taylor:** anything. What is all that

**Tyram:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** anything. It's on DND

**Ellis Taylor:** stuff? All right, I blame

**Tyram:** easier if she could she could just add an origin fee without doing the rest of it if that's

**Christopher Hooper:** Beyond.

**Ellis Taylor:** trying. Where is

**Tyram:** all if that would be easier.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Does Liliana have the

**Christopher Hooper:** origin

**Walden Briarhelm:** fa touch

**Luke Neverisky:** He just not or I didn't

**Christopher Hooper:** feet. Oh, let's see. Is that the Oh, it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** tattoo?

**Luke Neverisky:** give

**Christopher Hooper:** this. Is Is that what you're talking about,

**Ellis Taylor:** that?

**Tyram:** Um, yeah, I guess so. Um, if she just goes to like add

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor?

**Tyram:** feeds like we did earlier when you just gave us a free feed. I saw the origin feats were in there if you just wanted to do that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Let

**Luke Neverisky:** It's like manage.

**Christopher Hooper:** me see. How

**Ellis Taylor:** I know. That's what

**Christopher Hooper:** did How does she know if she has her origin feet, though? Do you

**Ellis Taylor:** I was trying to figure out. It didn't

**Tyram:** I just looked and she didn't have one. This got

**Ellis Taylor:** like feel like it didn't prompt me to add

**Tyram:** started when like uh she was like, "Do you have any feed recommendations?" And I like went and

**Ellis Taylor:** one.

**Tyram:** looked. I like, "Okay, I want to see what she already has. I don't recommend something she already has." And I

**Christopher Hooper:** know?

**Tyram:** thought, "Oh, she doesn't have an origin feat." So, if you just go to her character sheet and like go to the feats, I think you just add the feet. You don't have to do the rest of

**Luke Neverisky:** Crazy. I can take this.

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't have to do the rest of

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, I just did that

**Tyram:** it. Like yeah, I mean you're going to manage

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** it,

**Ellis Taylor:** under feeds. I added lucky, but I was trying to figure out like I

**Tyram:** feeding. Oh, okay. Never mind.

**Ellis Taylor:** didn't see anything prompting

**Tyram:** I guess

**Ellis Taylor:** me

**Tyram:** you're Yeah, you're using the old background

**Christopher Hooper:** but

**Tyram:** stuff which didn't have origin feats. So yeah, Lucky is really good though.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, let me just uh pick up

**Luke Neverisky:** don't

**Christopher Hooper:** Lucky. Oh, I guess I'll just pick up Lucky

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** then. Um, cool. It looks like um no one but

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Ellis uh leveled up to

**Tyram:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** eight.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Justin Hale:** All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** Let's see. Who am I missing? I'm

**Tyram:** did. Yeah. So, who

**Luke Neverisky:** did.

**Christopher Hooper:** missing Helisana, who's dead, and El

**Tyram:** cares? He's not here.

**Christopher Hooper:** Smith, who's not here. All right. All right. Well, then never

**Tyram:** Well, I I I mean, I'm waiting for the apology,

**Walden Briarhelm:** tried.

**Justin Hale:** What I'm what I'm hearing


### [00:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** mind. You'll never get it. Not for

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh my

**Justin Hale:** is

**Christopher Hooper:** me. Um, I guess I'll deactivate

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I think

**Christopher Hooper:** Hana or at least delete her.

**Ellis Taylor:** god.

**Luke Neverisky:** so. You can have it delete

**Ellis Taylor:** Hold on,

**Tyram:** but I mean, Helis was part of the gang for a while. I feel like she deserves her place

**Luke Neverisky:** me.

**Tyram:** in the in the fallen heroes uh thing there at the

**Justin Hale:** everybody

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey.

**Tyram:** bottom, you know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** As a quick review where we left

**Ellis Taylor:** Mr.

**Walden Briarhelm:** off, the gang is still very much in a confusion about who this new person

**Tyram:** To my knowledge, we're still hanging out at the battlefield. We haven't even

**Walden Briarhelm:** is,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** like gone else

**Walden Briarhelm:** right? Everybody's just like, "So, what are

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** we looking at exactly?" And kind of piecing it together.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sounds like there's part of the

**Christopher Hooper:** So, anyone want to give a um recap of what

**Tyram:** yet.

**Luke Neverisky:** another again. All

**Christopher Hooper:** happened? Okay, go

**Luke Neverisky:** right. So, crying one

**Walden Briarhelm:** picture.

**Luke Neverisky:** was being a b**** and uh really really strong and hurting everyone and all his minions uh were f****** us up.

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um um we were definitely spread really thin um amongst the ravers and praying one and then um and then patrons started to get involved and wreck her s***. Um and uh she started blasting her teammates because the patron was assuming direct control if you know the reference. And uh uh let's see what

**Christopher Hooper:** Your bases belong to

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh uh

**Luke Neverisky:** else.

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh to be clear, you you

**Luke Neverisky:** Um so battle ensued and then somebody had a stroke

**Walden Briarhelm:** attacked Ma several times. And the re

**Luke Neverisky:** of I did. I

**Christopher Hooper:** me.

**Walden Briarhelm:** listening, it was amazing how many times you ended up having to shoot

**Luke Neverisky:** rolled a

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it with a

**Christopher Hooper:** Honestly, with in hindsight, I shouldn't have even let you attack because Ma had

**Luke Neverisky:** D6. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** become enthralled and thus was on your side.

**Walden Briarhelm:** blast. Worked out

**Christopher Hooper:** But I realized that an hour after

**Walden Briarhelm:** well.

**Luke Neverisky:** true. Um, so then the fight ensued and then someone had the stroke of genius. I think it was was

**Christopher Hooper:** session

**Luke Neverisky:** it uh Ellsworth? I think someone had the idea to

**Tyram:** uh that was a brew I

**Luke Neverisky:** cast shatter on the speakers

**Christopher Hooper:** That was Brew. Ellsworth was definitely focused on the speakers, which I thought was great. But yeah, Brew then then once he got

**Tyram:** believe.

**Luke Neverisky:** which we

**Christopher Hooper:** focused, he started making

**Luke Neverisky:** started making business and um they put the speakers in a weakened state and then Silus who had his intelligence drains to basically drooling on the floor Um yeah

**Christopher Hooper:** business one,

**Ellis Taylor:** It's

**Luke Neverisky:** um he stumbled on over to uh speaker lands a finishing

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Luke Neverisky:** blow which um was a great move. Um but not before um Alisana was basically killed and went into some weird inner dialogue thing with the uh we learned to be Lana who was uh Alisana her before she became Ellis. Um, and then just when things looked really dire and uh people were getting downed left and right, this f****** manifestation of tear comes in and uh springs Liliana and Alison loose from this like inner mind prison thing. Uh, and then

**Ellis Taylor:** It's coming back.

**Luke Neverisky:** um the battle seems to be over after that and the ravers carried Hana off and was like, I got this s***. Don't worry, guys. And um presumably they're going to go party and do some things and probably probably avoid war against Belgia. Uh we go um that sound

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Luke Neverisky:** right? What did I

**Christopher Hooper:** think so. I think that

**Luke Neverisky:** miss? All right,

**Christopher Hooper:** that's most of it. Um, any any other details anyone else

**Tyram:** Um, I guess it's

**Luke Neverisky:** cool.

**Tyram:** worth pointing out that Crang one is still alive. Like we never actually beat them.

**Luke Neverisky:** That just

**Christopher Hooper:** noticed? It's true.

**Justin Hale:** And he threw a little

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** for a little

**Justin Hale:** fit when we blew up his

**Christopher Hooper:** so, um, yeah, he's really mad. This is his nightclub and he's a little

**Tyram:** I mean, you should probably also be mad that like Helisana is like the new teacher's pet, it

**Christopher Hooper:** baby. Yeah, I guess he should be cring, too.

**Tyram:** seems. What a

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, honestly.

**Justin Hale:** Does that mean Helisan is cring one

**Tyram:** loser.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Look at me. I'm great now.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think so. Helisana crank

**Justin Hale:** though?

**Christopher Hooper:** one. And before your eyes, Helisana turns into a giant

**Tyram:** I guess before we like get into the like RP and everything, um I just wanted to ask you Luke, um do you want us to try to save Helisana or are you done with the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** baby. Oh, such a great

**Luke Neverisky:** So, such a great question. Um, I was thinking about it

**Christopher Hooper:** question.

**Tyram:** character?

**Luke Neverisky:** and uh it's like really hard to shift personas mid uh mid session and like go from Helisana to not Helisana. So I've had some time to think on it. Um so yes, so I've given it some thought as far as like through Liliana's lenses and lens. Um and I think that she will have seen and noticed that Alisana does indeed or has some shredder does care about the park and so therefore she is worth attempting to

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, that is uh good

**Luke Neverisky:** save.

**Tyram:** to know for our planning of what to do next. Um, and honestly, I love the idea of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. What is the

**Tyram:** creating like baby metal uh Liliana

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. We

**Ellis Taylor:** definition of safe? Is it bringing them back together? Is it letting them be

**Tyram:** like

**Luke Neverisky:** can make Baby

**Ellis Taylor:** their own people?

**Luke Neverisky:** Metal. I don't know. But it seems I mean right now she's like # dead

**Christopher Hooper:** and

**Ellis Taylor:** Like

**Luke Neverisky:** or partially or something. patron did something s***** to her. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** heat.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Well, actually that was another question from last

**Luke Neverisky:** whether it's her, I don't know,

**Tyram:** week that um might be worth knowing.

**Luke Neverisky:** but

**Tyram:** Um, are Helisana and Liliana incomplete parts of the same person or are they like they're each their own full actualized person at this

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, all

**Luke Neverisky:** I sure can.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Luke, can you answer

**Luke Neverisky:** Um so yeah um

**Christopher Hooper:** this?

**Tyram:** point?

**Luke Neverisky:** the the idea is that um Liliana was like um basically thinking about the time when um uh basically Liliana is a manifestation of um um of what she was prior. So she is her own person created

**Ellis Taylor:** First of all,

**Luke Neverisky:** from um basically as a means of like anchoring herself to what she was if that makes sense. uh she went through some drastic change and um Oiana is like the you know part of herself kind of that uh she left behind

**Ellis Taylor:** might be

**Luke Neverisky:** and so I don't know it's kind of like a I don't know would you call it like a

**Ellis Taylor:** right. You believe

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, let me look

**Ellis Taylor:** me?

**Christopher Hooper:** up exactly what faximile

**Luke Neverisky:** faximile yeah

**Justin Hale:** It's when you send a fax.

**Christopher Hooper:** means.

**Ellis Taylor:** with with a simile written on

**Luke Neverisky:** she backed herself

**Christopher Hooper:** Um so uh so um basically the uh

**Tyram:** Please

**Christopher Hooper:** Helisana would keep thinking to herself like what would hap have happened if

**Ellis Taylor:** it. You should

**Tyram:** watch.

**Christopher Hooper:** she didn't do what she did to meet her patron

**Ellis Taylor:** not go

**Christopher Hooper:** originally and eventually that idea grew into its own being inside her her head and it became so strong mixed with all the other uh warlock magic going on that it became a a fully separate entity, an entity that was her if she had never gone um to meet her patron. And so

**Ellis Taylor:** Circus.

**Christopher Hooper:** yes, they are fully separate.

**Ellis Taylor:** So it's like

**Christopher Hooper:** um

**Ellis Taylor:** severance basically to some

**Christopher Hooper:** entities.

**Ellis Taylor:** degree. Well, I mean

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh no, not really

**Ellis Taylor:** like well it's like a fully separate being that was occupying the same bodies just now that they're split in

**Christopher Hooper:** because it's like severance

**Ellis Taylor:** two.

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** if um they became two different

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. I mean they are two different people in so

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** people and like

**Ellis Taylor:** just in the same

**Walden Briarhelm:** Feeling like this is like Majin Buu.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, but they like have different they have

**Ellis Taylor:** body.

**Christopher Hooper:** different bodies and like

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. So, they each have a different driver

**Christopher Hooper:** um Yeah, the

**Luke Neverisky:** blade.

**Christopher Hooper:** innie the innie still has memories of before they were an innie.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I don't know if it got a clear answer last time. So, I wanted to bring up a question that I think Taylor asked in the middle of the uh combat and it was or in the decision-making. It was uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Nice. Nice.

**Walden Briarhelm:** is the Helisana part that has left the scene currently. Is she like a murderous version of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh


### [00:20:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** Helisana? because we've seen

**Ellis Taylor:** my god. Look at

**Walden Briarhelm:** Helisana uh Unchained or however we want to describe that and she was like I'll attack part or I'll attack my allies and murders on the table etc. Like is that what this Helisana is

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, what do

**Ellis Taylor:** this.

**Luke Neverisky:** Sorry, I was taking a

**Christopher Hooper:** you think,

**Walden Briarhelm:** about?

**Luke Neverisky:** drink. Um, so I think that is like trying to think of an analogy here. It's like her warlock patron got cranked up to 11 uh in a moment

**Christopher Hooper:** Luke?

**Luke Neverisky:** of, you know, like I was almost dead. She was almost dead. And so I think that was an opportune moment for the patron to again assume direct control. Um, like we saw we saw earlier that like it had attempted to make me like try to shoot Silus or something, but I was resisting. Um, so I'm assuming that this

**Ellis Taylor:** What

**Luke Neverisky:** is like, you know, can almost

**Ellis Taylor:** you got?

**Luke Neverisky:** like I don't know, possession or something. Um, but I would say this is like more like basic 3 to 11

**Christopher Hooper:** And one

**Luke Neverisky:** basically.

**Christopher Hooper:** aspect is uh Helisana always had Liliana in her consciousness like to bounce ideas off of and she no longer has that with

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. What is it?

**Christopher Hooper:** her. Um so maybe there were times where

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Liliana talked her into something one way or

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Sure. She was born out of like Yeah. angering,

**Tyram:** Okay. So, she's like a she's like a

**Walden Briarhelm:** So

**Luke Neverisky:** grounding, whatever.

**Christopher Hooper:** another.

**Tyram:** hide without a jackal at this point,

**Walden Briarhelm:** some that's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

**Tyram:** maybe. All right. So

**Walden Briarhelm:** perfect. Uh if

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is perfect

**Tyram:** I guess like as like like the bottom line question I guess is

**Walden Briarhelm:** if you had to pick a

**Tyram:** this like do you want us to save Helana or can Helana even be

**Luke Neverisky:** actually. I don't know the answer to the the can be, but I think if I were to role play and think about it, I think that my character would want to try something to salvage

**Tyram:** saved? Okay. Well, I guess that that would be a good uh thing for us to

**Luke Neverisky:** her and

**Tyram:** have a conversation about in character then.

**Ellis Taylor:** What about the United

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I will say, um, I think your characters

**Ellis Taylor:** States?

**Christopher Hooper:** would grasp this, but a, um, just a like mono ammono, like your team versus Helisana. um a direct confrontation

**Luke Neverisky:** f******

**Christopher Hooper:** would not go well. Um so you you might have like I I think maybe short term there might be you know some deals you could make to at least like avoid

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, stop.

**Christopher Hooper:** catastrophe and and push this till later and

**Ellis Taylor:** Help me

**Christopher Hooper:** plant seeds. Um maybe there are some like clever things you could do to like still get some aims without confrontation. Um, and feel free to be clever, but I think if you just like go and try to beat the s*** out of Helisana, you will uh you will uh Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** please.

**Tyram:** Well, that's why we have to channel

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** exactly. Yeah,

**Tyram:** the power of

**Walden Briarhelm:** freezing.

**Christopher Hooper:** exactly. Um, yeah, that's a great idea. Uh, it's one Luke also floated, which I love. Um, and that is a quest that, uh, you

**Tyram:** Joel. I originally was

**Christopher Hooper:** all should seek further down the line.

**Tyram:** thinking Lenny T, but I'm like would never go for that.

**Christopher Hooper:** I was reading through the whole whole paragraph expecting the last line to be Lenny T and was was pleased

**Ellis Taylor:** Oops.

**Justin Hale:** As was I when you said Joel, I

**Tyram:** My first thought was Lenny T, but then I'm

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Justin Hale:** was visibly

**Tyram:** like, Toeer cannot in good

**Ellis Taylor:** Is

**Tyram:** conscience not put glaze on Joel here, you

**Christopher Hooper:** pleased

**Tyram:** know? All

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't know if you've seen my track record. I'm just as likely to kill Joel as as help you.

**Justin Hale:** upset.

**Christopher Hooper:** So,

**Ellis Taylor:** your welcome?

**Christopher Hooper:** but um but I still love the idea. Um and it's probably something that you can explore in

**Luke Neverisky:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** Greyport where Joel was last seen alive.

**Ellis Taylor:** Watch your

**Christopher Hooper:** Um amongst other things. So, or you could go

**Tyram:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** to his hometown or you could visit his friends. I think these are all good avenues uh going forward. Um but that is all in the future. Something to think about

**Ellis Taylor:** heart.

**Tyram:** All right. Well, then we I guess in the short term then we

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah.

**Justin Hale:** No, we're doing it

**Christopher Hooper:** later. Let's talk

**Ellis Taylor:** Thank

**Tyram:** need to Okay. So, three things

**Justin Hale:** now.

**Tyram:** that could burn down High Forge, I guess, that we got to deal with.

**Ellis Taylor:** you.

**Tyram:** Uh, one is the Iron Claws. We already have

**Christopher Hooper:** about

**Tyram:** the like converging army plan to take care of them. So

**Ellis Taylor:** Stupid

**Tyram:** let's I guess for now let's assume we can manage to do that. Um then we have the

**Luke Neverisky:** yet.

**Christopher Hooper:** you to that point I think you are beginning to have the piece of puzzle pieces together that like uh the ironclaws are currently the scaffolding that's keeping this city like together

**Tyram:** dragons.

**Christopher Hooper:** in a really f***** up way in their like f***** up way. Um, and so basically if you remove that scaffolding, you you need to put something else in in there to

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** makes

**Christopher Hooper:** replace

**Tyram:** Um, is Olivia Cooper so well loved amongst the population that she could like stabilize the the populace for the short

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Yeah, let's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, you just want to drop me off

**Tyram:** term? I don't know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** You're

**Christopher Hooper:** lose another

**Ellis Taylor:** behind.

**Tyram:** Actually, my thought was actually that uh Silas

**Christopher Hooper:** character.

**Tyram:** calls in his girlfriend to like manage the city because if she can deal

**Luke Neverisky:** sense.

**Tyram:** with um with

**Walden Briarhelm:** iron.

**Tyram:** uh oh god, what was his name? The the s******* who runs the casino um who's like the descendant of the other s******* that grew the giant

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, I don't know. I didn't take any notes during that

**Tyram:** chicken. But if she can deal with that guy, she can manage a city. So,

**Ellis Taylor:** Marvin. Marvin. Junior.

**Tyram:** like actually was my thought on that. That's it. Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** session.

**Ellis Taylor:** Junior. Junior.

**Tyram:** Marvin. Yeah, I made up the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, Marvin. All

**Tyram:** name Marvin originally, but I you have kept that character

**Christopher Hooper:** right. You still got

**Tyram:** alive far longer than he's been alive in my

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Junior. You stuck

**Tyram:** mind. But, um, yeah. Anyway, um, okay. So I guess yeah, we need to think about like who feels the

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Tyram:** who fills the power vacuum, but we also got to deal with the dragons

**Ellis Taylor:** out.

**Tyram:** and the ravers.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, dragons are

**Tyram:** So the dragons, we do have like a

**Luke Neverisky:** out. What? Two days

**Tyram:** Hail Mary we can throw with the orb. We have not tried to use it yet. Apparently every time we do try to use it, it could potentially be bad. But after they take care of the iron

**Luke Neverisky:** out.

**Tyram:** claws, like we could try to use the orb to be like, "Okay, dragons, go away." And

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Tyram:** just like order them to like go back where they came

**Luke Neverisky:** That is a panic

**Tyram:** from. I can't think of anything else we could

**Luke Neverisky:** button for sure that we can pull.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, take it

**Tyram:** possibly do to overcome an army of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** back.

**Tyram:** dragons.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I will I will float. Um, are the dragons your

**Tyram:** I mean, we got off to

**Luke Neverisky:** agree. I mean, they have our Bugatti,

**Tyram:** a bad start. That's for damn sure. They were like nuking the city as

**Luke Neverisky:** so

**Christopher Hooper:** enemy?

**Tyram:** we were running away from it. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** True. It's

**Tyram:** So, I want to call them our

**Justin Hale:** If we gave them my Bugatti and they're still our

**Luke Neverisky:** There's

**Justin Hale:** enemies, we're torching this

**Christopher Hooper:** true. I think y'all are I think in in their book y'all are fairly

**Ellis Taylor:** Hello.

**Tyram:** friends.

**Luke Neverisky:** no Oh, well. All right

**Justin Hale:** place. I mean, we gave him a

**Ellis Taylor:** Hello.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh

**Luke Neverisky:** then.

**Justin Hale:** million dollar car. We better

**Christopher Hooper:** chill. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Oh, and then we also have to deal with

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***.

**Justin Hale:** chill.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so

**Tyram:** the ravers, which maybe we can like

**Christopher Hooper:** just just tossing that out there. Just tossing that

**Tyram:** convince Helisana to take the ravers somewhere

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Tyram:** else or to at least

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, like post

**Ellis Taylor:** How did we get How do we get into those

**Tyram:** like sequester themselves maybe for a

**Ellis Taylor:** other dimensions? Can we just send them to like a party dimension until

**Tyram:** while.

**Ellis Taylor:** we're ready to

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. H. Maybe with a

**Ellis Taylor:** deal?

**Luke Neverisky:** postal.

**Christopher Hooper:** a space telescope or a space transmitter

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Maybe maybe we got to the other dimension by visiting uh Red's

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Tyram:** hometown, but I don't know. Maybe

**Christopher Hooper:** thing. Stellar radio. That's what it is. Sorry. Stellar

**Tyram:** I Okay, but yeah, that might be our best

**Christopher Hooper:** radio.

**Tyram:** bet there is to try to just get um Helisana to go away,

**Ellis Taylor:** yeah.

**Tyram:** right? At least like tell her like temporarily or something until we can get our ship together enough to deal with

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey,

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** I wonder where if that's where your girlfriend comes

**Ellis Taylor:** hey. Just send them to the Lotus. She can have a

**Tyram:** her.

**Christopher Hooper:** in. Ra Raver

**Ellis Taylor:** standing or Helisana can just have like a standing show at the Lo at the casino. Yeah. And

**Christopher Hooper:** Planet. Oh, like at Las Vegas.

**Ellis Taylor:** then the Ravers just stay there. Yes. Okay.

**Tyram:** Ah,

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Solution.

**Tyram:** honestly, any plan that pulls in Naomi has got my seal of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** approvals.

**Luke Neverisky:** Same

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I like it. I like it. Um, cool. We're getting into stuff that could be done in character. So, y'all ready to dive in? Cool. So, um just the aftermath of the battle.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um Helasana's um now

**Luke Neverisky:** Ready?


### [00:30:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** like floating around and ravers are basically like following her um almost like a like an a singular organism uh with Crang kind of mulling around like a sad puppy.

**Justin Hale:** Bru's already got

**Justin Hale:** a a mobile pot cooking full of

**Tyram:** himself.

**Justin Hale:** stew in preparation for the

**Tyram:** We know the

**Justin Hale:** the cup, I fill the rest of it up with the

**Ellis Taylor:** Or

**Luke Neverisky:** This This with

**Justin Hale:** stew.

**Ellis Taylor:** another

**Luke Neverisky:** liquor. Yeah. I think I heard

**Justin Hale:** It's called brown is delicious and

**Walden Briarhelm:** I would like a

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Justin Hale:** nutritious.

**Walden Briarhelm:** cup of the brown if I

**Justin Hale:** Of course you

**Walden Briarhelm:** could. I'm excited to try your

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, did you make this all

**Justin Hale:** can. Rounds for

**Walden Briarhelm:** regional take on brown.

**Ellis Taylor:** What do you mean regional? Brown

**Walden Briarhelm:** I will I will take that mug

**Ellis Taylor:** is more than just this

**Walden Briarhelm:** and in the

**Ellis Taylor:** guy. Oh

**Tyram:** brown is a dive bar staple. You're just too used to your uptown pizzeras. I

**Ellis Taylor:** god. I mean, they're not

**Walden Briarhelm:** guess.

**Ellis Taylor:** wrong. Olivia reaches to the top shelf, grabs them for

**Tyram:** guess

**Justin Hale:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** like honey. No means no.

**Tyram:** No one has you in

**Justin Hale:** brown.

**Tyram:** you.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm really starting to notice the differences uh between Helisana and

**Luke Neverisky:** know, I just I just don't think

**Walden Briarhelm:** Liliana.

**Luke Neverisky:** that you should force alcohol in her. I just don't It doesn't

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** not force alcohol. This sounds very

**Luke Neverisky:** seem very neighborly.

**Justin Hale:** Well, first of all, I'm not forcing alcohol. I am I am offering her better alcohol than she

**Ellis Taylor:** Now you are trying to make me drink

**Justin Hale:** has.

**Ellis Taylor:** brown and I do not want

**Justin Hale:** I'm I'm trying to give you a meal with

**Ellis Taylor:** it. No, that's that's I'm not I do not want a full stomach on this alcohol.

**Walden Briarhelm:** different.

**Justin Hale:** alcohol. What's the best type of

**Luke Neverisky:** your brown I'm sure your brown is delicious. I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Out of curiosity, at this point, Ma finally takes a a sip of his cup of brown, and you

**Justin Hale:** alcohol?

**Walden Briarhelm:** see his eyes kind of light up for a moment in shock of uh just what he's uh taken into his enjoyment. And it is a very very strong beverage.

**Luke Neverisky:** sure

**Walden Briarhelm:** It is something almost dwarven in nature. It's so uh

**Ellis Taylor:** No, not yet. We'll be ready for

**Walden Briarhelm:** potent. And uh he lets out like oh my I see

**Ellis Taylor:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that you have a very different recipe of brown meaning uh is typically used to his like citrusy fruit brown which was just the leftover slaps usually. This is a much stronger

**Luke Neverisky:** I can see

**Walden Briarhelm:** stew and liquor brown. Quite shocking but not bad.

**Luke Neverisky:** ground.

**Justin Hale:** See? You

**Christopher Hooper:** It's at this point you see April Bonal, Casey Bones, Bernardo um crawl out of the sewer pipe you came from. Says, "Hey, Yola." Bernardo says, "Hey, what's up? Y'all couldn't wait

**Justin Hale:** see? Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** right.

**Tyram:** instead. And this is the part of Helisana that they spat

**Christopher Hooper:** check

**Tyram:** back

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, you know, we had a little bit of a

**Ellis Taylor:** We

**Tyram:** out.


### [00:40:00]

**Luke Neverisky:** conversation and uh they don't know what's going on with her now, but um I'm here now and uh yeah, you know, she's she's all doing her doom and gloom and well, that's just not my vibe.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** Okay, so good news and bad

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Tyram:** news. Good news is that it looks like Helisana is still a game for uh kicking out the Iron Claws. Bad news probably not going to get up to good stuff

**Luke Neverisky:** No, she's Yeah, she pulled

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, well, I want to

**Tyram:** afterwards.

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** kill Crang One for what they've done to me.

**Tyram:** That is still totally on the

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, she

**Luke Neverisky:** No, she probably

**Justin Hale:** probably doesn't care about

**Christopher Hooper:** Who?

**Tyram:** agenda. If it makes me feel any better, at least right now, Crang

**Luke Neverisky:** doesn't. Oh, S probably doesn't. She She didn't

**Justin Hale:** him.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Tyram:** is uh being kind of led around like a

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Um, okay.

**Tyram:** b****.

**Luke Neverisky:** care. That's the way to put

**Christopher Hooper:** I guess uh I guess it'll be more vulnerable.

**Tyram:** Oh yeah, he's not empowered by uh e eject

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Tyram:** anymore. So he should be much easier to kill if we find him

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. So, Casey, the poison pizza still works.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, wait. Hold

**Christopher Hooper:** Wait. Uh, it wasn't this pizza, right? No. No, it wasn't. We haven't applied

**Luke Neverisky:** He f****.

**Justin Hale:** on. You trying to poison us? I start pulling out

**Christopher Hooper:** the poison yet. Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I do not want to have poison

**Justin Hale:** daggers.

**Tyram:** again.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. No, no, we haven't put the poison in yet. Um, that was part of the plan. We're still in planning

**Tyram:** Okay, so we need to get our heads together and

**Luke Neverisky:** Well,

**Tyram:** come up with a plan to confront Helisana after the Iron Claws are dealt

**Walden Briarhelm:** pizza.

**Luke Neverisky:** that's right.

**Christopher Hooper:** process. You said wait.

**Ellis Taylor:** Wait, who are you trying to

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, retired detective Olivia

**Ellis Taylor:** poison?

**Tyram:** with.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cooper. Um, most of the ravers, but especially Crang

**Ellis Taylor:** Are you What is your poison do? Yeah. No, we're

**Christopher Hooper:** one, kill

**Ellis Taylor:** not doing

**Tyram:** I don't mind if they poison crank

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, pump. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** them.

**Ellis Taylor:** that. Well, we'll discuss that one maybe, but definitely not the ravers. They're just children in a thrral.

**Christopher Hooper:** They're they're goners. Their mind's

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, no they're

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** gone. I've seen I've been in those vessels. I know what it does to

**Ellis Taylor:** not. No,

**Tyram:** one.

**Christopher Hooper:** you. It f**** with your head. They they'd be They're

**Ellis Taylor:** cuz No, cuz when we were fighting them, once you hit them,

**Christopher Hooper:** probably begging for

**Ellis Taylor:** they're like, "Ah." And just kind of like walked off.

**Christopher Hooper:** death.

**Ellis Taylor:** So,

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, I haven't seen that happen

**Ellis Taylor:** no. Oh, you're just Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** when I try to fight

**Ellis Taylor:** honey.

**Justin Hale:** Are you actually trying to fight them or are you too

**Christopher Hooper:** them. Well, the three of us cornered one of them

**Justin Hale:** weak? That didn't answer my question.

**Christopher Hooper:** and uh, well, it didn't go

**Ellis Taylor:** I give you a second

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm sure you tried your

**Justin Hale:** Are you Are you weak? Are you weak,

**Christopher Hooper:** well.

**Ellis Taylor:** chance.

**Justin Hale:** Arcel?

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean, I'm

**Luke Neverisky:** best. Yes, it's

**Justin Hale:** All right, I look over at the party. She's a

**Christopher Hooper:** fine. What is

**Ellis Taylor:** You think this is

**Justin Hale:** weak

**Christopher Hooper:** it? You're a weak

**Ellis Taylor:** just what?

**Justin Hale:** person. I I know this. I'm not

**Christopher Hooper:** person. Oh,

**Justin Hale:** advertising that. I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. I'm not

**Walden Briarhelm:** Would it make any sense

**Luke Neverisky:** fine.

**Justin Hale:** not. You thought of

**Christopher Hooper:** either.

**Walden Briarhelm:** if we just poisoned Kang one and avoided all the

**Justin Hale:** this?

**Ellis Taylor:** Just stay with me.

**Walden Briarhelm:** other

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I mean, if they can eat a whole pizza by themselves,

**Walden Briarhelm:** casualties? Uh, he is a big baby. I do not

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, that's so much

**Walden Briarhelm:** know if he would be able to do

**Justin Hale:** You could challenge him to

**Ellis Taylor:** It's

**Justin Hale:** eating contest.

**Christopher Hooper:** But then you would have to eat the

**Luke Neverisky:** pizza.

**Justin Hale:** Perhaps you give him poison pizza. You give us non-poison

**Christopher Hooper:** pizza,

**Tyram:** Brew's eating a lot of disgusting s***. He might be able to

**Justin Hale:** pizza. We have whole

**Tyram:** develop an immunity to the

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Justin Hale:** That is true. If your poison is

**Christopher Hooper:** too.

**Tyram:** poison.

**Justin Hale:** as weak as you are, I could probably handle

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay. Yeah, sure. Um, why don't you challenge Crank one to a pizza eating contest and we'll poison both

**Luke Neverisky:** have that

**Justin Hale:** it. I mean, you still don't have to poison

**Christopher Hooper:** pizzas?

**Justin Hale:** both pizzas. You could not poison mine. It sounds like you want to poison me

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, you could do

**Luke Neverisky:** sound. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, what if he switches

**Walden Briarhelm:** that. We have to keep you safe. Brut, do you really think you could do

**Justin Hale:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** pizza? This

**Walden Briarhelm:** this?

**Christopher Hooper:** is only going to work one

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, bro. It's not worth you being poisoned. It just seems that seems more

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Luke Neverisky:** risky, you know.

**Christopher Hooper:** time. Don't sign up for this unless you're willing to go the whole way.

**Justin Hale:** I can go farther than you

**Christopher Hooper:** Peru.

**Justin Hale:** can. Do you want the arm wrestle right

**Christopher Hooper:** No, you can't.

**Walden Briarhelm:** agree.

**Christopher Hooper:** construction workers are like working on a facade or something they'll have like this like scaffolding that like covers the front of a building. It's kind of like that that like sits in front of the building. Um, are y'all uh in dis I assumed y'all

**Ellis Taylor:** Stupid

**Tyram:** Yeah, we have our hats in disguise. So, I just

**Christopher Hooper:** were in your

**Tyram:** I make myself look like not

**Christopher Hooper:** disc? Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** TV.

**Tyram:** Silus. Oh s***.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so are y'all putting on any sort of specific

**Tyram:** Well, no. Liliana would be fine. No one knows what she looks like. So,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I don't need

**Christopher Hooper:** facade?

**Tyram:** okay. Helisana took the hat of disguise, I assume.

**Luke Neverisky:** to

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, Liliana has has all the same

**Ellis Taylor:** I don't

**Luke Neverisky:** That being said,

**Christopher Hooper:** stuff basically.

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah, she I would say she doesn't need a disguise because clearly she sort of

**Ellis Taylor:** think we are not

**Luke Neverisky:** existed an hour ago.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, so what do you think? Like are y'all doing anything specific as as you kind of like walk through here in the

**Ellis Taylor:** Start.

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, I guess I want to try to like scout out what kind of defenses the iron forge the iron claws have. Probably looks like they have the golems, but do I like notice any other like

**Christopher Hooper:** public?

**Tyram:** guards or anything


### [01:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. So there are the so the door to the forchart has two sets of patrols and then the hall itself has

**Tyram:** posted?

**Christopher Hooper:** um like two basically like uh patrols that like mirror each other in a circle like around the hall. Um uh clockwise. Um, anything else? Um, it's kind of hard to like make

**Ellis Taylor:** this video.

**Christopher Hooper:** out who's ironclaw patrol guards and stuff and who's like laborers working on either the uh scaffoldings or the uh stage. Um, so I think it's a little hard to see more than that unless you want to like dig in more more

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, is there anyone post up

**Christopher Hooper:** closely.

**Ellis Taylor:** selling stuff?

**Christopher Hooper:** selling

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** stuff. Um, you see, um, go ahead and give me a perception check.

**Ellis Taylor:** 15. I

**Christopher Hooper:** You see, there are a couple food trucks um that have set up on either side of the hall. Um and uh

**Ellis Taylor:** got a

**Christopher Hooper:** one's about halfway between where you came in and uh where your apartment is. Um that you're starting to pass by as you walk to your

**Ellis Taylor:** friend. Okay. You

**Christopher Hooper:** apartment. Hi

**Christopher Hooper:** lock. Um, and it opens. Um, so, uh, yeah, Olivia

**Ellis Taylor:** locks.

**Christopher Hooper:** O, most people own just like a floor of these apartments, but Olivia owns the the full apartment. Um, and at the bottom, it actually, um, can you explain there's three floors to this. Can you explain like what each floor would

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Wait, I only own three. Wait, I

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes. Well, it's called a point

**Christopher Hooper:** apartment building that's been made in like uh modern

**Ellis Taylor:** it's called a point access block, which means there's a maximum of four units per level. So that way we can have a single centralized spare. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** replies, "Yeah, I guess it comes with practice." And and Litu says, "Yeah, that's what my master always says is nothing prepares you like actual action." That's what he's always telling me. Oh yeah. And uh Chuck Rock says, "Yeah, that's what Olivia always says, too." She says, "Uh, you can try to use all the theory you want, but nothing nothing prepares you for when there's a gun to your head."

**Walden Briarhelm:** Megan's leg injury, showering is a not a real go. So,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. What?

**Walden Briarhelm:** we had to get a different shower head. And man, I remember a time period where the idea of having to change a shower head was like, "Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** you.

**Walden Briarhelm:** man. This could be a thing." And now I'm like, "God, I wish everything was easy. New shower head works great." Now we have one with a hose.

**Luke Neverisky:** Even

**Justin Hale:** That's how I feel about installing ceiling fans. Now it's like I got

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. All right. There's

**Justin Hale:** to install a ceiling fan. Yes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** There's some weird stuff like that. How is

**Justin Hale:** Cakewalk.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the uh new

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I've never done uh I've never done framing before, so

**Walden Briarhelm:** house? How

**Justin Hale:** that was a fun pick off the list.

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh how is the house? I know I had a lot of projects that you had on your mind. That's good. That's excellent. Is that

**Justin Hale:** It's It's still

**Walden Briarhelm:** a Wi-Fi I see behind

**Justin Hale:** upright despite its best efforts of uh falling into the

**Walden Briarhelm:** you? Oh, looks

**Justin Hale:** ground. Did you say something about

**Walden Briarhelm:** like I saw like what I thought looked like a ceiling Wi-Fi

**Justin Hale:** Wi-Fi?

**Walden Briarhelm:** router. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, that

**Walden Briarhelm:** Nice.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. When we uh when we moved into this house, I uh spent lots of money on networking equipment,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I wish I had. Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** like over $1,000, maybe. I bought a enterprise router and

**Walden Briarhelm:** easily. Well,

**Justin Hale:** enterprise access points.

**Walden Briarhelm:** yeah. Yeah. Pimp it out so that you have like two gig download everywhere. Well,

**Justin Hale:** about

**Walden Briarhelm:** I don't know what your ISP

**Justin Hale:** the um yeah

**Walden Briarhelm:** is.

**Justin Hale:** my ISP caps at one gigabit per

**Walden Briarhelm:** But still looks

**Justin Hale:** second. My internal speeds do

**Christopher Hooper:** How's that upload speed?

**Justin Hale:** what? Uh it was

**Christopher Hooper:** How's that upload speed

**Walden Briarhelm:** great.

**Justin Hale:** garbage. I think it's a little bit better

**Christopher Hooper:** now? That's what I care about.

**Justin Hale:** now. Let's see. My Wi-Fi My Wi-Fi download is 600 meg down. Yeah, my upload's garbo. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** Dang

**Justin Hale:** 35 about to drop like 800 bucks on a on a network area

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Truly.

**Justin Hale:** storage. Yep. The UNAS

**Walden Briarhelm:** And what we need to do with

**Christopher Hooper:** N you n man. This is really bad timing for you. There's like a bunch of really expensive nice

**Justin Hale:** Pro. Yeah. Yeah, that's what

**Christopher Hooper:** like UniFi stuff

**Walden Briarhelm:** this, what would you

**Justin Hale:** it all


### [01:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Walden Briarhelm:** do with a a

**Justin Hale:** is. Beef up the current one that I already have. So, I have a Plex

**Walden Briarhelm:** NAS? Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** server that I run a bunch of media off of. Uh, it's all automated, too. So, I just like make a request for whatever I want and then it's on Plex, you know, minutes to days later. Um, current one I have though is just like a direct access storage connected to a little um M1 Mac

**Walden Briarhelm:** What? Oh

**Justin Hale:** Mini and the bottleneck is the Mac Mini itself. Uh, because the

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***.

**Justin Hale:** uh the um Ethernet port on the Mac Mini is like 100 megabits per second. So the pro I think caps out at like two and a half gigabit per second internally. So um it will be direct storage attach attached directly to the network. So uh there's no bottleneck of any processing that will free up the Mac Mini to do all of the processing for like transcoding, downloading, uh all those things that it needs to do as a server. And then all the data can be served directly from the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Cool. Is that the FIFA cup behind you or just a

**Justin Hale:** UNESC.

**Walden Briarhelm:** big glowing green

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that is my wife playing Story of Cecilus. I turn this off. That's not

**Walden Briarhelm:** screen? The big

**Justin Hale:** it. There it

**Tyram:** Did you ask

**Walden Briarhelm:** green area made me think it was a soccer field.

**Justin Hale:** is.

**Tyram:** where Nashville won the Open

**Justin Hale:** I did

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I did. I was um I had to watch the second half from the sidelines of my own soccer

**Tyram:** Cup?

**Christopher Hooper:** game as between between subs. I was like yelling at my phone as everyone's like, "What

**Tyram:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** are you doing? We just won a

**Tyram:** we just got our first

**Justin Hale:** not.

**Christopher Hooper:** champion." The first professional uh

**Tyram:** trophy. Oh, is that

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** team's trophy in Tennessee. It's

**Tyram:** right? Well, yeah. I guess the haven't gotten

**Walden Briarhelm:** Where are

**Christopher Hooper:** wild. Yeah.

**Tyram:** the cup and Titans haven't gotten a Super Bowl. So, yeah, I guess that

**Justin Hale:** awesome,

**Tyram:** works.

**Justin Hale:** dude. Nashville's MLS team is

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Tyram:** Yeah, I mean the prince for playing for the Stanley Cup, God, I guess it was a little while

**Walden Briarhelm:** we?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. This season very

**Tyram:** ago now, but um we have our we have

**Justin Hale:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Tyram:** our we have our good years, but yeah, SC has been consistently the best for the last few years from

**Justin Hale:** I'll never not root for

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. The

**Tyram:** Nashville.

**Christopher Hooper:** cool part is this puts us into the Champions League. Uh, which means we get to play like the best teams in the continent and like

**Tyram:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** potentially other really good

**Justin Hale:** Tennessee. Nice. Uh, Toeer, do you go to any games? Are you

**Christopher Hooper:** teams. Yeah, I'm a season ticket

**Justin Hale:** seriously? Um, I need you to find a

**Christopher Hooper:** holder.

**Justin Hale:** uh scarf for

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. I have two. You want

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Justin Hale:** me. Uh, I'm looking specifically for Whoa, that didn't work. I'm looking specifically for the hot chicken

**Christopher Hooper:** one?

**Justin Hale:** one. if you if you see that one because it kind of goes with

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** my camera

**Christopher Hooper:** sure. Oh, yeah. Clicking.

**Justin Hale:** tag. This is what it looks like

**Christopher Hooper:** Awesome. Got it. Yeah, that makes sense.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so I don't have a lot planned for the um the rest of the session because I wanted to leave it open um

**Tyram:** All

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** for if y'all had schemes you wanted to do in preparation for uh next session we will go balls to the wall uh probably continuous action for the uh Helga confrontation.

**Ellis Taylor:** My only plan was to try and find better armor,

**Tyram:** right. Well,

**Ellis Taylor:** but I'm doing bedtime and bath time, so I'll figure that out.

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Tyram:** um

**Walden Briarhelm:** Liliana, I I would like

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to ask a few questions since you are so new but not a stranger to the group. How well do you know each of

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** um

**Walden Briarhelm:** us?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I saw what Helana saw. So, you know, I I know I know a

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. So, it's like uh just you cast a baton and now you are her and she is

**Luke Neverisky:** bit. Yeah, that's the way to look at it. I know

**Walden Briarhelm:** you. Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** it's all really confusing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh Silus, I believe you are going to say

**Tyram:** No, no, never mind.

**Walden Briarhelm:** something. We we have finished our long rest at this

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** point. Are are we in day two

**Christopher Hooper:** So, you wake up.

**Luke Neverisky:** Hey

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you're on day two. You have one more

**Walden Briarhelm:** then? Oh, the moon is

**Luke Neverisky:** shoot.

**Christopher Hooper:** day. One more day

**Walden Briarhelm:** close.

**Christopher Hooper:** before revolution.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** One more. One more day. One day

**Tyram:** Although I guess I will try to talk to uh I guess I probably should

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Tyram:** talk talk to Lily here. Um though it looks like you do have some uh some powers and everything after

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Luke Neverisky:** Beautiful. Yeah. The power of

**Christopher Hooper:** more.

**Luke Neverisky:** music, you know.

**Tyram:** all. What can you tell us about what we'd be getting into if we went after Helisana now?

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, I mean, you saw she's uh I mean, she's a little rough around the edges. She means well, obviously. Um, at least that's what I

**Tyram:** It's

**Luke Neverisky:** think. Um, because I know I mean well, and you know, um, you'd be getting into, listen, she's been trying to get famous and recognized ever

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait a

**Luke Neverisky:** since this whole deal with her patron. Now that she's

**Tyram:** just

**Luke Neverisky:** finally getting it, I don't think she's going to want to give it up

**Tyram:** Well, are you

**Walden Briarhelm:** minute.

**Tyram:** would you be um okay if it if it comes down to it? Would you have it in you to help us kill your other

**Luke Neverisky:** willingly. Oh, I mean it would it would really break my heart for

**Tyram:** half?

**Luke Neverisky:** sure. Uh, but I obviously care about um I care about the people in front of me that aren't trying to murder each other friends wise. So

**Tyram:** It's kind of sad, but that's literally nicer than

**Luke Neverisky:** um really rather not

**Tyram:** anything Hillisana has ever said to

**Luke Neverisky:** but she like I said she means well. She I there was a sliver of of care there. She just rough around the edges, you

**Tyram:** us.

**Luke Neverisky:** know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So what do we do Ifana does not show up with the

**Luke Neverisky:** I think she'll show up. I mean, this She's playing a show, right? She loves

**Justin Hale:** She's still egotistical not to

**Walden Briarhelm:** rivers.

**Justin Hale:** show I say out of the cupboard with the cupboard still

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay. I guess I am overthinking it. You are right. You know her best.

**Luke Neverisky:** I'll uh

**Justin Hale:** closed. I don't I don't think anyone

**Tyram:** Well,

**Justin Hale:** knows her best.

**Tyram:** honestly, that's I'm feeling pretty melancholic about that if I got to be perfectly honest here. I feel like Helisana is gone, but part of me feels like, did we ever even really know her at all? She didn't let us into any of these weird squid struggles that she was dealing

**Luke Neverisky:** H. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** All of my friends keep

**Tyram:** with.

**Luke Neverisky:** I'll be your

**Justin Hale:** leaving for

**Luke Neverisky:** friend.

**Justin Hale:** now until you leave,

**Tyram:** So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** f***.

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, don't say that, Brew. I'm definitely going to stay

**Tyram:** I will actually like open the closet door for Brew and be like, "Well, we've been stuck with each other for long enough now,

**Justin Hale:** too. Uh, Brew looks like an absolute

**Tyram:** Brew, I don't doubt

**Luke Neverisky:** here.

**Justin Hale:** wreck. You open the cupboard

**Tyram:** it.

**Justin Hale:** door and there's like there's like black bars underneath his eyes. He's kind of shaking a little bit like like hung over shaking

**Tyram:** I

**Justin Hale:** kind of thing. open the door. He's

**Tyram:** walk off and I get like a cup of water and I come over and bring it to

**Justin Hale:** like, he just downs it.

**Luke Neverisky:** I'll uh I'll see if Brew will accept some

**Tyram:** him.

**Luke Neverisky:** scritches.

**Justin Hale:** Just bro totally goes into dog. It's like little little leg

**Tyram:** Bro, we talked about that. That's weird. Don't do

**Justin Hale:** movement. That's voluntary. I get

**Tyram:** it. Damn it,

**Justin Hale:** that

**Tyram:** bro.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. See, he's just a cute little goblin.

**Tyram:** Well, I don't honestly don't know if we meant anything to Helisana, but Helisana

**Justin Hale:** with


### [02:00:00]

**Tyram:** meant something to us, I think. We'll try to do what we can to

**Luke Neverisky:** That sounds

**Tyram:** her. But I guess that's to some other day's

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** problem. But how can

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. One thing at a

**Tyram:** we at least get Helisana to not, you know, burn the city to the

**Luke Neverisky:** time. Well, I mean, I always think that music is pretty powerful. So, like, um, I don't know. Maybe playing something to the antithesis of her sad mel melancholy metal or there's got to be some way to even

**Tyram:** ground? You volunteering there,

**Luke Neverisky:** her out or smooth her over a little bit, you

**Tyram:** Lily?

**Walden Briarhelm:** It sure sounds like

**Luke Neverisky:** know? Oh jeez. I

**Justin Hale:** What

**Luke Neverisky:** maybe I don't know. Gosh.

**Justin Hale:** is it?

**Tyram:** Well, hey, I guess we'll try to help

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. We've just met you and you already are going to be

**Luke Neverisky:** Maybe. Oh jeez. All

**Tyram:** you. One huge edge we definitely have is that there's no

**Walden Briarhelm:** part of a rockoff.

**Tyram:** way that any of those assholes and her uh stage crew will be able

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** to match the pirate technics display that Ellmith and Brew could kick up.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, pyrochnics. That seems

**Tyram:** God damn it, Lily. This is the one edge we

**Justin Hale:** If

**Luke Neverisky:** dangerous. Sure. Well, if you're

**Justin Hale:** that's the whole

**Tyram:** have. I'm just picturing like um I'm just picturing like

**Luke Neverisky:** sure

**Justin Hale:** point, life is short. Live it

**Tyram:** a jewel concert with like really intense

**Justin Hale:** dangerously. Just explosions of

**Tyram:** pyrochnics. Oh s***, bro. Could we do that? Could we just do like instead of fire we do like sunshine and flowers and s***?

**Justin Hale:** flowers. You insult

**Tyram:** All right. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** me. Of course. Of course it's possible.

**Tyram:** See, already our legendary collaboration for stage shows is already paying

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, that seems

**Tyram:** dividends. You are killing me, Lily. But okay, sure.

**Justin Hale:** Do you think we could kill Helisa with

**Walden Briarhelm:** I have a feeling that Liliana

**Luke Neverisky:** safer.

**Justin Hale:** kindness?

**Walden Briarhelm:** can

**Luke Neverisky:** kill kindness. I don't know. That doesn't

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Tyram:** I don't know how much you noticed about how we tend to resolve our problems, but there is typically a lot of killing involved. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** seem hair. That's fair. I have noticed

**Tyram:** I mean, not always, but frequently. You

**Luke Neverisky:** that sometimes. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** Sometimes sometimes they deserve it. I

**Tyram:** know, how about we try to subdue Helisana with

**Luke Neverisky:** understand. There we

**Tyram:** kindness? All

**Luke Neverisky:** go. I mean, each seems to be pretty musically oriented, so musically susceptible.

**Tyram:** right. Okay. So, we just need to find out how you

**Ellis Taylor:** big.

**Tyram:** can match her Squid Satan enhanced

**Luke Neverisky:** Maybe that's right.

**Justin Hale:** We need to gear

**Tyram:** powers. Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** up a little

**Tyram:** but I guess first we got to deal with uh Helga and all that and uh hopefully get the dragons to go away and then find some way to at least sequester Helisana for

**Justin Hale:** bit.

**Tyram:** now.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, cuz she's got the whole patron of thing. I'm just an a normal person that you know of. I put

**Justin Hale:** that we know

**Tyram:** I don't know how cryptic that was,

**Luke Neverisky:** normal in air quotes because you

**Justin Hale:** of. You could be praying to

**Tyram:** but

**Luke Neverisky:** know sunshine

**Justin Hale:** some sunshine god or something.

**Tyram:** okay. All right. Oh, incredibly f******

**Justin Hale:** Is there any

**Tyram:** stupid. Maybe we can convince her that um she has to go to like a sbatical or something before she can re like the Beatles did, whoever they are. And then we Yeah, the Beatles

**Luke Neverisky:** god. Well, there they

**Tyram:** are I Okay, so maybe in this setting the Beatles were just like

**Justin Hale:** um Oh, you mean the

**Tyram:** anthropomorphic

**Justin Hale:** arachnids? Yeah. Well, all right. Fair

**Tyram:** Beatles like the Beatles did. They went off on like a sbatical and they came back and like set the world on fire all over again. Maybe we convince Alisan she needs to do that for a few weeks or months or

**Ellis Taylor:** You know what? If your girlfriend offered her a residency

**Tyram:** years,

**Luke Neverisky:** are. That's

**Ellis Taylor:** at the casino, I mean, they had an amazing

**Tyram:** whatever. She

**Luke Neverisky:** true.

**Justin Hale:** enough.

**Ellis Taylor:** stage.

**Tyram:** does basically run that

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. And giving her a monopoly would, you know, probably be

**Tyram:** place. And who gives a s*** if she burns down Marvin's place? As long as Naomi can like, you know, get out of there alive. I don't care about the rest of

**Justin Hale:** There's a

**Tyram:** that. Although, I did

**Luke Neverisky:** pretty. That is the

**Justin Hale:** roof. Olivia, I need to

**Luke Neverisky:** ref.

**Justin Hale:** well?

**Tyram:** shopping.

**Justin Hale:** I need to buy lots of

**Christopher Hooper:** All right,

**Christopher Hooper:** shopping. Cool. Uh, Liliana, uh, what do you want to do while they go

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, it's a good question. I want to go

**Justin Hale:** supplies. Do you want to come

**Luke Neverisky:** shopping.

**Justin Hale:** with

**Walden Briarhelm:** Um, out of character, how much money has

**Luke Neverisky:** Absolutely.

**Tyram:** I don't remember getting a

**Walden Briarhelm:** Silus as a an

**Tyram:** scent from

**Walden Briarhelm:** agreement. I'm asking I'm doing my accounting live.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so you had about 500 gold um to start with. Whoa.

**Tyram:** like move things to the party inventory from our personal

**Luke Neverisky:** Wat.

**Christopher Hooper:** like

**Tyram:** inventory? Okay.

**Justin Hale:** cool. Yeah. Does doesn't Silus have like all of the

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh-huh.

**Tyram:** Okay. I don't I don't remember anyone else giving me money. I have what Silus personally

**Justin Hale:** money? I don't think I have added any

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** has,

**Justin Hale:** money to my own sheet, which is a which is a

**Tyram:** but I I wasn't keeping track of anybody for you. I'll tell that for damn

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, that has Elizabeth has been spending she spent all of her

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, cup hurts.

**Christopher Hooper:** money. Um I think Elizabeth has a lot of

**Justin Hale:** bad

**Christopher Hooper:** money. Um I

**Tyram:** sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** don't know about Hely. Hely had a lot of money too. She didn't like spend any of it

**Tyram:** Did Did

**Luke Neverisky:** She had 1,800 on the character sheet. So if it's if I can inherit

**Tyram:** Liliana get the body that had all the money? Okay,

**Luke Neverisky:** that. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** either.

**Justin Hale:** How much money should we

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Good.

**Justin Hale:** have roughly? Because I don't I don't

**Tyram:** good. I've got

**Tyram:** and I haven't really spent a scent of that yet.

**Justin Hale:** Did

**Christopher Hooper:** money, Brew, on on like the resources for the um pocket

**Justin Hale:** I? Yeah, it's

**Tyram:** arranged to trade uh those head shot of Joel for the resources

**Christopher Hooper:** village?

**Tyram:** for the pocket

**Justin Hale:** probably

**Christopher Hooper:** I think you chipped away a lot of

**Tyram:** village?

**Christopher Hooper:** that. Um,

**Justin Hale:** Well, that

**Christopher Hooper:** so you might just not have any money, bro. I don't

**Tyram:** I know you would have spent some of your money on like pyrochnics back for Helisana's first

**Justin Hale:** sucks. Yeah. What a waste that

**Christopher Hooper:** know. Also, so I'm a little confused about the love bombs.

**Justin Hale:** was.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, they're potions you had, right? So, you probably bought those potions or had them

**Tyram:** concert.

**Justin Hale:** Mhm. Yeah. Well, that's that's

**Christopher Hooper:** at some point. Okay. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** what I need to do now is reup. But uh potions are expensive and I don't have any money.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, yeah. So, you probably already

**Walden Briarhelm:** How many

**Justin Hale:** So

**Christopher Hooper:** bought stuff and that's why you have no

**Walden Briarhelm:** potions do you need,

**Justin Hale:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** money.

**Justin Hale:** Well, I was going to do a couple of things for Kevin to make him uh more of bad. I was going to get him some some alchemist fires, some

**Walden Briarhelm:** Brew?

**Justin Hale:** acids, some more potions. was gonna try and fash in some

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh. Oh

**Justin Hale:** webslingers for

**Walden Briarhelm:** my. You're turning him into quite the slayer. How much money do you think that would

**Justin Hale:** him. I have no idea.

**Walden Briarhelm:** take? How much are we thinking

**Justin Hale:** Probably lots. Uh I still have quite a few alchemist

**Tyram:** I don't like heaven, but it does sound pretty rad, I will

**Walden Briarhelm:** there?

**Justin Hale:** fires

**Tyram:** admit.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Him decked out with different grenades and

**Justin Hale:** actually.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hi, I'm

**Tyram:** Shut up,

**Walden Briarhelm:** stuff. Prepare to

**Justin Hale:** Hey, hey,

**Walden Briarhelm:** die. How much do we think it would cost

**Justin Hale:** you love Kevin. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** toer for us to deck out Kevin in a like

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a a full Rambo style of DND

**Justin Hale:** actually, I still have four Alchemist fires on

**Tyram:** Kevin.

**Justin Hale:** me that I'm going to put on

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay.

**Justin Hale:** Kevin.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool. Um, and you


### [02:10:00]

**Tyram:** You know, I wonder if the iron claws or the resistance, since we're honestly not super cool with the resistance anymore, have like

**Walden Briarhelm:** weaponry?

**Tyram:** a potion uh stockpile we could

**Justin Hale:** So, so

**Christopher Hooper:** can

**Tyram:** raid.

**Justin Hale:** shopping

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you could uh try to find places to buy or try to find places to steal. Um, you don't have a lot of time. Just keep keeping that in mind

**Justin Hale:** Uh, Brew Brew

**Christopher Hooper:** for like a stockpile heist.

**Justin Hale:** will probably spend the day trying to

**Christopher Hooper:** But okay. So any other shenanigans that you were trying to do during that time, you

**Justin Hale:** steal. I mean, the only thing that I have to do

**Christopher Hooper:** probably won't do

**Justin Hale:** is repurpose some of those things and then uh I

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** need to workshop that with you. Basically, I want to be able to make like sticky traps that Kevin can shoot out Spider-Man style. So, basically

**Christopher Hooper:** then.

**Justin Hale:** like little wrist things that he flips with, but they just shoot out like

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** a I don't know, like rough terrain or something, but it's like, you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Adhesive.

**Justin Hale:** know, sticky web. Uh, and like one per

**Christopher Hooper:** Wasn't there something you wanted to do with that you were DMing me about earlier this

**Justin Hale:** use. What?

**Tyram:** That

**Justin Hale:** Were

**Tyram:** sounds like it would be recreating the DND spell

**Christopher Hooper:** week?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** they? Oh, is that

**Tyram:** web.

**Luke Neverisky:** basically.

**Justin Hale:** a thing?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, Liliana, you want to go shopping? Anything you're

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** looking out looking looking out for

**Luke Neverisky:** know. Um, I take a look at what kind of gear I should be

**Christopher Hooper:** specifically?

**Tyram:** Yes.

**Luke Neverisky:** looking at for a for a bard. Um, I saw your price checker, so I'm going to take a look there. Um, yeah. So, come back to me on that. I will I'll take a look. I'm assuming anything like can is there anything off limits with regret? Like there's no armor shopping available, there's no weapons or things like that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you can find um uncommon

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** and uh

**Tyram:** Actually, I want to check

**Christopher Hooper:** below. Um uh now that

**Tyram:** something.

**Luke Neverisky:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** you know how much gold you have, uh did you come up with

**Walden Briarhelm:** I am a I am

**Christopher Hooper:** something?

**Walden Briarhelm:** a torto who lives off of the land mostly. I would much rather use my gold to help pay for the others things I need. I also would love to see Kevin with a multitude

**Tyram:** It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** of ammunitions.

**Justin Hale:** I mean,

**Tyram:** okay.

**Justin Hale:** if you want to stock up on things of liquid in in vials, that's fine with

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, I I will probably purchase a few health

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** potions then as

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, cool. Um, so you got the price checker. You can see how much those

**Walden Briarhelm:** well.

**Christopher Hooper:** cost and look up um those resources if you

**Justin Hale:** I will

**Christopher Hooper:** want.

**Justin Hale:** give uh a list of components that I'm looking for.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um All right. Um, so you um you search around the city, you know pretty well. Um, you end up finding a potions um

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** purveyor uh back down in the underl. Um, it uh you uh happened to see it when you're down there uh

**Justin Hale:** Can you give me a

**Christopher Hooper:** briefly. Um,

**Tyram:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** and no

**Justin Hale:** hug?

**Christopher Hooper:** hugs. Yes, hugs, of course. Um, we'll say, uh, Elmo, you're steering as you as you both go.

**Tyram:** harsh.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and so you find a potion shop. There's someone standing outside and says, "Uh, hello. Are you here to buy potions?" And it's a very old

**Walden Briarhelm:** very

**Christopher Hooper:** dwarf.

**Walden Briarhelm:** old dwarf. Oh, hello. My name is Omar. What is your name?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. My name is

**Walden Briarhelm:** Did you say your name is

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mr. Tunak. I have a list of different items that I would like to purchase. Some vials of acid,

**Christopher Hooper:** said.

**Walden Briarhelm:** some uh some health potions, and some other

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Walden Briarhelm:** items.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Excellent.

**Christopher Hooper:** place. Do you got

**Walden Briarhelm:** pony show. I am trying to get exactly what I came here

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** for.

**Christopher Hooper:** Your your eyes aren't glowing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** You're not a raver. You got tattoos, but not the ones I normally

**Walden Briarhelm:** no. Oh. Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** see. You an

**Walden Briarhelm:** no. Do not be

**Christopher Hooper:** angler,

**Walden Briarhelm:** mistaken.

**Christopher Hooper:** huh? Well, who are you? Good night, Olly.

**Tyram:** All

**Walden Briarhelm:** I am simply someone trying

**Tyram:** right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to purchase. Would you like to take my gold or would you like to continue to ask

**Christopher Hooper:** Hulk. I would I'll do both. I want to know where my gold is coming

**Walden Briarhelm:** questions?

**Christopher Hooper:** from. Are you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, let me in your I would let you in on

**Christopher Hooper:** uh you're a toral?

**Walden Briarhelm:** a little secret. Have you heard of the underground wrestler, the ninja

**Luke Neverisky:** Well,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** turtle? He's going to

**Christopher Hooper:** What? Yes. That's the only tortal I've ever seen.

**Walden Briarhelm:** lean forward and go to give a wink, but remember that Silus kind of told him the wink didn't work and it was creepy. And uh instead I give him a little nudge and a grin and say I am the ninja turtle. Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** No way.

**Walden Briarhelm:** And these are ingredients for part of my

**Christopher Hooper:** You You don't look

**Walden Briarhelm:** show. My disguise has

**Christopher Hooper:** anything like

**Walden Briarhelm:** been designed to be very very good.

**Christopher Hooper:** him. Yeah, you I mean there's no there's nothing on your

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. Nobody can see past such a simple eye mask. It

**Christopher Hooper:** face.

**Walden Briarhelm:** is crazy. Those tortos are very defined by just our

**Christopher Hooper:** Wow. I couldn't look away. Well, in that case, I'll give you the same price as I would before, but I won't ratch out to

**Walden Briarhelm:** eylight. Oh, I appreciate the

**Christopher Hooper:** anybody.

**Walden Briarhelm:** tuid. Thanks for doing that for me. So, uh, I I I actually don't have a

**Christopher Hooper:** No

**Walden Briarhelm:** list of exactly what we need, and this magic shop website is a bit confusing,

**Christopher Hooper:** problem. Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** but if I type in acid, I do not see vials of

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't think they have potions on

**Christopher Hooper:** s***.

**Tyram:** Um, acid isn't considered a

**Luke Neverisky:** there or some potions they don't.

**Tyram:** potion. It's a its own

**Walden Briarhelm:** acid.

**Christopher Hooper:** If you put in healing, you'll see all the the different healing.

**Tyram:** thing.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, what? There's a scroll of acid splatch, which I think is like equivalent to what you're talking about,

**Walden Briarhelm:** H Justin

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Brew, could you chime in on what it was you were hoping to receive from our alchemist friend?

**Justin Hale:** Uh looking for flasks of oil, flammable oil

**Christopher Hooper:** oil hat. Uh like grease, like a scroll of

**Justin Hale:** preferably.

**Christopher Hooper:** grease which costs 120 gold.

**Justin Hale:** Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** or a scroll of acid splash, which costs 20

**Justin Hale:** Um, flasks of oil were intended to be thrown to create fires and chaos. We'll

**Christopher Hooper:** gold.

**Tyram:** So they they actually do have like a mundane

**Justin Hale:** see.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** oil in like the like just like the gear part of the player's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. You can look that up if you

**Tyram:** handbook.


### [02:20:04]

**Walden Briarhelm:** How do I get rid of

**Christopher Hooper:** want.

**Justin Hale:** One silver.

**Walden Briarhelm:** stuff?

**Justin Hale:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** What?

**Justin Hale:** yeah. Get wrecked,

**Christopher Hooper:** What? No way. Oil for that

**Justin Hale:** nerd.

**Christopher Hooper:** price? Wow. Imagine they're just giving out oil. Um, all right. So, how much oil do you want to buy?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, how much do they cost? Or are we going with scroll of

**Justin Hale:** Um uh well flies of oil.

**Christopher Hooper:** They cost one silver per

**Walden Briarhelm:** grease? One silver per pound of oil

**Justin Hale:** Well, never

**Walden Briarhelm:** flask.

**Justin Hale:** mind.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wow. Is anybody with me while I'm making this

**Justin Hale:** Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** pound.

**Tyram:** Come

**Walden Briarhelm:** purchase? Oh, it's just the two of us.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think Brew is

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. So, Brew, if uh you use your incredible

**Christopher Hooper:** there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** intellect, I know you can do the math. For just a single gold, it seems like you could buy a lot of oil. How many of these did you want to

**Justin Hale:** over

**Tyram:** on.

**Walden Briarhelm:** buy?

**Justin Hale:** Uh there would be like 10 of

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, how you want only 10 or you're saying it would be

**Justin Hale:** them. Uh one gold would be 10 flasks

**Walden Briarhelm:** 10? Okay. How many do you

**Justin Hale:** of oil. And that would be more can't hold that many. We can buy 10. That's

**Walden Briarhelm:** want?

**Justin Hale:** perfect. That'll that'll hold us for a

**Tyram:** So just maybe you just we can have this could be like a psychic

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** while.

**Tyram:** conversation you're having with uh with because I think the psychic phone lasts for like has like a range of like miles. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. So then let's do uh one gold or 10 uh flasks of oil. And uh

**Justin Hale:** perfect.

**Walden Briarhelm:** let's do five scroll of a splash for another hunter gold. And then we will

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay,

**Walden Briarhelm:** do four potion.

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Justin Hale:** um cover. Is it easier to you to do the what is it web the like a scroll for web or would it be easier to like fashion uh the like material components to do the same thing for

**Walden Briarhelm:** Scroll of

**Justin Hale:** like maybe the same price or

**Walden Briarhelm:** web is an uncommon item that costs 240.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, what do you think web is made

**Justin Hale:** something sticky silk Glue and

**Christopher Hooper:** of? Sticky. Um, I mean, you could you could make a mess

**Justin Hale:** silk. That's the

**Christopher Hooper:** for like I was like, if you're just trying to make

**Justin Hale:** plan.

**Christopher Hooper:** a mess, that's like cheap. A

**Luke Neverisky:** Stickies.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Well, controlled me is

**Christopher Hooper:** controlled mess is a little harder.

**Tyram:** Hey Deborah, what was the markup on the magic

**Justin Hale:** preferable.

**Tyram:** item uh

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Tyram:** thing?

**Christopher Hooper:** um uh they because Ma revealed his identity. It's none at this potion

**Tyram:** I was seeing

**Christopher Hooper:** shop. Um but it depends on what you're going

**Tyram:** if uh could buy me a uh a cloak of

**Christopher Hooper:** for. Oh. Um, you'll have to get that

**Tyram:** protection. Okay. But you said uncommon. So that's what the thing that's the best thing I could find that was

**Christopher Hooper:** elsewhere. Nice. The scroll of web is

**Tyram:** uncommon.

**Christopher Hooper:** 240 gold. So, um, it probably make more sense to just like fashion the scroll of web. Um, if you want to do the equivalent

**Justin Hale:** So, how does that work? Do I get a scroll and then like learn it and then like fashion it into these little web shooters?

**Christopher Hooper:** effect,

**Tyram:** Wow. There might be like a wand of web might be more like

**Justin Hale:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** no,

**Tyram:** what you need here.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Scroll of web is a consumable.

**Christopher Hooper:** no. Yeah. So, one time one time thing.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. That's got to be

**Christopher Hooper:** There is a wand of web. It

**Tyram:** anymore has been scroll for sure,

**Christopher Hooper:** is it is uncommon.

**Tyram:** but it's multiple use and it

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's only 8,000.

**Tyram:** refills. O All right. And

**Walden Briarhelm:** Not a big

**Justin Hale:** expensive.

**Tyram:** I I just looked up I did the price check on the clo protection. It's probably outside

**Christopher Hooper:** So

**Tyram:** of the price range,

**Walden Briarhelm:** deal. Is there any chance like K2

**Christopher Hooper:** All right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** might just have uh an extra uh an

**Justin Hale:** Just the Wanda web kicking

**Walden Briarhelm:** extra scroll of web? Maybe not a wand. It's a little

**Justin Hale:** around.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh um he I'll tell you

**Tyram:** too.

**Christopher Hooper:** what, he has um about a pound of

**Walden Briarhelm:** broken.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, bro. I know that you have the mind for this kind of thing. Grape shot. You know a

**Justin Hale:** You made me cough soda into my

**Christopher Hooper:** grapes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** shot. Oh, but was it the refreshing cold flavor of

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that'd be

**Justin Hale:** nose.

**Christopher Hooper:** awful up in your

**Walden Briarhelm:** Coca-Cola?

**Justin Hale:** H. No, it was Sprite and

**Christopher Hooper:** nose.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Walden Briarhelm:** okay. I believe that I have uh I've locked

**Luke Neverisky:** see.

**Walden Briarhelm:** in knowing that that he do has a a

**Tyram:** Yes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** large quantity of grapes brew be able to do anything with that. I

**Justin Hale:** rum.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I think a single scroll of web for 240

**Christopher Hooper:** Spicy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** and then five scroll of acid splash for 100 for 340 total and then two potion of healing for 50 gold each. four. And then finally, one gold's worth of the oil

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. All right. Uh, cool. That's great. at and uh they go around the the back shop and um get all your stuff into a nice little

**Walden Briarhelm:** flask.

**Christopher Hooper:** cart um and get you a little uh they hand it off to you. All right. Well, I don't know what you're doing with it, but don't tell me and I don't have to get in

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, I put

**Christopher Hooper:** trouble. Oh,

**Justin Hale:** cart. I'm taking the

**Justin Hale:** Bombs.

**Walden Briarhelm:** use the grapes?

**Justin Hale:** That's actually an

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I knew you had it in

**Justin Hale:** interesting idea. Maybe we pull the insides of the grapes

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Justin Hale:** out and we'll use the skin of the grapes as actual

**Walden Briarhelm:** you. Only you would think of

**Justin Hale:** bombs. That's pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** this. So, we will

**Christopher Hooper:** you feel incredible. Why would you

**Luke Neverisky:** okay? Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** need armor?

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, well, have I mean I don't know. Earlier I saw some kids sword fighting around here and you know it's uh it's it's pretty rough out

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that is true. They are fearsome sword fighters. You could be stabbed at any

**Luke Neverisky:** here. See, that's why I need

**Christopher Hooper:** moment. Oh, fair play, madame.

**Luke Neverisky:** armor.

**Christopher Hooper:** If you want to be safe in a dangerous city like this, I have just the armor for

**Luke Neverisky:** Exactly.

**Christopher Hooper:** you, but it will cost you a pretty

**Luke Neverisky:** No. Oh, okay. I mean, I always thought pennies were pretty. They are

**Christopher Hooper:** penny. Yes. What

**Luke Neverisky:** shiny.

**Christopher Hooper:** kind of armor would you like? There is the shiny kind and there is the soft kind.

**Luke Neverisky:** I think that's off. That's just being a little more comfy, you

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, and would you like it bedazzled? Would you like it um sewn with pretty

**Luke Neverisky:** know. Oh, what kind of a jazz? That just sounds

**Christopher Hooper:** pictures? Dazzled soft armor.

**Luke Neverisky:** amazing.

**Christopher Hooper:** Excellent. What a good choice. It looked so pretty. That will be 15,000 Pumpacus

**Luke Neverisky:** I assume you mean goal cuz I don't have You know what? Yeah, sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** skins. Yes. Oh, thank

**Luke Neverisky:** Pumpable to give. Yep. Here you

**Christopher Hooper:** you. And here you areazzled as

**Luke Neverisky:** go.

**Christopher Hooper:** I promised. And they hand you some studded leather armor.

**Luke Neverisky:** So question uh as far as this goes. So like I was saying the studded leather armor is common. There's no like uncommon s. There's the mariners studded

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I think the uncommon

**Luke Neverisky:** leather I guess. Um

**Christopher Hooper:** is just like plus

**Luke Neverisky:** but that's rare category

**Tyram:** Yeah, I was looking at that earlier. Plus one armor is

**Christopher Hooper:** one. Oh, is

**Luke Neverisky:** as blue text.

**Christopher Hooper:** it?

**Luke Neverisky:** There's no. So, it's either common, which is white, or you can jump it to blue, or I think the mariners doesn't offer any AC buff. It's just the whole water breathing

**Christopher Hooper:** But it looks

**Luke Neverisky:** thing. Uh, it's

**Tyram:** rare.

**Luke Neverisky:** got fish and seashell motifs on it,

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Pretty

**Luke Neverisky:** which I don't know. Um, how much is a common uh armor?

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Uh hm.

**Luke Neverisky:** That wasn't on the list checker, so I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** that I will have to look up. Um, first I even look up like uh armor types. There's like a table

**Luke Neverisky:** guessing

**Justin Hale:** You're a table.

**Christopher Hooper:** shamware with all

**Luke Neverisky:** it's weird. The only light the only light armors are mariners that are uncommon. either then you just jump straight to

**Christopher Hooper:** the Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** rare. Uh oh, wait. It would help if I unfiltered from the word leather. Um I still that still remains true. The only light armor is

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh I am currently trying to use DND beyond and it is not very

**Luke Neverisky:** mariners.

**Christopher Hooper:** useful. Um I think I think plus one studded armor is fine. even though that's supposed to be a rare because it's only um

**Luke Neverisky:** For what it's

**Tyram:** What? Oh, I guess that would be less expensive than the clo

**Luke Neverisky:** worth, yeah, for what it's worth, it's the same cost as

**Tyram:** protection. That makes sense. That's weird because clo protection is

**Luke Neverisky:** Mariners.

**Tyram:** better, but it costs uh but it's like a cloer protection is better, but it's a rarity category less, which doesn't really make any sense to me.

**Christopher Hooper:** 1,500

**Tyram:** Like, poker protection applies to saves as well, but it's considered uncommon. So that's that's strange to me

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, very

**Christopher Hooper:** It's saying I don't know why it's saying

**Luke Neverisky:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** that. Okay, it's fine. For some reason, this like magic shop says studded armor plus one is gamechanging, and I

**Tyram:** as

**Christopher Hooper:** just don't really believe that.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I saw

**Tyram:** um I assume their logic is that anything that gives you a bonus to attack rolls or to AC is pretty significant. So that's what I assume they mean by game changing. kind of like how flying

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Tyram:** is like just it completely changes the way you could

**Luke Neverisky:** Why is

**Tyram:** like strategize about fights and

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, right, right. Um, that's fair. Yeah, actually that probably is rare. I forgot that plus one is like plus one to stats and not just like better

**Tyram:** stuff. it would make your so studded leather on

**Christopher Hooper:** armor, which is what we're interested in right

**Luke Neverisky:** it?

**Tyram:** its own would be like 12 plus your dex mod. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** studded leather plus one would be 13 plus your Dex mod. So it is it is it makes your AC

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, then I could

**Christopher Hooper:** now.

**Luke Neverisky:** settle for a common and then presumably it's

**Christopher Hooper:** So the studded leather just by itself is

**Luke Neverisky:** cheaper

**Tyram:** better.

**Christopher Hooper:** 45 gold.

**Luke Neverisky:** significantly. Perfect. And I'll do that

**Tyram:** I don't think I can afford it

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay,

**Luke Neverisky:** instead.

**Tyram:** right now, but I definitely will put cloak of protection on my wish

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Wish

**Tyram:** list for

**Christopher Hooper:** list.

**Tyram:** later.

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. Um, all right. Cool. And, uh, Taylor, did you want to do

**Tyram:** Um yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** something? Um, so, uh, there's a group headed back to the Veroonfall, um, to do

**Tyram:** Yeah, I think I'll join that

**Christopher Hooper:** experiments.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. What's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. So, Ma, uh,

**Luke Neverisky:** wrong?

**Christopher Hooper:** Brew and Silus head to the, uh, broomfall. Um, you see, uh, Scarlet

**Tyram:** group.

**Christopher Hooper:** there, and it sounds like she has set up like a experimentation uh, space in the cavern um, of the Roomfall and has been uh, running experiments in it. Um, and there's like a nice little like living space there. Um, he says, "Oh, hey. Uh, I wasn't expecting

**Justin Hale:** Nope. Make

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Uh, are we leaving? What's going

**Walden Briarhelm:** Do you do it

**Walden Briarhelm:** brown.

**Justin Hale:** You're not here, Silus. You're not here,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Silus or Liliana were here to hear this

**Justin Hale:** Liliana. They

**Walden Briarhelm:** conversation? Yes. I'm sure they would totally understand our

**Justin Hale:** would love it. They would think, "Oh my

**Walden Briarhelm:** obsession with

**Justin Hale:** goodness." They would be like, "Oh my goodness, you guys, you made brown and now you're making purple. This is

**Walden Briarhelm:** Brown. Oh, purple. I think that sounds good, too.

**Justin Hale:** amazing.

**Christopher Hooper:** Sure.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I will get to juice extraction. Right. So, the turtle who's big and strong is now doing a very uh dextrous movement with a syringe. He's manually creating raisins.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you two are deep in it. Uh, Silus and Scarlet are working on in interdimensional objects on their bench and uh yeah, y'all um y'all get set up. Um, looks like Silus was able to get some some like good glass work going and um yeah, y'all are good to go, I think. Anything else y'all want to prepare before the big showdown?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Are we all together at this point or are we still

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, it's up to you. Whatever you want to

**Justin Hale:** I mean, whenever we're done, we

**Walden Briarhelm:** split? Okay.

**Justin Hale:** would regroup, I would

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, in uh and her

**Justin Hale:** say. Do you need me to roll for acid

**Walden Briarhelm:** absence

**Justin Hale:** grapes?

**Christopher Hooper:** do. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** What a

**Christopher Hooper:** don't know. seems

**Walden Briarhelm:** question of me to roll for acid

**Christopher Hooper:** fine. Seems all

**Walden Briarhelm:** grapes. It's a new sentence.

**Justin Hale:** Like how many how many how many

**Christopher Hooper:** right. I think you all get

**Justin Hale:** grapes in the time that we've been doing this? How many acid grapes have we

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Justin Hale:** made? Oh, wait. We didn't

**Christopher Hooper:** How much acid did you

**Justin Hale:** did we did you buy? I can't remember now.


### [02:50:04]

**Christopher Hooper:** buy? You got a couple scrolls of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, there were 20

**Justin Hale:** Oh, we didn't actually buy

**Christopher Hooper:** acid splash, right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** each. I think we got five. Well, you're uh you are at you will figure out how to extract the acid from this group or just use it

**Justin Hale:** acid. Is that a thing I can

**Walden Briarhelm:** and activate it and uh fire the acid

**Justin Hale:** do?

**Walden Briarhelm:** into a vial or something. You you know, science it up.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I see. Oh, yes. This This is part This is exactly what I was thinking. Good. Good

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, I only repeated something. I heard you mumbling while you were sort of drunk from the brown earlier. A

**Justin Hale:** job. Yes, of course. Of course.

**Walden Briarhelm:** sobering up brain.

**Justin Hale:** Um, so, uh, yeah, let's do that with how many how how many grapes can one scroll

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** What? What's the conversion

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, well, you have Well, you

**Luke Neverisky:** What's your scroll to great?

**Walden Briarhelm:** rate?

**Christopher Hooper:** have five uh uses.

**Justin Hale:** make?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, it does 1 D6. So, I don't know if you want to flavor it like each grape is a is a

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** potential damage acid damage or however you want to flavor it. But you have five uses of

**Justin Hale:** It does not say how much acid it

**Walden Briarhelm:** I vote. It

**Justin Hale:** produces, but

**Christopher Hooper:** splash. It makes a five foot

**Walden Briarhelm:** makes Holy

**Justin Hale:** it's 5 foot sp so many

**Christopher Hooper:** sphere. It's

**Justin Hale:** grapes. All right. So, we're going to

**Christopher Hooper:** a lot of grapes.

**Luke Neverisky:** That is so many

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***.

**Justin Hale:** we're going to we're going to deju enough grapes to fill

**Luke Neverisky:** grace.

**Justin Hale:** one scroll of acid splash. So, like maybe a full bushel of grapes

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah, I think a bushel. But you have to throw like a handful at a

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** time to be meaningful.

**Walden Briarhelm:** don't think

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, cool. Why don't we say why don't we say one scroll is six

**Justin Hale:** Uh, why don't we just put the acid splash scrolls

**Walden Briarhelm:** it

**Justin Hale:** in the wrist

**Christopher Hooper:** grapes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. We will make

**Christopher Hooper:** What? That's stupid. Make

**Walden Briarhelm:** instead we will make turlet wine as you said earlier and you can just make acid

**Justin Hale:** thing? Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** it

**Walden Briarhelm:** sprayers make heaven even far more terrifying.

**Justin Hale:** Oh. We could. All right. New plan. We purposely We purposely make the toilet wine poisonous and give April taste of her own

**Tyram:** You completely volunteered to eat her

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, I believe

**Justin Hale:** medicine. No,

**Christopher Hooper:** um basically the great hall connecting uh like the the main entry to the forchart with the it actually even shows the once hidden emperor elevator um that goes to the top of the mountain and you can kind of get like where there is basically solid rock above the great hall. Um, which is probably like the map you

**Tyram:** All right. Who

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** which one of us has the best uh penmanship? And they can draw the uh the the route when the time comes. What check would that be? Would

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, it used to be

**Tyram:** him.

**Christopher Hooper:** you you creep to the office and you hear everything's laid out. Okay. So, they're gonna um they're going to draw the dragons in. Now, uh, what I'm going to try to do is logistics to get as much people out of the city because I think once all this goes down. Oh, wow. All right. Too many things. Olivia says one thing at a time. Okay. So, I need to find um maybe a a religious leader or something to to coordinate

**Ellis Taylor:** Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** everybody. Uh, what would Olivia do? Oh, yeah. The old tier the old tier leaders. Yeah, they they have all the connections and they still have pool amongst a lot of people. Okay, maybe tonight um we could I can go to one of the meetings and and get them to organize uh people into the tunnels and then once the s*** goes down, they can get out of the city. Yeah, Dr. Rock. Yeah, you got this. Okay. Um remember, you're not good outside this office. So, we're going to write down our speech to the to the person right now and then that'll work better. Okay. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Olivia. Um, yeah. And he it

**Ellis Taylor:** honey.

**Christopher Hooper:** sounds like he's planning this like

**Luke Neverisky:** innocent.

**Christopher Hooper:** fairly elaborate like um try to get as many like bystanders out of the city or like in a safer place when all when the s*** hits the

**Ellis Taylor:** That's good cuz we didn't plan

**Tyram:** Well, I guess we just assumed our plan would

**Ellis Taylor:** for that at all. We were just going to unleash

**Tyram:** work flawlessly and we wouldn't need

**Ellis Taylor:** dragons.

**Tyram:** to. I'm confident we're going to be able to do

**Christopher Hooper:** fan.

**Luke Neverisky:** I mean, really, why wouldn't

**Tyram:** good work here, guys. But

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, cool. Yeah. And if you want, you can you can sneak on

**Tyram:** Okay. Do

**Christopher Hooper:** by. Um, and we'll call it a

**Tyram:** any of you guys want to do the the speech

**Luke Neverisky:** it?

**Tyram:** you're doing? Because Chalk Rock is certainly going to f*** it

**Christopher Hooper:** night.

**Ellis Taylor:** I think he's got

**Luke Neverisky:** No, I believe in

**Tyram:** up. Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** him. Absolutely.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Well, Y'all you feel All right. um any

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** like questions before next session where we're just going to like it's going to be pretty continuous. So yeah, this was like the um calm before the storm I

**Ellis Taylor:** We got a bunch

**Christopher Hooper:** think

**Ellis Taylor:** of healing potions, right? Did everyone get distributed

**Christopher Hooper:** a bunch like How many did you get

**Ellis Taylor:** them a bunch?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I think I was only able to afford two.

**Ellis Taylor:** You by two you mean

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, it depends on which system of cost we were looking at because the one website was very expensive and the other website was manageable and I

**Christopher Hooper:** over? Well, if you use the the magic shop, then

**Ellis Taylor:** 12.

**Walden Briarhelm:** have what is

**Christopher Hooper:** that one has a has a adjusted one.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the price there?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, but you also have like four healers. Um, so I think it'll be fine. And the four

**Ellis Taylor:** God, we're so

**Luke Neverisky:** be

**Walden Briarhelm:** And I do have

**Christopher Hooper:** healers are really good at healing from what I've

**Walden Briarhelm:** three potions on me. So now I have

**Christopher Hooper:** seen. Oh yeah, you're fine.

**Ellis Taylor:** bad. I have a magic picnic basket. What's that?

**Luke Neverisky:** fine. Are those from Zach's

**Tyram:** you got from Zach's

**Christopher Hooper:** from from

**Luke Neverisky:** thing?

**Walden Briarhelm:** five.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I'm definitely going to eat out of my magic picnic basket. I get advantage on my next skill

**Tyram:** thing. I think I used to use a piece of my magic picnic basket

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** roll and an extra 10

**Tyram:** to save you that one time.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** HP. Yeah. Um, before we go into battle, I'm definitely gonna

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** eat out of this because I get an extra 10

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. Yeah. Um, cool. And, um, this will be, uh, nearing the end of Ark

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** 2. So, um, I think that there's like kind of a strong

**Luke Neverisky:** Where?

**Christopher Hooper:** direction towards Greyport, but y'all don't have to go that

**Ellis Taylor:** HP.

**Walden Briarhelm:** my.

**Christopher Hooper:** way. If you'all want to go another direction, let me know. Think about

**Tyram:** seem like the that's where

**Justin Hale:** M now that you the great port. I don't want to go

**Tyram:** like we need to go in order to do the ritual to try to reseal the dragon. So that seems like that seems like the thing to do

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, the dragon's in the orb,

**Justin Hale:** there.

**Christopher Hooper:** so we got

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes. Yeah. We've got to as long as we can find a good spot

**Tyram:** next.

**Christopher Hooper:** time.

**Ellis Taylor:** for Helisana to like chill

**Tyram:** Yeah. I mean, are

**Ellis Taylor:** while we figure out what to

**Tyram:** we are we just going to like straight up try to convince her to like like are we going to try to use like persuasion to get her to just like, you know,

**Ellis Taylor:** do.

**Tyram:** go on a sub or

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I was thinking that you would I was thinking that you would just

**Tyram:** something?

**Ellis Taylor:** write to uh Naomi and then she could like get an offer letter for her and I feel like it would be we don't have to do a lot of convincing at that point of

**Tyram:** That is

**Ellis Taylor:** like hell. So I was like, "Yeah, I could do a show every f****** night

**Tyram:** true. She is She is motivated by fame. So, yeah, getting a

**Ellis Taylor:** with free booze. Let's

**Tyram:** uh getting her own Vegas show might be enough of a enough of a draw for

**Ellis Taylor:** go

**Christopher Hooper:** It's pretty

**Ellis Taylor:** with bottomless mimosas.

**Luke Neverisky:** with auto. That was

**Tyram:** her.

**Christopher Hooper:** cushy. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** I look forward

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, that could work. Mold things

**Walden Briarhelm:** to combat.

**Christopher Hooper:** around. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** cushy.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah uh

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Greyport is also in the direction that the

**Tyram:** that the god.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Time to

**Justin Hale:** forever. That's kind of what you

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Ellis Taylor:** her. I've

**Luke Neverisky:** go.

**Justin Hale:** implied.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** made peace with it because it's come so close so many

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe I'll kidnap George again and then we can just like have the

**Tyram:** Well, you still have to fulfill

**Christopher Hooper:** same

**Ellis Taylor:** times. God damn it,

**Tyram:** George's mission. I mean, they're trying to like seal up portals and s***.

**Ellis Taylor:** George. Oh, yeah. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, but she doesn't actually care about

**Ellis Taylor:** true.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. That's

**Justin Hale:** Georgia is

**Christopher Hooper:** that. Yeah, that's

**Ellis Taylor:** My family's sick. That's all I care about.

**Tyram:** Yeah, but George is super incompetent, so

**Christopher Hooper:** George's

**Ellis Taylor:** Family.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** you kind of need to help

**Justin Hale:** safe.

**Ellis Taylor:** At some point, you do have to just let the new generation take

**Tyram:** him. No.

**Christopher Hooper:** mission. Frog

**Ellis Taylor:** over. Taylor got to pass the

**Tyram:** Terrible. There hasn't been a single problem resolved in this

**Christopher Hooper:** George.

**Tyram:** entire campaign. That wasn't us resolving it. There's no way we can entrust this to

**Ellis Taylor:** baton. Generation G, they can't handle

**Tyram:** George.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and one

**Tyram:** Also, we have the younger generation amongst our party here. I mean, Brew is like 10 years

**Christopher Hooper:** day 10 would be

**Tyram:** old. Oh, 10 is Oh, I thought you I

**Justin Hale:** Five 10 would be

**Christopher Hooper:** old.


### [03:20:04]

**Ellis Taylor:** it. It's

**Tyram:** thought you could make it to 20. My

**Justin Hale:** dead. Good

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** mistake.

**Justin Hale:** question. I don't think

**Christopher Hooper:** I think like uh okay. Uh why

**Ellis Taylor:** true.

**Christopher Hooper:** does eight is

**Justin Hale:** so. 60 years. That's not

**Christopher Hooper:** adulthood?

**Justin Hale:** right. That is not what I read last

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Why is it saying

**Tyram:** Have you guys been wrong about this this whole f******

**Justin Hale:** time. No. No. No. No.

**Christopher Hooper:** that? I think they're

**Ellis Taylor:** And we've just been with an actual child that we've been giving

**Tyram:** time? Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** like bombs to or like cream

**Tyram:** very

**Ellis Taylor:** bombs.

**Tyram:** precocious. Well, hey, honestly, the lifespan is whatever you say it is, to so it's

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** I was going on something much shorter. I think Justin and I were

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, there's like 10 to 20 or something. But why

**Christopher Hooper:** both Yeah.

**Tyram:** whatever.

**Justin Hale:** why can't I find that

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't know either. They say I'm saying they can live up to

**Ellis Taylor:** What are you a

**Christopher Hooper:** 60.

**Tyram:** Maybe it's like maybe goblins live such dangerous lifestyles most of the time

**Ellis Taylor:** goblin? Yeah, AI says 60.

**Tyram:** that it's kind of like like like an animal type of

**Justin Hale:** now?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Tyram:** framework where like they live this long in the wild but in captivity

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** they live up to 60 years

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, the domesticated

**Tyram:** old.

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I'm seeing a lot about

**Luke Neverisky:** brew.

**Justin Hale:** weird. Okay, we're gonna have

**Christopher Hooper:** So adulthood is eight. I think maybe that's where they're

**Ellis Taylor:** 60.

**Justin Hale:** to we're gonna have to punch up his age

**Christopher Hooper:** gonna

**Ellis Taylor:** Maybe you just aged

**Justin Hale:** then. Am I wrong? What do I have in my

**Ellis Taylor:** quickly. He's

**Justin Hale:** background here? Oh, no. My background

**Ellis Taylor:** 12.

**Tyram:** I would say Silus and Brew

**Justin Hale:** says 11.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. 11.

**Tyram:** have known each other for at least three years. Sounds about right to me.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So 30 is considered old age. I think like 60 is like

**Ellis Taylor:** the

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** A

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. It's like humans living to

**Christopher Hooper:** max max like very very very

**Ellis Taylor:** crap head.

**Christopher Hooper:** old. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** wire.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and I think it is also like harsh

**Justin Hale:** 100.

**Christopher Hooper:** lifestyle like goblins rarely live past S25

**Tyram:** It sounded like I was probably being insulting. I

**Christopher Hooper:** type of

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** really wasn't kidding. I do think that might actually be like a thing

**Justin Hale:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** thing. I mean, in this session, Brew almost drank poison

**Tyram:** here. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** and
