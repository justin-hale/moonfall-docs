**Luke Neverisky:** What

**Walden Briarhelm:** Making

**Tyram:** Oh no, it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** tacos.

**Luke Neverisky:** else? Guys, we

**Christopher Hooper:** Hello, it's

**Luke Neverisky:** invited

**Tyram:** over. Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** me. I feel like I haven't seen everyone in ages.

**Tyram:** well.

**Luke Neverisky:** him. I know. It's almost been like I haven't seen you guys since the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** last year.

**Tyram:** You know, one thing I don't get tired of is everyone saying, "See you next year." You know, in the last week of December, and I feel like it's been

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** since last year in the first week of January. It just it never gets

**Christopher Hooper:** exactly. It's so

**Tyram:** old every time I hear

**Luke Neverisky:** that's

**Christopher Hooper:** true. You took the

**Tyram:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** I know you were waiting for that, too. I just knew it. So, I figured I'd do it for you.

**Tyram:** Now that we've gotten out of the way, if someone else comes on the call and they

**Christopher Hooper:** bait. You really think Justin's not

**Tyram:** say it, I'm going to be

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** gonna say

**Tyram:** pissed. I figure he would actually.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** it?

**Tyram:** Uh, damn

**Luke Neverisky:** Probably

**Walden Briarhelm:** All right, we're I see we got to open up a bet

**Tyram:** him.

**Walden Briarhelm:** on this one. Does he do it? I think

**Tyram:** Who's going to take the other side on this one? He's

**Luke Neverisky:** not. I think he's

**Walden Briarhelm:** he's

**Tyram:** obviously going to do

**Luke Neverisky:** done.

**Walden Briarhelm:** gonna I don't know him as well as

**Tyram:** it. He leans

**Walden Briarhelm:** you guys. I'm just I would hope he does.

**Tyram:** into I think dad

**Walden Briarhelm:** That seems

**Tyram:** jokes. Oh well.

**Walden Briarhelm:** appropriate. My new recent

**Tyram:** I'm holding on to the vain hope that maybe Ted will just go to sleep like

**Walden Briarhelm:** favorite joke

**Tyram:** super quick and then maybe come in. But no, probably

**Walden Briarhelm:** was, "Yeah, that's what

**Christopher Hooper:** probably

**Tyram:** not. I don't

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** kids do." I heard a joke and

**Tyram:** know. Maybe he's tired. Maybe he had a tough day at the office. I don't know. I don't know

**Walden Briarhelm:** it was that

**Christopher Hooper:** not.

**Tyram:** what's going on with his

**Walden Briarhelm:** I days, man.

**Tyram:** life.

**Christopher Hooper:** It is kind of funny because like I feel like Ted is with us for most of the session anyway, so I'm not exactly sure, but I guess like towards the end they do bedtime and stuff. Um, and also I know how tiring it is, so it's not as

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't therefore I No

**Christopher Hooper:** easy. Yeah, exactly. Hey,

**Tyram:** That's a pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** Justin.

**Tyram:** s***** thing to say about Justin there,

**Luke Neverisky:** sympathy. Oh s***. Is he

**Tyram:** Luke. Yeah. Yeah. Just came on.

**Luke Neverisky:** on? Ah

**Tyram:** Oh. Oh, by the way, we can barely hear you

**Justin Hale:** You can barely hear

**Tyram:** a little better

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, how about

**Luke Neverisky:** man.

**Christopher Hooper:** now?

**Justin Hale:** I'm walking outside so probably going to lose

**Luke Neverisky:** And there he lost

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, that

**Tyram:** now. As was

**Luke Neverisky:** us.

**Walden Briarhelm:** timing was flawless.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** foretold.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. Can't say Justin. Dozens of letter when he says

**Justin Hale:** you. You know, okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** something.

**Christopher Hooper:** Good

**Walden Briarhelm:** Double

**Christopher Hooper:** work. Yeah, the weighted

**Tyram:** I got my dad

**Walden Briarhelm:** toeer.

**Christopher Hooper:** vest.

**Tyram:** a weighted vest for uh Christmas. He told me he wanted one. Um I asked him how much weight he wanted on and he told me 25 pounds, which I thought probably too much, but hey, we can always return it. It was too much and we had to return it. So, um I'm going to have to uh tag that out for a a lighter vest for him probably this

**Walden Briarhelm:** Why did he uh was Was there a reason he

**Tyram:** weekend. Oh, he just likes to do the old

**Walden Briarhelm:** wanted

**Tyram:** person thing and go to the Y and just like do laps around the the circuit there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** one? Oh, and he wanted to do it with a weighted vest. Got it. 25 pounds

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. H.

**Tyram:** Well, yes, obviously, but 25 pounds is a lot.

**Walden Briarhelm:** feels like a lot.

**Tyram:** Yes, it was more, I think, than he thought it was.

**Walden Briarhelm:** It doesn't seem easy. Is it

**Tyram:** Uh yeah, it's like distributed around the

**Walden Briarhelm:** evenly forward and back or is it more in the

**Tyram:** the vest, but um it was

**Walden Briarhelm:** chest? My lower back thinks that's a bad

**Tyram:** uh he uh felt the weight of it and

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** immediately knew that he had made a terrible mistake,

**Walden Briarhelm:** choice.

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, at

**Tyram:** but

**Luke Neverisky:** least he made that realization within a return period or

**Tyram:** yes. Yeah. So yeah, I mean ultimately it just cost him some time. uh running around that track, I guess. But oh

**Luke Neverisky:** something.

**Tyram:** well.

**Justin Hale:** There we go. So, I uh hardwired my gaming PC to my router and hardwired my

**Luke Neverisky:** Beautiful.

**Justin Hale:** Xbox to my router, and I'm running Moonlight streaming from my computer to my Xbox. Uh, it's nice. It is

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, so you're actually getting like more than 100 megabytes per second download

**Justin Hale:** crisp. Uh, yeah. So my my local network taps out uh not using the internet at 10 gig

**Luke Neverisky:** speed.

**Justin Hale:** throughput for each

**Tyram:** Glad for

**Luke Neverisky:** Damn, I really I

**Justin Hale:** device.

**Luke Neverisky:** pay for one gig, but of course nothing is hardwired. So like I get

**Walden Briarhelm:** The super

**Luke Neverisky:** 50, you know, megabytes at

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I

**Tyram:** you.

**Justin Hale:** uh I I spent money on our uh

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** networking stuff in this house. So all of our stuff is ubiquity. So, it's like a UniFi Dream Machine, the U7

**Luke Neverisky:** most.

**Justin Hale:** Pro uh Wi-Fi adapter. So, like the Wi-Fi that we get down, even with like 50 devices connected concurrently, I can push like 480 megabits per second on

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's a awesome flex.

**Luke Neverisky:** Damn

**Justin Hale:** Wi-Fi. It's

**Luke Neverisky:** it. Yeah, there we

**Justin Hale:** ridiculous. Yeah, it it costs that. It was It was expensive, but you get what you pay

**Walden Briarhelm:** And Moon Moonlight is

**Luke Neverisky:** go. I'm going to

**Justin Hale:** for.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a you stream I'm looking at it and I'm not sure I

**Luke Neverisky:** ask

**Walden Briarhelm:** fully get it, but it's you can stream your PC games to your console because you said you were streaming to Xbox.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. So, um I have a an application on my computer on my gaming computer called Sunshine, which is the that's responsible for streaming the game from my computer to the other devices. And then Moonlight is the client application that you can get on everything. Have it on my phone, my Steam Deck, my Xbox, all that. Um, so, uh, it works really well on Wi-Fi, too. But, uh, it's like next to no latency when you're hardwired on both sides, mainly because it's a a full connection with no drops and

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. There

**Justin Hale:** no fighting, you know, Wi-Fi traffic for one device. So, I'm about to

**Luke Neverisky:** you go.

**Justin Hale:** drop like what uh500 or $600 more on our on our networking stuff so that I can hardwire uh our bedroom and the kids'

**Luke Neverisky:** So, I have a question because I'm I know

**Walden Briarhelm:** Awesome.

**Luke Neverisky:** I know s*** about this. My house has a every room in my house is has a cat 5 like output or cat 6 or whatever the f***. I don't

**Justin Hale:** rooms.

**Luke Neverisky:** know. Um, and there's a box downstairs where all the wires kind of coales. Um, one of my friends mentioned that I can get what's called a switch and basically, is that the right terminology? Basically have my wireless router hit the switch and then the switch plugs into that box which then is that

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. You got it.

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Justin Hale:** Um, I'm going to show you what I have.

**Walden Briarhelm:** 100%. Show me what you've got. It's

**Justin Hale:** See if I can get there. And

**Walden Briarhelm:** nice that you have a box with all the wires already ran for

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Justin Hale:** then yeah, home runs

**Walden Briarhelm:** you.

**Luke Neverisky:** know. I've lived there for three years and I haven't taken advantage of that and I just It's one

**Justin Hale:** are

**Tyram:** I assume is

**Walden Briarhelm:** You'll do it and then

**Luke Neverisky:** of those things that I keep meaning to

**Tyram:** uh busy with baby stuff at the moment, right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** what

**Luke Neverisky:** do. I think so.

**Christopher Hooper:** That's

**Justin Hale:** nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. My My wife said she needed 10

**Justin Hale:** Just 10 minutes to

**Christopher Hooper:** minutes. No, with my with

**Justin Hale:** herself.

**Tyram:** Gotcha. He did leave

**Christopher Hooper:** Astrid. But you left anyway.

**Luke Neverisky:** You hear me? Like ask a

**Tyram:** anyway. We are keeping alley waiting is all I'm saying.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Oh, yeah. I I know Taylor, you're eager to talk more about network routing, but I guess for Alli's

**Tyram:** I'm just looking out for her.

**Luke Neverisky:** question.

**Christopher Hooper:** sake, we can find other

**Ali Leonard:** What? What am I

**Tyram:** Yeah, it's like I could sit here and listen to all this talk about

**Ali Leonard:** doing? Girl, I can zone out with the

**Tyram:** uh network in your house all night, but Ally, I know can't stand

**Christopher Hooper:** topics.

**Ali Leonard:** best of them, but when you guys talk about f****** Pokemon, I would So,

**Tyram:** it.


### [00:10:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** Did somebody

**Ali Leonard:** I'm just kidding. I really don't care. I have a puzzle in front of

**Tyram:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** We have to fix

**Ali Leonard:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh Luke's um home internet speeds. It's

**Ali Leonard:** I

**Tyram:** well. Oh, but Justin, you

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. We

**Christopher Hooper:** very

**Tyram:** said you were going to show us. Did you ever

**Christopher Hooper:** important.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I thought you were

**Walden Briarhelm:** Let's see that switch. I

**Luke Neverisky:** do.

**Justin Hale:** saying that you did not to see

**Tyram:** show

**Walden Briarhelm:** want that. I want to see that land

**Christopher Hooper:** and

**Justin Hale:** it. It's

**Ali Leonard:** agree.

**Christopher Hooper:** switch.

**Justin Hale:** not letting me share.

**Tyram:** I feel neutral about it, but since we're having to wait a little

**Walden Briarhelm:** switch.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** while anyway, it's as fine as anything

**Christopher Hooper:** Good.

**Luke Neverisky:** What makes a man go

**Justin Hale:** Oh my gosh, it's going to make me quit out of the meeting again.

**Tyram:** else.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Starting to question this

**Tyram:** That's a good

**Walden Briarhelm:** networking. Is it network or is it

**Luke Neverisky:** neutral?

**Ali Leonard:** I see

**Tyram:** point. It was just boasting about the uh the power of his network, but it does seem

**Walden Briarhelm:** browser? I'm It looks like I'm getting one frame per second right now for him. That's not very good.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, you see, you have

**Ali Leonard:** frozen.

**Christopher Hooper:** to open the moonlight to get to the switch so you can plug in your home

**Tyram:** to

**Christopher Hooper:** set and get the speeds, you

**Ali Leonard:** If your crystals aren't charged, you're not going to get any of those speeds

**Luke Neverisky:** Turns

**Christopher Hooper:** know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. You needed to say AI more. I feel like then you would have

**Christopher Hooper:** That's

**Walden Briarhelm:** been fully ready to pitch. What is

**Luke Neverisky:** I am sharing my entire

**Ali Leonard:** though.

**Walden Briarhelm:** this? You're you are sharing you're

**Luke Neverisky:** screen. It's just the

**Ali Leonard:** Wow, you are sharing your entire screen.

**Walden Briarhelm:** sharing the sharing

**Luke Neverisky:** banner. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** true. I'm I'm clicking stop

**Luke Neverisky:** it. Oh, good job. Nice

**Christopher Hooper:** sharing and it's not working. Oh, now it

**Walden Briarhelm:** banner. You're muted again.

**Luke Neverisky:** work.

**Christopher Hooper:** worked.

**Luke Neverisky:** Also, Justin's over here bragging about his internet, but he's still in

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mr.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Here we go. No, dude. I got this new browser. I'm using I used Arc forever and then Arc they they're doing away with it. So, I switched over to Zen and all the all the things have to be allowed again. and all the passwords have to be saved. But um anyway, so

**Luke Neverisky:** DSL. Oh.

**Justin Hale:** this is my router, right?

**Luke Neverisky:** That doesn't look

**Justin Hale:** Um so this is this is easy boy that uh your internet comes into. And then I have basically all of my devices plugged into this. Currently, what I'm going to buy is

**Luke Neverisky:** like

**Justin Hale:** uh is it this one?

**Christopher Hooper:** I am Ron

**Justin Hale:** No, I think it was 400. Not in any

**Tyram:** That was crazy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** like to invite you to the pants

**Christopher Hooper:** Burgundy.

**Justin Hale:** good order. Here we go.

**Tyram:** Um, I think it's been 10 years since Anchor Man 2 came out. which was like 10 years after Anchor Man 1 came

**Walden Briarhelm:** party. Oh.

**Luke Neverisky:** I think there more

**Christopher Hooper:** You know what's infectious laughter is watching um Steve Carell's

**Luke Neverisky:** than it's so good.

**Christopher Hooper:** audition tape for Anchor Man on YouTube.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's really

**Justin Hale:** Okay. This

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's a lot of ports, my

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. That's a lot of

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Justin Hale:** one This is the

**Tyram:** out.

**Walden Briarhelm:** guy.

**Justin Hale:** guy by So these little Can I make this bigger? Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** ports.

**Justin Hale:** See these little crazy ports over here? 10 gig ports. Um, so the router can plug a a 10 gigabit connection straight to this switch and then it can pass that locally to all of these.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** And then these four here that are the like separated out on this graph, the PoE++ makes it to where it can pass 2.5 gigs over that versus just a gigabit on these others. And then these are also powered. So I can run um I can run off of these to my uh access points for Wi-Fi and they don't have that. That's all they need is the plug and then they're powered and

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Huh?

**Justin Hale:** everything. I think they run what is POE++ is like 52 watts. Uh something like that from the actual plug itself. Pretty crazy. Yeah. Then from that up into the attic, I'm going to put this dude in there. This is going to run uh one of the access points and then all of the connections into our bedrooms.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Do you do you do you have like ceiling

**Luke Neverisky:** slicks.

**Justin Hale:** This thing

**Walden Briarhelm:** mounted uh access points? So that is

**Justin Hale:** looks Yeah. Uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** what would run it. Yeah, I see. Do you have your own

**Luke Neverisky:** Gotcha.

**Justin Hale:** yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** CCTV then? Not not

**Justin Hale:** Uh I do not know. We use Wise

**Walden Briarhelm:** yet.

**Justin Hale:** C. Uh these dudes. I got two of these in the

**Luke Neverisky:** Huh?

**Justin Hale:** house mounted just like that.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Yeah, it's pretty discreet. Just looks like a fire detector basically.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hello.

**Justin Hale:** Yep, you do

**Luke Neverisky:** Huh. Nice.

**Justin Hale:** indeed.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, no, that's

**Justin Hale:** Goodness, that's

**Luke Neverisky:** cool.

**Justin Hale:** fun. Me and my wife can play co-op

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, I'm just

**Justin Hale:** games in any room of the house through uh

**Tyram:** Oh

**Luke Neverisky:** tell your wife plays golf games with

**Justin Hale:** Steam. She does

**Tyram:** yeah, more

**Walden Briarhelm:** Who's

**Justin Hale:** indeed. We're playing Enchanted right now. I in Enchanted. It's like an overcooked but with more of like a

**Tyram:** games. Okay, so is it like you have the kitchen stuff from

**Walden Briarhelm:** better?

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Justin Hale:** fantasy spin to

**Tyram:** Over Coach, but like other like in related chores that you have to do?

**Justin Hale:** it. Um, so you have like steaks to cook for the food part, but then you can make potions and then you can make potions into the stakes. Uh, and then it gets complicated with front of house stuff. So like the people are like different uh races and

**Ali Leonard:** Hello.

**Justin Hale:** you have to set them up uh for diversity. So like two of the same races can't sit next to each other. They have to be separated and they have like their crest like a sun or a moon or whatever it is um like set them accordingly. And then there's uh there's magpies that come in and try and steal the food if it sits too long. And then there's these little like ninja cats that come in and try and steal the money out of your

**Christopher Hooper:** What are you talking

**Tyram:** That sounds like a lot of spinning

**Christopher Hooper:** about?

**Justin Hale:** bank. Talking about I'm talking about the uh

**Tyram:** plates.

**Justin Hale:** the information you leaked about tonight's

**Tyram:** No, that's a whole

**Luke Neverisky:** Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** What are you even talking

**Tyram:** genre of games. Like it's I don't know what you would call it like

**Justin Hale:** session.

**Tyram:** uh stress core because I don't see how they're fun to play at all.

**Justin Hale:** That is a great

**Tyram:** But I've seen a whole bunch of games like that. Like Overcooked, I guess, is kind of like the the

**Christopher Hooper:** about?

**Tyram:** the genre definer,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, dude. Overcooked.

**Justin Hale:** question. Yeah, it's a

**Tyram:** but

**Luke Neverisky:** Overcook pisses me off so much because I'm just like, who designed this kitchen? This

**Justin Hale:** coincidence.

**Ali Leonard:** What's

**Tyram:** Well, yeah. I mean, like you're on like

**Luke Neverisky:** kitchen is clearly inefficient.

**Tyram:** floating rafts that have to like align before you're allowed to move stuff

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** happening?

**Tyram:** between different parts of the

**Luke Neverisky:** I know. I'm just like I reject this game because I wouldn't have set this kitchen up anyway.

**Justin Hale:** Enchanted is um less stressful than Overcooked in my

**Tyram:** kitchen.

**Justin Hale:** opinion. There's a lot going on, but like I hate the the overcooked thing of like the environment moving and just like randomly messing with you. I hate

**Tyram:** Well, I understand that like if you're going to have different

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Tyram:** levels, there has to be some meaningful distinction between them. And like from a gameplay perspective, like they're going to make it harder, not easier, right? But but yeah, it's one of those things

**Justin Hale:** Sure.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** where like if you're like trying to understand the internal logic of the like restaurant, it it's absurd, right? Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** You know,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** that would be an interesting restaurant design where the concept is that it's really hard to cook there.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** well, man. I just would love to go to a restaurant. The waiter's like, "Okay, we're going to f****** try, but we cannot make any promises." You know, we got to wait for the particle to accelerator to stop

**Justin Hale:** What the

**Tyram:** running before we're allowed to like move stuff between parts of the

**Justin Hale:** f***?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** you get hired on at that kitchen. They're like, "All right, sign all of these releases. You uh you can't sue us if a swinging stove knocks you off of

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** the knocks you off of the treehouse and you fall to your

**Tyram:** kitchen.

**Justin Hale:** death. If you get stuck in the portal, we're not held liable.

**Tyram:** If a yeti reaches through the window and pulls you out into the the tundra, then like that's not on

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey, if your restaurant's near the

**Justin Hale:** Yes.

**Tyram:** us. Well, the in addition to like

**Christopher Hooper:** tundra.

**Justin Hale:** Um the streaming

**Tyram:** the way the kitchen is set up, a lot of times the location is pretty ridiculous as well.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Like you're on a river or like, you know, you're over like a volcano or something like

**Christopher Hooper:** How is

**Justin Hale:** client. That's true.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh Christina's

**Justin Hale:** Um, so Christina is better. About three days in,

**Tyram:** that.

**Justin Hale:** Olly got it. Um, I don't think so. I haven't felt great, but like I haven't had any of the symptoms they've

**Tyram:** Well, as long as you're okay for the next like 2 and 1

**Christopher Hooper:** yet?

**Justin Hale:** had.

**Tyram:** half to 3 hours, that's all that really

**Justin Hale:** Um, mine's been mine's been much more muted from there. So, I don't I don't think I have

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Oh my

**Justin Hale:** the flu because they had full on like they still have fever

So all the peop all the like vaccines that were for it and stuff like are not the right strain and it's like one that we haven't had in a while. So everyone's immunity is like gone. Um which is what's making it like a really

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, it

**Luke Neverisky:** Huh?

**Christopher Hooper:** bad flu

**Walden Briarhelm:** swept through a couple different people I know's households and

**Christopher Hooper:** season.

**Walden Briarhelm:** did the same five to seven day hop from one person to the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yikes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** next.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I'm I'm trying so hard to hold out. I'm hoping that like what I have is some sort of exposure to it and not just like full on getting it. I'm going to be so mad if like I get like actually full on sick

**Walden Briarhelm:** to

**Justin Hale:** this weekend because I've stuffy nose, headache. I've been tired, but like once I'm up and I, you know, blow my nose and do a nutty pot and take some aspirin like I'm good to

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, this is the first time that Thea's gotten like hardcore sick, too. So, that's been rough because she's never like she doesn't know what this

**Walden Briarhelm:** mild.

**Justin Hale:** feels like. And she was pushing almost 104 degree

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh jeez, that's not

**Justin Hale:** fever. So, there were some nights where one of us is hopping in the car. So, we got it down thankfully. The Tylenol made it made it go down

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that's wild because you would start

**Justin Hale:** to 99 or whatever. So, we were good,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh F.

**Luke Neverisky:** like hallucinating at that point, right?

**Christopher Hooper:** good. Jeez.

**Justin Hale:** but Oh, she started to That's why That's why we knew that she had a high fever because she was asleep and she woke up thinking that um uh Christina's mom was

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** here because she was like, "Nana, I want Nana." And we're like, "Dude, it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Perfect.

**Justin Hale:** I got sick. when they did. So, we went to Columbus uh after Christmas. We did like a a little mini vacay in Columbus. We went to Cosai and Legoland

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** and all those different places. And I knew that going to all

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Justin Hale:** these kid places, I was going to get sick. So, I was like hyper vision. I'm not touching anything. If I touch something, my

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** hands stay far away from my face. Um I

**Christopher Hooper:** Lots of handwashing.

**Justin Hale:** was a freak about it. Yeah. And as soon as we got home is when Christina got sick. And I was like, "You 100% got sick

**Tyram:** see touching

**Justin Hale:** at the museum. No doubt about

**Ali Leonard:** Ready?

**Justin Hale:** it." Yeah. So, I've I've been quarantined uh for the longest time. I was quarantined to the main floor by myself. So, uh have you guys heard of the show Wandla on Apple TV?

**Christopher Hooper:** Nope.

**Justin Hale:** So, uh, it's a kids show that's based off of a book, and

**Tyram:** There. Hey.

**Justin Hale:** me and Olly watched almost the whole thing because he and I were

**Ali Leonard:** There you

**Justin Hale:** camped out down here before he got sick. And then he ended up

**Christopher Hooper:** Good

**Justin Hale:** getting sick before we finished the last two episodes.

**Ali Leonard:** go.

**Justin Hale:** So, rather than watch it without him, I went out and bought the damn book. And uh in the last two days I read through the whole first one and I'm like what 10% through the second one and I bought

**Christopher Hooper:** job. Nice.

**Justin Hale:** it this afternoon. They're good. They're good

**Christopher Hooper:** What type of show is

**Justin Hale:** little kids books. Um it's a it's a CGI animated uh show made by uh what's his name? John Lacier. So the the director guy that used to make all

**Ali Leonard:** Hallelujah. Thank you.

**Christopher Hooper:** it?

**Justin Hale:** the Pixar movies. Um so it's got like sort of a Pixar-ish feel. Um, and the premise of the whole

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** show is that uh this little girl is in um what's called a sanctuary. It's like an underground shelter. Um, and she's growing up in that shelter with a

**Ali Leonard:** Never

**Tyram:** You got cut off

**Walden Briarhelm:** She's here.

**Justin Hale:** robot as like basically a mom out of the sanctuary

**Tyram:** in the middle of saying

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, which is funny cuz you kind of sounded like a

**Justin Hale:** up. Well,

**Tyram:** robot.

**Justin Hale:** Oh.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Um,

**Ali Leonard:** know.

**Luke Neverisky:** robot.

**Justin Hale:** welfare. And she wants to leave and she's trying so hard to get out and like find other people because she's the only human she's ever known. Uh, and then um something breaks into the sanctuary and starts blowing stuff up. So, very quickly she has to leave. Um, and everything that she had been like training for in the sanctuary is basically like to rebuild society and go out and, you know, expose once it's been gone. So like here's the things that you can look out for and like

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Justin Hale:** lions and tigers and here's how you survive and stuff. So when she gets out into

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Justin Hale:** the world, it's not the world that they had left. So

**Ali Leonard:** I've seen clicks like that. It's really

**Justin Hale:** um, like crazy. It's a fun show. It's a cool little show. Ollie liked it a bunch.

**Walden Briarhelm:** And you guys also watched all of Avatar the Last Air Bender, right? Oh,

**Justin Hale:** No, I tried once again

**Walden Briarhelm:** okay. All right.

**Justin Hale:** and he was like, I don't want to watch that right now.

**Ali Leonard:** cute.

**Tyram:** Who cares what he wants? Watch Avatar the Last Airman. Watch it without him. You You'll enjoy it watching it without him if you

**Walden Briarhelm:** He's going to hear you talking about

**Justin Hale:** So, I don't doubt it. Yeah, since I've never seen it before, if I'm going to watch it, I thought it'd be a cool thing to

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Tyram:** have. It probably would be, but if he's

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Justin Hale:** watch with

**Tyram:** going to be obstinate about it, you need somehow you need to watch it. It's the most important thing

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm going to this party where we're all going to watch Avatar and eat

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Walden Briarhelm:** pizza. It's going to be the best. But only I'm going. It's a terrible choice. Don't do

**Justin Hale:** him. Somebody else has a here, right?

**Tyram:** here.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that. What's

**Luke Neverisky:** What's

**Justin Hale:** Wasn't there somebody else in this group that hasn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** that?

**Justin Hale:** seen Avatar? Okay, that's what I

**Ali Leonard:** I watched it because it was a homework assignment and I did

**Walden Briarhelm:** You got

**Ali Leonard:** it. No, I mean it was a homework assignment from

**Walden Briarhelm:** you got graded on watching that. Oh, yes. Yes. Well, you're

**Luke Neverisky:** up? and airport here. I never did my

**Ali Leonard:** here. That was years

**Tyram:** Yeah. Well, I guess it's pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** passing. A

**Luke Neverisky:** homework assignments growing

**Justin Hale:** thought.

**Ali Leonard:** ago. But thank

**Tyram:** clear which one of you is the best and it's

**Ali Leonard:** you. Finally, it's been

**Tyram:** Alec.

**Walden Briarhelm:** A+. Finally,

**Luke Neverisky:** up. I know my

**Tyram:** Well, I just I hope you enjoy

**Walden Briarhelm:** it's been

**Tyram:** being there at the bottom of the totem pole because you are stuck there and you're never

**Ali Leonard:** said.

**Tyram:** getting

**Luke Neverisky:** place.

**Justin Hale:** Oh gosh.

**Tyram:** out.

**Justin Hale:** Um, Luke, if you want to get your wife into gaming, uh, co-op games on Steam are the best way

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. Do you have a

**Justin Hale:** to do

**Luke Neverisky:** recommendation? Okay, please

**Justin Hale:** it. I have tons of recommendations. I can send you a

**Ali Leonard:** We like it takes

**Tyram:** Yeah. Isn't that I was about to ask about

**Luke Neverisky:** do.

**Justin Hale:** list. There's a bunch of it. Takes two is

**Tyram:** that one. Isn't that the one where it's like basically about like a couple that's about to get a

**Ali Leonard:** two. Yeah. And she is a total

**Tyram:** divorce?

**Justin Hale:** great. Yeah. So,

**Ali Leonard:** b****. He is a

**Tyram:** Yeah. He's a total doofus

**Ali Leonard:** twofist, but she's a b****. And so like the entire time, cuz we're almost done. We have like an hour left. And I was just like, I'm so sorry

**Tyram:** though.

**Ali Leonard:** she said that. And then he would say something and I'm like, okay, well that was a little stupid that he said that. So I hope they get


### [00:30:00]

**Tyram:** I honestly I've watched a playthrough of it and it's like I think they did a good job making it like I guess let's call it realistic because they

**Ali Leonard:** divorced. Oh yeah. No, absolutely. It's obviously the kids

**Tyram:** do both suck. Yeah. Well, no it's not because like they're bad parents. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** Damn.

**Justin Hale:** talking about. It

**Ali Leonard:** fault.

**Tyram:** mean, neither of them batted an eye about traumatizing their

**Justin Hale:** always

**Ali Leonard:** That's the joke

**Tyram:** child by like gutting their favorite toy in front of them with the

**Ali Leonard:** though. Like every time the kids on

**Tyram:** intention of making the kid cry. They're bad

**Ali Leonard:** on screen I go like it's all your f****** fault,

**Tyram:** people.

**Ali Leonard:** dude. She can't hear

**Tyram:** That poor kid. She's been through

**Justin Hale:** Don't you know situation that's

**Ali Leonard:** me. It's always her fault. But when we're

**Justin Hale:** always the kid's

**Ali Leonard:** done with that, we're going to try what's the other one they did? Split

**Tyram:** enough. Oh, okay. So, I read

**Ali Leonard:** fiction.

**Tyram:** a uh I read a comic book one time where like there's this one character who they were like kind of showing the life story of and like her power was that like she always

**Justin Hale:** fault?

**Tyram:** knows when people are lying and like um it causes you know trouble apparently like it causes issues for the parents from time to time and like her dad sits her down one time and he's all like um he's telling him that like hey your mom and I are getting a divorce but it's not your fault. And then like her but then like she's all like, "Yeah, I can always tell when people are lying even when they don't think that they are." And I was like, "Whoa,

**Justin Hale:** Good night.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, way to break that wall down.

**Tyram:** damn." But she doesn't like say anything to the dad. Like he was trying to like he did believe it, right? But he was just apparently wrong about it, which

**Ali Leonard:** Oh,

**Tyram:** was heavy

**Walden Briarhelm:** Nice. Damn.

**Tyram:** blow.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I hope things are going well over there, Toeer.

**Ali Leonard:** Have you played split fiction,

**Justin Hale:** Uh, no, we have not. We bought it um over the Christmas break when it was on crazy

**Ali Leonard:** Justin?

**Justin Hale:** sale, but we've not had a chance to play it yet. We bought it for the

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, that's what we play

**Justin Hale:** Switch.

**Ali Leonard:** on

**Justin Hale:** on switch one or switch

**Ali Leonard:** when Oh, no,

**Tyram:** Well, I mean, yes,

**Justin Hale:** two. Does it play on switch one? How does How does it look on

**Ali Leonard:** no, no, no, no, no. He's getting split fiction for a different console. We played it takes two. We play it takes two and switch one.

**Tyram:** obviously.

**Justin Hale:** there? Oh, okay. Gotcha. Yeah, I was going to say I think

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, for SH2.

**Justin Hale:** Split Fiction was only available for uh Switch

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. And I think it's available on like

**Justin Hale:** 2.

**Ali Leonard:** either the Xbox

**Justin Hale:** It's on all platforms.

**Ali Leonard:** whatever Xbox whatever we

**Walden Briarhelm:** of the Xbox whatever. That's that's how I feel. I don't have one anymore and I'm like there's too many

**Tyram:** Xbox has done a catastrophic

**Justin Hale:** Yeah,

**Ali Leonard:** have. At least the PlayStation kind of

**Tyram:** job of naming their

**Justin Hale:** there's Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** goes in

**Walden Briarhelm:** versions.

**Justin Hale:** there they don't care about Xbox anymore. Have you heard about everything

**Ali Leonard:** order.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Justin Hale:** that's going on with Xbox right now? They're

**Tyram:** consoles.

**Luke Neverisky:** Nope.

**Justin Hale:** essentially just letting it go. They don't they don't care to

**Ali Leonard:** Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** There's no more

**Justin Hale:** continue with it anymore. I mean, there was They just don't care about it. Like, once they started making Game Pass and they were like, "Oh my god, we can print money by renting games to people. We don't care about the rest of

**Ali Leonard:** rippies. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** money.

**Justin Hale:** this." So, they've essentially gutted Xbox and and they're keeping

**Ali Leonard:** That makes

**Walden Briarhelm:** and marketing.

**Luke Neverisky:** That makes

**Justin Hale:** the name just for uh Game

**Luke Neverisky:** sense. My Xbox is a Game Pass

**Justin Hale:** Pass. Yeah. Well, my Xbox is a Moonlight machine now because it's it's powerful

**Walden Briarhelm:** What

**Justin Hale:** as s***. It's got um the

**Ali Leonard:** sense.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the hell?

**Luke Neverisky:** machine.

**Justin Hale:** prioritized wireless frequency for the controllers and it's capable of outputting at, you know, 4K 120 uh FPS. So, like it's doing half of the work for the game streaming. So, um, it's it's a fantastic streaming device for my

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. That's much better than my

**Justin Hale:** for my gaming

**Luke Neverisky:** 10-year-old first generation Xbox One that sometimes takes 10 minutes to boot

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hell yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** up.

**Justin Hale:** computer. Yeah, they Xbox also did themselves no favors with their stupid naming with Xbox One uh, and then Xbox Series, but then also the iterative ones in between of like the S and the X. And it's like why

**Ali Leonard:** Wasn't there a 360 in

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, the Xbox Series

**Justin Hale:** why' you why'd you do that guys? Why'd you do

**Tyram:** Like I genuinely have a hard time remembering which one is the most

**Luke Neverisky:** X

**Ali Leonard:** there? Recent?

**Tyram:** like up

**Luke Neverisky:** 360. One's a dorm fridge. That's all

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Justin Hale:** that

**Tyram:** to-date.

**Luke Neverisky:** remember.

**Justin Hale:** series is the like the newest generation. So there's the series S and the series

**Ali Leonard:** Get

**Tyram:** Okay. Which one of those like

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** X.

**Tyram:** what's the difference between those

**Justin Hale:** Um, so the S

**Ali Leonard:** out.

**Justin Hale:** is always the like lower quality and the X is

**Tyram:** two?

**Justin Hale:** always the higher quality. The X is what they

**Luke Neverisky:** that's

**Justin Hale:** call the fridge. That thing right

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** That large black

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** there. It's just little it's just a

**Walden Briarhelm:** blob looks like a Sonos speaker. Oh, it's only because it's

**Justin Hale:** monolithic square. Yeah, that's essentially what it looks like. Uh, it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** blurry.

**Justin Hale:** honestly it's really good engineering though. Like the way that they have it set up, it's a

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't want

**Justin Hale:** perfect little fluid dynamic

**Christopher Hooper:** to interrupt this. Uh, but do you all want to play some D and

**Tyram:** Let's do

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Do you want to play some

**Tyram:** that very

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** machine. Yeah. Are you

**Christopher Hooper:** D? I am finally ready. Yes. Uh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I have a DND question that came

**Christopher Hooper:** Zack in the back.

**Tyram:** thing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** up in the back. So

**Justin Hale:** ready?

**Ali Leonard:** landing?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Justin kept saying moonlight and sunshine. And I've seen the old joke online about how if a vampire can't be in the sun, but the moon is just reflecting sunlight, is that any different? Uh, I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are on

**Ali Leonard:** like Indian in real

**Tyram:** in DND or like in general?

**Walden Briarhelm:** that. Well, I I guess indeed. I don't know if there's any application

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, um, I think that the moon god was actually um

**Ali Leonard:** life.

**Christopher Hooper:** pretty aligned with vampires. And I think the sun god was

**Ali Leonard:** Does the light affect vampires

**Christopher Hooper:** very anti-

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, where you do

**Ali Leonard:** in D and

**Christopher Hooper:** vampires. Yeah. Sometimes depends on your

**Walden Briarhelm:** it? I have no

**Ali Leonard:** D? We played straw and I just never

**Tyram:** Oh, sorry. What was the question? I was

**Walden Briarhelm:** idea. So, it's DND

**Christopher Hooper:** lore. Yes. I And I believe that there's

**Tyram:** Um, it

**Walden Briarhelm:** based. Does light have any effect on vampires in D and

**Justin Hale:** All

**Christopher Hooper:** like

**Tyram:** specifically has to be daylight. Like some spells

**Walden Briarhelm:** D?

**Ali Leonard:** remember.

**Tyram:** um produce light, but vampires don't care. If the if the

**Ali Leonard:** But in straw there's

**Tyram:** spell specifically says daylight, then it does hurt

**Ali Leonard:** no light so it's like who

**Christopher Hooper:** I think

**Ali Leonard:** cares? Yeah. But I just meant

**Christopher Hooper:** there's a DND spell cold

**Tyram:** vampires. There is a DVD still called Daylight.

**Ali Leonard:** like sunlight.

**Christopher Hooper:** daylight.

**Tyram:** There's also a sunburst and sunbeam that specifically

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** say they deal daylight. Um, so yeah, those f******

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, it's because the sun hates

**Tyram:** vampires. Yeah, the sun

**Christopher Hooper:** vampires.

**Tyram:** does specifically hate vampires.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. The sun rises every day and says, "f***

**Tyram:** I also thought it would be a fun bit of lore that uh the Winter King

**Walden Briarhelm:** Awesome. Got it.

**Luke Neverisky:** vampires.

**Tyram:** specifically hates vampires because they're kind of like the opposite of him in a lot of ways because um he goes around at night to benevolently bestow gifts in people's homes whereas vampires stalk the night and harm people and uh they are not allowed to enter people's homes. So

**Christopher Hooper:** The only gift they give at night is

**Tyram:** like he f****** hates

**Ali Leonard:** That would make sense by Caspian

**Christopher Hooper:** vampirism. One of the worst you gifts you could give to

**Tyram:** vampires. Yeah. which is a pretty s*****

**Ali Leonard:** says first lieutenant since she has like a necklace of vampire

**Luke Neverisky:** What a great

**Ali Leonard:** teeth.

**Christopher Hooper:** people. Oh s***. All I got for Christmas was vampirism.

**Tyram:** gift. That's the thing that made

**Luke Neverisky:** gift.

**Justin Hale:** I keep on giving. And we're

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** the Winter King uh see uh Caspian as a good recruit was

**Ali Leonard:** like her blood lust for

**Tyram:** her hatred of vampires. Well, like she goes around, does good deeds, she also hates vampires. He could

**Ali Leonard:** vampires. Tick, tick, tick all the

**Tyram:** not get those like get that contract out fast

**Ali Leonard:** boxes. And he doesn't really have a lot of

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Pirate. All

**Tyram:** enough, you

**Ali Leonard:** followers.

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, thank you guys for answering about Moonlight Sunlight. I I don't know my vampire lore of DND

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, the cool thing about lore in

**Walden Briarhelm:** at

**Christopher Hooper:** a campaign, especially as a DM, is you can make it

**Tyram:** know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** all.

**Christopher Hooper:** all up. Um, but we already have prior that vampires

**Justin Hale:** Our

**Ali Leonard:** Exact some are better

**Christopher Hooper:** um maybe have a moon thing and some are pedophiles.

**Ali Leonard:** vials. Blackwell specifically

**Tyram:** Well, Blackwell is a pedophile, I

**Ali Leonard:** and anybody with the name

**Walden Briarhelm:** Magic.

**Justin Hale:** pedophiles. Well, all all vampires are

**Ali Leonard:** Blackwell. I mean

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Okay. Um I didn't

**Tyram:** think.

**Christopher Hooper:** see that but

**Tyram:** Well, I guess the relative age of a vampire is

**Ali Leonard:** probably just

**Tyram:** always drastically higher than any mortal they might have a relationship with. So

**Ali Leonard:** saying and some of them some of them try the blood of 12y

**Tyram:** in that sense, yeah, they are kind of uh robbing the cradle no

**Ali Leonard:** olds.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Tyram:** miraable age gap no matter what,

**Ali Leonard:** So

**Tyram:** you know, for the vampires

**Justin Hale:** bad.

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean, like some

**Walden Briarhelm:** this conversation.

**Christopher Hooper:** some vampires might have like, you know, a weird age

**Walden Briarhelm:** Amazing.

**Ali Leonard:** So, I mean,

**Christopher Hooper:** gap while not being pedophiles

**Ali Leonard:** some

**Christopher Hooper:** cuz you can I think you can have a relationship with a

**Tyram:** relatively. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** might be like

**Christopher Hooper:** 32year-old and it's like kind of weird.

**Ali Leonard:** 952. It's still a baby

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Well, well, I guess it does occur to me

**Luke Neverisky:** relatively

**Ali Leonard:** though.

**Tyram:** that there might be other long lived things in the fantasy setting that are perhaps even older than the vampire. Like an elf could very easily

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, a dwarf could be a young

**Tyram:** be older than like a human who got turned vampire, you

**Luke Neverisky:** speaking.

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. A goblin. That's just Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** vampire who could be older than a young vampire, too. But if you see a goblin and a vampire

**Tyram:** know?

**Ali Leonard:** god. Always always something wrong. You


### [00:40:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** together, that's gross. Always bad.

**Ali Leonard:** need to save that goblin.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** I mean, any relationship with a goblin is a bad

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's

**Justin Hale:** Hold on, hold

**Ali Leonard:** I said save the

**Walden Briarhelm:** But it's not just the Australian

**Justin Hale:** on, hold on

**Christopher Hooper:** I thought we had some beautiful family dynamics going

**Walden Briarhelm:** man.

**Justin Hale:** now.

**Ali Leonard:** goblin. Absolutely. All goblin lives

**Tyram:** relationship.

**Christopher Hooper:** on. Um, okay. So, you know,

**Ali Leonard:** matter. Someone doesn't agree with

**Christopher Hooper:** um, we're going to dive in. Um, people have been a little

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** busy, um, over the over the month or so. And we're going to start in the market ward where we find Liliana and Ma. Currently, uh they are in Ratty's Pand um where uh Bernardo is teaching how to make some some

**Ali Leonard:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** pizza with um and Liliana are enjoying it as they see

**Ali Leonard:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** um a young dwarf pass by or um they see Chalk Rock passing by and he chimes in and says, "Hey everybody, how uh how's it going. Everybody doing well? No

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** uh

**Tyram:** The chalk rock age like 20 years. What the

**Christopher Hooper:** no uh funny business,

**Tyram:** f***?

**Christopher Hooper:** right? And

**Walden Briarhelm:** We are just learning to make Better.

**Luke Neverisky:** just

**Christopher Hooper:** uh and this um this isn't unusual to your characters, but maybe unusual to the players as you see a very um a very confident uh chalk rock walking

**Luke Neverisky:** Nope.

**Christopher Hooper:** in. chest held high. Um, and he's been uh basically running this city with uh

**Luke Neverisky:** Heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** Grim Jaw for the past uh few weeks uh pretty

**Ali Leonard:** Is he taking

**Ali Leonard:** steroids

**Christopher Hooper:** You don't believe so? He's been working a lot with Olivia.

**Ali Leonard:** on intonation and presenting

**Christopher Hooper:** Um and Yes. and working

**Ali Leonard:** himself?

**Christopher Hooper:** out. Yeah. So, uh, I'd like a couple pies for the boys in the, uh, the, uh, police office. If, uh, if you can whip that up

**Ali Leonard:** It's

**Tyram:** Rock chalk rock is like Patrick Warbertton

**Ali Leonard:** worse. Yeah. Like it's somehow

**Tyram:** now. Like what the

**Justin Hale:** is order for

**Ali Leonard:** worse. Squeak them. Squeaking. Squeaking.

**Christopher Hooper:** there,

**Tyram:** f***? Somehow you found

**Ali Leonard:** Squeaking.

**Tyram:** a way for me to like this character even

**Christopher Hooper:** in a different

**Tyram:** less.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I assume that you want the all meat

**Justin Hale:** Cusco.

**Christopher Hooper:** way. Oh, yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** That's it. Do you know I


### [00:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Justin Hale:** Spark shop guy hates brown

**Ali Leonard:** die? Do you kill my new friend now that I've

**Justin Hale:** so he must die.

**Ali Leonard:** finally found somebody that worships my god? I'm so mad at you. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, machine God

**Ali Leonard:** If he turns out to be the big bad of me so

**Christopher Hooper:** die. Uh but I didn't I didn't introduce myself. I'm Stacy. This is my shop. Uh we build um we're we do a lot of like fabrication stuff. So if you ever need anything like fabricated, welded together, or anything, let me know.

**Justin Hale:** Tony.

**Ali Leonard:** then

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah, we got that LA here. Um cool. Well, see you

**Ali Leonard:** yeah absolutely I'll be there

**Christopher Hooper:** tonight then. Cool. It'll be cool to have a Cooper. All right. Uh well, I gotta

**Ali Leonard:** 100%.

**Christopher Hooper:** get back to this project. I'll see you later. All

**Ali Leonard:** Great. Look, there's like a tear going down her face because it's like the first time somebody said that in a long

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** time. She's like, "Great. I'll see you

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ali Leonard:** later."

**Christopher Hooper:** something. Uh, Hela Sana, give me a perception

**Tyram:** I like how Stacy seems to like endear himself to the whole party,

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Tyram:** but he's like Bru's like number one

**Christopher Hooper:** check. They don't even know it

**Walden Briarhelm:** Just

**Justin Hale:** You must

**Ali Leonard:** immediately. Have we tried brown

**Christopher Hooper:** yet.

**Tyram:** enemy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** just an engine, bro. Kill

**Tyram:** He was just an engine, bro, because he's dead and doesn't know it now.

**Walden Briarhelm:** him.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, I got a

**Ali Leonard:** pizza?

**Christopher Hooper:** 20. Great.

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so, uh, something that you've been hearing

**Justin Hale:** die.

**Christopher Hooper:** a lot around the city is, um, a lot of the haunts that used to not have music, there's now, um, a little bit of smooth jazz that you've

**Luke Neverisky:** Morning.

**Christopher Hooper:** seen. um play especially restaurants in the marker ward. It it hums and it seems to have a a rehabilitating a rehabilitating effect on many of the raers. Um seems like introduction to um bulk and smooth jazz some of the um more calming but enjoyable music um has um has stabilized them and allowed them to reintegrate into society. Um, you've noticed that there seems to be a little bit of a a uneasy ceasefire between the upper and higher portions of the High Forge. Um, Helana still seems present somewhere in the deeper reaches of High Forge. Uh, the Underlake still is basically shut off. um the food production there has basically gone off a cliff there. No one can no one trust the water um or anything to be edible that comes out of it. Um so uh you've noticed yeah a lot of that has been happening on the hood. Um, you said you you worked a lot with rehabilitating the city and I think uh you noticed that um people still come and go between the layers, but it's it's kind of these like folks that have um you you knew from your time as Helisana from the height from the um rock scene. Um, but they're able to almost like code switch as they go to work or spend time with their families, but people occasionally sneak off to the to the lower to the lower echelons and enjoy a rock night or two. Um you also see that um throughout your your regular activity that there is the the merchants aren't as busy as they were before. Um they are doing a lot of work to try to reestablish like farms in the countryside um to be able to provide food for the city, but the fact is there's just not as many people in the city, which means there's not as many mouths to feed. Uh the uh the production and export of um of uh violescence has continued and um there have been some really uh strong efforts to continue that mining even with the sometimes disruption by the by the raers.

**Luke Neverisky:** Interesting. Okay. So, there are Okay. So, there are basically full-time residents of the of Deep Within High Forge on the um under lake there. There are people that moonlight, so to say, there go there and do their own thing, but in their day jobs, they actually have families and whatever. And then there are folks that are just converted for lack of a better word just completely don't even like stay clear

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** away. They're basically normal.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. Um and um you have been working a lot in the

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** pizza shop, but uh when you have time away from learning how to make uh incredible picacia uh bread, different types of bread sticks, um your own uh I I want to say you develop your own pizza style here. Um what do you think that pizza style would be?

**Walden Briarhelm:** It is not very popular but uh I I have a vegetarian pizza that I am

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And um

**Walden Briarhelm:** fond of.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think the big question is the crust. What style of crust are you running

**Walden Briarhelm:** I uh do not have a very large mouth. It does not

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Ooh.

**Walden Briarhelm:** open wide. So I prefer cracker style

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Thin thin almost like

**Walden Briarhelm:** crust. I have heard the customer

**Tyram:** Did you just say cracker style crust on a pizza? You f******

**Walden Briarhelm:** say that spin is

**Ali Leonard:** It's his

**Walden Briarhelm:** in that it is not

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. That is a

**Christopher Hooper:** flatbread. It is a thing, isn't

**Tyram:** freak. It's a f****** Lunchable. What

**Walden Briarhelm:** very

**Luke Neverisky:** thing. It is a thing

**Ali Leonard:** pizza. It's ma

**Christopher Hooper:** it?

**Tyram:** the

**Luke Neverisky:** though. No, it's a thing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** popular. It is thin and

**Luke Neverisky:** like a

**Ali Leonard:** style. Some would

**Luke Neverisky:** cracker. Some would

**Ali Leonard:** say it's been said in many

**Walden Briarhelm:** crunchy. You

**Christopher Hooper:** Let's see. Oh, apparently that's a there's another style of Chicago

**Tyram:** f***?

**Christopher Hooper:** pizza that Chicago tavern style pizza is

**Luke Neverisky:** say

**Ali Leonard:** reviews. So they kind of just do the extremes.

**Christopher Hooper:** apparently like cracker like crust and

**Walden Briarhelm:** understand? Very thin.

**Ali Leonard:** Then it's either a soup bowl

**Christopher Hooper:** square. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Sometimes this feels like Chicago does things just out of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** or a cracker.

**Tyram:** spite, you know, like we're

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Yeah. Pizzas.

**Justin Hale:** f*** you. I'm from

**Ali Leonard:** Thank you everybody.

**Christopher Hooper:** They

**Tyram:** gonna

**Ali Leonard:** Every Chicago's first

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, and another thing, um, when you have some free time, you and your, um, you and, uh, Bernardo and, um, Litu do

**Ali Leonard:** words

**Christopher Hooper:** some research and you,

**Justin Hale:** Chicago.

**Christopher Hooper:** um, have identified some folks that have heard of the Fallen Moon um, outside Greyport um, in the sea near there. Uh, it seems that there are witnesses that saw it like land off the coast, a huge explosion. Um, and it's now like fairly shallow there. Uh, people will sometimes like visit the site. Um, and there's been some re some people that say you can see uh the fallen. Um it it appears that it's taken a human form almost like a fallen angel's uh form um off the coast. Uh and so these are some little tidbits you picked up from customers as you've asked around and and gotten to know people. Um and it seems like um yeah, should be a short jaunt. You might be able to order a boat from Greyport and uh you know check it out. Um there's a little island nearby uh known for its coral reefs. Um and um yeah, might be something to check out

**Walden Briarhelm:** This is good news. My customers are very

**Christopher Hooper:** later. Yeah. Nothing nothing to get the tongue wagon

**Walden Briarhelm:** talkative.

**Ali Leonard:** very

**Christopher Hooper:** like a cracker style vegetarian

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Ali Leonard:** specific. Very

**Christopher Hooper:** pizza.

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's a sentence. That's a sentence. Hey, when

**Luke Neverisky:** right. That's the key to my

**Walden Briarhelm:** you're recording this part, make make a point to bold that.

**Luke Neverisky:** heart.

**Christopher Hooper:** bold. Uh some other tidbits you've

**Ali Leonard:** specific.


### [01:00:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** collected as you've seen the city or change. Um the iron claws have are now branding themselves as the iron hands. uh with the help of some clever tattoo work. Um you now see uh that um and they they they currently work as basically the um enforcers around the city. Um so far okay. Uh it was a little rough at first. Um there was a little bit of like uh let's figure out what we need to how we interact with each other. But um you know most of the people that were still in the city had basically created life and equilibrated to ironclaw, you know, led life. And so really this this softening of the claw to a hand was um was a welcome return to to uh the Iron Forge that they enjoyed. Um so that seemed to be pretty good. Um now it's at this point we jump to Brew and Silus. Um they find themselves after um a few weeks they have found Helga's apartment and um they are um they have led to believe that there's quite a few notebooks. Apparently Helga was a a viciferous journaler as long as um as well as um who knows what's going to be in there. Uh you see inside uh you see just outside the apartment there's this she basically took the like uh historic brownstone of the commons. Um an absolute gem of an apartment. Uh three stories even even like Olivia has a nice place. This place is like in our money would be like tens of millions of dollars because it has been like immaculately maintained for thousands of years. Um has like the original artistry um that and she took this when the as her

**Ali Leonard:** What a

**Christopher Hooper:** residence uh when they when they took over the

**Tyram:** So people would be at

**Ali Leonard:** b****.

**Tyram:** least a little mad if we just like burned it

**Christopher Hooper:** city. Yeah. Yeah. Probably. I mean, whatever. f*** around and find out,

**Tyram:** down. I don't know. We'll come up with some way to like tarnish her legacy like or like I don't do something to like postumously make her mad, I guess. Whatever. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** You want a rumor spread? I know a little

**Tyram:** So, but we're looking for these

**Ali Leonard:** girl.

**Tyram:** journals. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Tyram:** So, um I I guess Silas is probably uh trying to find any of those journals that he can and trying

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Tyram:** to research uh what Helga knew about the dragon orb to see if she knew how to like destroy it or

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Tyram:** seal it or just deal with our uh our evil dragon that we have trapped inside who we still need to deal

**Christopher Hooper:** right. And uh Justin, would you be looking for

**Tyram:** with.

**Christopher Hooper:** anything in particular in her

**Tyram:** Oh, and money. I'm also looking for for for money

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** apartment?

**Justin Hale:** Um, I mean, obviously, yeah, I'm just looking for any journals,

**Luke Neverisky:** What?

**Justin Hale:** um, because who knows what's going to have specific information that we need. So, uh, probably just like full

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Tyram:** that

**Justin Hale:** on, uh, like what what's the word I'm looking for? Uh, like a mole. Just rooting around. If I find anything that's like a textbook or something, I'm just throwing it into a pile in the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yeah. Uh why don't you give me both investigation checks?

**Tyram:** Oh, well,

**Justin Hale:** middle.

**Tyram:** maybe I should give Brew the help action. That might work a little

**Justin Hale:** I only

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I'm gonna we're gonna we're going to do

**Tyram:** better. I have a minus

**Justin Hale:** have a plus four instigation.

**Christopher Hooper:** separate separate ones as you both um look through the

**Tyram:** one. All right. All right. Uh

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** equipment. All right. Um, we will start with the

**Justin Hale:** 19

**Christopher Hooper:** 11. Um, you at one point uh so so you both find many things. Actually, we'll start we'll start with the

**Tyram:** 11.

**Christopher Hooper:** 19. Uh, Brew, you find an interesting journal in in the living room. Um, it's all very well organized. Uh, and you see a a reading chair by the fireplace. Um, and it looks like she was researching um a lot of the disruptions in reality. You see some books uh references um by a few physicists, a few um uh archinists that focus on on space-time fabric, stuff like that. And there's one one note that you see uh that she gathered is it says this. It says deep in the mountains to the north there's a rumor of a giant peoples larger than humans that live at the peak of a mountain. My sources tell me of a cave um a cave that disrupts the fabric of reality itself. And within that cave are they they found this ore that has a unique effect on the fabric of reality. My sources say that the tribe is able to meld or work this stone for their own ability to build a starship and have since launched a starship by imbuing it with a soul. And she has a note that this needs some more attention. Um and she and

**Justin Hale:** No

**Christopher Hooper:** this is under a section called reality stones. Um Silus, you uh you make your way to her bedroom door. Um and I would I'd like you to roll a constitution saving throw.

**Tyram:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** Uhoh.

**Christopher Hooper:** But

**Tyram:** hell. Five.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay, let me get my dice. Why is it so hard to get dice?

**Tyram:** because it doesn't want you to hurt

**Justin Hale:** Don't do

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So you um you feel as you turn the trigger or sorry

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** well it will be a trigger but as you turn the knob it triggers

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** this mechanism that it first does a small little prick in your hand and then immediately shunts several spikes into your hand and you start feeling poison um leak into your hand.

**Tyram:** Oh. Oh. Um, I'm immune to poison, I think, because of my

**Christopher Hooper:** Um. Oh, nice. Cool.

**Tyram:** cloak. Let me double check that to be sure, but I think that's the

**Luke Neverisky:** Ow. Then you don't feel

**Tyram:** case. Sorry, I can't see where I put the

**Justin Hale:** Thank

**Tyram:** DMG. I had the players handbook nearby. I didn't think I need a DM, but I

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Tyram:** was wrong.

**Luke Neverisky:** s***.

**Christopher Hooper:** You have resistance.

**Tyram:** Um, okay. Is it doing poison damage or is it giving me the poison

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Uh both

**Tyram:** condition? Okay. Well, I should have

**Christopher Hooper:** um Okay, cool. Okay, great.

**Tyram:** resistance to the poison damage at

**Christopher Hooper:** Um so uh you you feel like

**Tyram:** least.

**Christopher Hooper:** um uh what a you get let's see uh 11 points uh of damage um that's already cut

**Tyram:** Is that already cut in

**Christopher Hooper:** in half and and includes the the piercing damage.

**Tyram:** half?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, uh, give me a medicine

**Tyram:** Okay. Hell. Okay. At least I'm a little better at that. Oh, I got to reroll my net one. Become a net 20.

**Luke Neverisky:** All right, Dr. S. You

**Christopher Hooper:** check. Nice. Wow. Okay, cool.

**Tyram:** Okay. I love the halfling luck thing where I just don't have to keep

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah. Wait, it went from a one to

**Tyram:** that

**Christopher Hooper:** n 20. That's insane. That's That's

**Tyram:** ones. It

**Luke Neverisky:** go.

**Christopher Hooper:** perfect.

**Tyram:** did. I mean, I could have used it a minute ago,

**Christopher Hooper:** um you um you

**Tyram:** but we'll see how this goes.

**Christopher Hooper:** don't know I wouldn't say that you are like super proficient with like poisons and stuff but you know through your times and schemes and work honestly that there are poisons that um can leave a a traceability um in you Um, and uh you feel like this poison is not just like like corroding at at your your flesh. You feel like it is inserting something with you too, like a a trace. Um, feels like something you should check out later. But let's stick with it. Now, um inside you see, um you're able to open the the door and um you see that there is a a small study next to her bed. Um and you see a few um journals. Um they are categorized by year.

**Justin Hale:** Oops.


### [01:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and one of the ones you pick up is the year um that the Sisphus circle was destroyed. You're able to flick through it and it takes you back uh to her side. You see that she was um trying to obtain this orb. Um around the time you you you see this note from her that says, "I must have the orb." My mother said it would be the only way we were respected. But mother, there are other ways to gain respect. But this last thing I will do, not because you deserve it, but because I do. Later, it links to this role. She bismerches your uh Cisphus circle crew. um noting the job she gave to you, but notes at the end that while it looks like it looks like uh f*** uh Bart Bartllo Bart Bartholomew, is that what it is? No, let me see. Sorry. Let me see. looking into the journal. You see, uh, yes, you see it looks like Bartleby and Bugg were able to escape into the sewers. When I went back to the rest of the bodies, it looks like Sander was gone. Um, the rest are dead and we made sure of it.

**Tyram:** Brew, this is

**Justin Hale:** One

**Tyram:** important.

**Justin Hale:** second. All right, hold on. I'm I'm I'm peeing on some

**Tyram:** Oh, well, okay. Good idea. But like you'll want to hear

**Justin Hale:** things. Okay, hold on. I can't really stop in the middle. Hold

**Ali Leonard:** just bring it with

**Tyram:** this. Okay. Fair. Fair. By.

**Justin Hale:** on.

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Tyram:** Okay. So, but just to frame this, I'm pretty sure I have a deadly poison

**Luke Neverisky:** just watching

**Tyram:** coursing into my veins. And that's not what I want to tell

**Luke Neverisky:** me.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, all right. I don't think me

**Tyram:** you. Probably not. But just let

**Justin Hale:** paying will help with

**Tyram:** me know when you're done peeing. God damn

**Justin Hale:** that. Okay. All right. I'm almost done. All

**Tyram:** it.

**Justin Hale:** right. All right. I'm I'm

**Tyram:** Yeah, thanks

**Justin Hale:** almost I'm like shaking as I

**Christopher Hooper:** Penis still out.

**Tyram:** for the

**Justin Hale:** She like shaking it

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay.

**Tyram:** visual.

**Justin Hale:** up. We're good now. All right. Go

**Tyram:** Sander might still be

**Justin Hale:** Daisy.

**Tyram:** alive. It said that. Okay, so this is her journal. She said she went back to where to the park afterwards when all the others were

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm

**Tyram:** killed if their body wasn't

**Justin Hale:** What? All right. Um, all right. What do What do we What do we

**Tyram:** there. I I don't know.

**Luke Neverisky:** out.

**Tyram:** Um Okay. I I'll see if there's any

**Justin Hale:** do? Keep reading. Read forward. Does it say anything else about

**Tyram:** more mentions. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. So, I I flipped forward. Is there anywhere mention of there's

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh you see

**Tyram:** Sander

**Christopher Hooper:** that um afterwards it mostly talks about this order of St. George appears to

**Justin Hale:** it?

**Christopher Hooper:** be some sort of dragon hunting society. Um,

**Tyram:** anywhere? Oh, yeah. These were those assholes who tried to stop us from stealing the orb, which in retrospect maybe we should have listened to, but they didn't have to be dicks about it is the

**Luke Neverisky:** That's the plan.

**Christopher Hooper:** but uh you see um you you flip through, you see that there is an entry that um she had sent some people to try to find their sander, but the the trail went cold in in

**Tyram:** point.

**Luke Neverisky:** Y

**Tyram:** Does it say where they like how like does it uh list out like the clues that they had found? like maybe like a trail that we can maybe try to pick up

**Christopher Hooper:** Graport. Um they checked the um uh the bar that y'all went to

**Tyram:** on the cogen steam.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cogenstein um a few times. Scoped it out. Didn't see him there. Um but um and you know scoped out the zoo, scoped out haunts uh wherether Sander worked as a a baker uh for a little bit loading flower. Um but yeah, it's a big city and hard to find and no leads.

**Tyram:** R through. I think we need to move up our trip to Greyport. The ironclaws weren't able to find through Sander, but what if competent people were to look?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's a good

**Tyram:** I meant us, you

**Justin Hale:** idea. Who are we going to get that can do that? You

**Tyram:** a******. Well, we knew

**Justin Hale:** think? Oh, yes, of course.

**Tyram:** there Sandra. We might pick up on something that they

**Justin Hale:** Us. That is

**Tyram:** missed. All right. Okay. So, we were going to go

**Justin Hale:** true. This is true.

**Tyram:** there anyway, but yeah, we need to get there sooner rather than

**Christopher Hooper:** It's at this point you hear smooth

**Tyram:** later.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I love

**Tyram:** Yeah, I guess we'll just like kind of

**Justin Hale:** this

**Tyram:** groove to it a little

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** one.

**Christopher Hooper:** jazz

**Tyram:** bit. Where's that smooth jazz coming

**Christopher Hooper:** downstairs.

**Tyram:** from?

**Luke Neverisky:** whispers.

**Justin Hale:** Um, I'm going to grab like the next couple years

**Tyram:** Yeah, throw them into the

**Justin Hale:** of the journals just to be

**Tyram:** hole. Like if you like unfold the per the portable hole, we can just like throw them all in

**Justin Hale:** safe. Oh yeah, throw them in the pee

**Tyram:** Actually, that was a 30. Sorry, I got my inside check wrong.

**Luke Neverisky:** It really That's kind

**Christopher Hooper:** he he is definitely afraid that you are going

**Ali Leonard:** on.

**Christopher Hooper:** to accept his polite invitation to stay for dinner on what is obviously supposed to be a a very private date. He likely had to do a lot to get this

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Tyram:** Okay, that kind of makes me want to stay more, but now I'll I'll

**Christopher Hooper:** together. All right. Uh,

**Tyram:** leave.

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. So, y'all got some stuff headed out. Um, and so it's um several weeks

**Luke Neverisky:** of

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** later, y'all are at family dinner.

**Tyram:** Did I ever get my poison um extracted if it was

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, you're

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you you died. Is that your funeral? Sorry, did I say


### [01:30:00]

**Tyram:** weeks later?

**Christopher Hooper:** dinner? Family funeral.

**Tyram:** s***, man. That is

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, no. because

**Tyram:** a bad end for Silus. Wow.

**Christopher Hooper:** you're able uh so well to identify it, you're able to um get it extracted out. Um you found it wasn't

**Luke Neverisky:** dead.

**Christopher Hooper:** actually harming you. Um but it appears to be some sort of interesting poison magic that uh basically puts a tracker in you. Um, so, um, you believe that it probably, um, you know, somewhere there's something that like send a little alert that her room had been

**Tyram:** knowing that. Can I like drop the

**Christopher Hooper:** opened. Oh, extract

**Tyram:** poison in like a urinal or

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Um, you got a 20. Yes, you can.

**Tyram:** something? Yeah. Okay. I want them to like trace the the intruder to like

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah. Yeah. So

**Tyram:** something some place that's very unpleasant for them to go

**Christopher Hooper:** you're able to work with the physician to extract it out um and uh release it into to the sewers. Um okay, cool. Uh so you all gather um I'm going to say

**Tyram:** to.

**Christopher Hooper:** every Thursday. Um, now we'll say every Saturday morning um while uh you y'all all gather for family brunch. Um, and at this point y'all check in with one another. Uh, Olivia's not able to make this one. She uh was called away for business in the countryside. There appears to be while she still is retired, she occasionally pitches in to settle some disputes, look into some concerns, and that has her called away. Um, but we were able to connect with her if you need to. Um, and at this point, Scarlet uh has gotten your notes about the

**Ali Leonard:** Heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** stones and says, uh, kind of opens up the breakfast as as you all kind of are relaxing and says, um, so Brew, these reality stones, they could be used for the, um, the pocket village. I think I think we could use them to stabilize the internal entity.

**Ali Leonard:** Heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh yes, that's what it calls for here in these in these diagrams. Some sort of stabilizing agent uh so we can transfer u materials, people's um within this this isolated reality. It's would get us a far way towards that our goal here if if we got those. I know it's a hike, but ju just saying. Um, she looks at you,

**Justin Hale:** All right, confirming what I already knew. Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** bro. I know it's it's obvious,

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** but I say it out loud because I would think it's a hard trek for us all to go. I think we would need some help. Or what do you I don't know. I think we could all go. Or does anyone have any else? Anything else they want to work

**Luke Neverisky:** You said there's a hike.

**Christopher Hooper:** on? Oh. Uh,

**Luke Neverisky:** I love a good hike.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Tyram:** So, we're going back to the Goliath

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Uh, it says there's a near there that

**Tyram:** Village. I f****** hate that

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** village.

**Tyram:** place.

**Luke Neverisky:** not that

**Justin Hale:** Well, Silus and I need to stop at Grayport

**Christopher Hooper:** That is um that's not on the way at all, but okay.

**Tyram:** That is significantly farther. But actually, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** first.

**Tyram:** Um, we found out something important. Um, somebody that we um, a friend of ours from Graveport might be alive, someone

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, well that's Hey.

**Tyram:** we thought was dead. I I

**Luke Neverisky:** bad.

**Tyram:** I wasn't really talking to you. Um, but Scarlet, but yeah, just sure. Like I I don't mind you knowing but I was

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Tyram:** really talking to the group here more

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. I I don't care

**Tyram:** so Oh okay. was a

**Ali Leonard:** Scarlet, you're great. Scarlet, you're

**Christopher Hooper:** anyway. I do

**Tyram:** little hurtful that you don't care,

**Ali Leonard:** great. Scarlet, you're

**Christopher Hooper:** care. Thanks. I don't know. I'm just

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm I'm trying to read the

**Luke Neverisky:** You're doing

**Christopher Hooper:** situation. Oh, thanks everybody.

**Tyram:** but don't get inspired

**Ali Leonard:** great. You should make stuff. That's

**Tyram:** to make

**Luke Neverisky:** great.

**Ali Leonard:** her whole

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, that's my whole thing. Like this pocket village

**Tyram:** anything.

**Ali Leonard:** thing. She's been working really hard on it and I haven't done like anything

**Christopher Hooper:** I've been working months for

**Tyram:** Well,

**Ali Leonard:** except research a little bit and help a little

**Tyram:** Well, I um I'm gonna activate

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that's her whole thing.

**Ali Leonard:** bit with

**Tyram:** psychic going with everybody with Scarlet. Um okay.

**Justin Hale:** jealous.

**Ali Leonard:** Scarlet or

**Christopher Hooper:** on

**Tyram:** Um without Scarlet. Um I I'll think in

**Ali Leonard:** without

**Tyram:** everybody else. Okay. Scarlet's alternate self like someone alternate Scarlet was involved in creating a time gun

**Ali Leonard:** This is a different

**Tyram:** which blew up the f****** universe. We have got to do everything we can to

**Ali Leonard:** scarlet. This is a different

**Tyram:** make her not want to build a time gun.

**Ali Leonard:** Scarlet.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, some alternates can actually be better, you

**Ali Leonard:** Okay,

**Tyram:** Okay,

**Ali Leonard:** point and she's doing the

**Tyram:** that's fair. But still, you know, we're

**Justin Hale:** We're

**Ali Leonard:** research I don't want to do.

**Tyram:** talking about blowing up the universe. So, I feel like we need to like, you

**Luke Neverisky:** know.

**Ali Leonard:** I'm never paranoid except when I'm

**Tyram:** know, be a little paranoid about it

**Ali Leonard:** always

**Tyram:** here. Except then,

**Luke Neverisky:** He's stepping on

**Justin Hale:** just except

**Ali Leonard:** paranoid. Who's framing me all the

**Tyram:** right?

**Justin Hale:** for

**Tyram:** Okay. Anyway, so just, you know, just so you know, that's why I'm like trying to harsh her vibe a little bit on the whole inventiveness

**Ali Leonard:** time? Okay. I mean, she's following plans.

**Tyram:** thing. Okay, sounds like we're almost done with these. We need to make sure she doesn't move on

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, we just

**Ali Leonard:** We have another project in

**Tyram:** to a next project that's, you know, building the time

**Ali Leonard:** line. Don't worry about

**Tyram:** gun. Okay, good, good, good. Okay, good. Okay, that that's that's what we need to do.

**Ali Leonard:** it. There's so many

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** won't so many projects in the pipeline.

**Ali Leonard:** projects that I'm just so

**Ali Leonard:** He

**Christopher Hooper:** kitchen and starts making scrambled eggs. Um Kevin is uh is

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Ali Leonard:** knows.

**Christopher Hooper:** currently like jumping on the table. Um just like up and down. Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing. Um, and he's being chased by Pepsi, who um is currently jumping after him and nearly destroying the

**Ali Leonard:** Absolutely. Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** of scrambled eggs along with some freshly uh

**Ali Leonard:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** cooked bacon uh fresh from the oven and lays it out and

**Ali Leonard:** yeah.

**Tyram:** All right,

**Luke Neverisky:** great. That's pretty conservative actually.

**Tyram:** just I f****** hate it to be

**Ali Leonard:** just him that you

**Tyram:** honest. That's true, but I also hate the change

**Ali Leonard:** hate. I mean, it was nice of Olivia to try, but I don't think

**Tyram:** as

**Ali Leonard:** it's kind of working out for me. But it's fine because I don't live here and he's not my mayor, prime minister. What is

**Tyram:** well. That's true. I mean, that's one of all the more reason for us to hit the road soon, you

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** he?

**Tyram:** know, get out to Greport.

**Ali Leonard:** So, there's also was telling me something that he had heard about the moon.

**Tyram:** Greyport? So, yeah, we could go there and f*** over

**Justin Hale:** either.

**Ali Leonard:** Maybe they don't live

**Tyram:** the guys who screwed you over.

**Ali Leonard:** there. That's just where the ra

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** You sound very sad

**Ali Leonard:** was. I don't

**Tyram:** When's the next

**Walden Briarhelm:** about

**Ali Leonard:** know. I only hear about the underground race because that's the only one I'm allowed to be in.

**Tyram:** race? I'm going to think over at Brew. Just Brew and be

**Walden Briarhelm:** this.

**Tyram:** like, "Brew, Ellen needs to be

**Ali Leonard:** So

**Tyram:** exacted." This calls for mischief on our parts. God damn it,

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I thought this call was from

**Tyram:** Brute. I'm trying to scheme. It's me,

**Justin Hale:** silence. Oh, your name is Oh, so hold on. So,

**Tyram:** Silus. Put your f****** hand down.

**Justin Hale:** okay. We

**Tyram:** Well, yeah. I mean, there's all those people who screwed over Ellmith. They like apparent they're going to

**Justin Hale:** also

**Tyram:** like gather in Greyport eventually. Maybe we f*** them over when we go there.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah, that would work. All right, we can

**Tyram:** Ellswith is too good of a person to do

**Justin Hale:** do

**Ali Leonard:** I think she's just

**Tyram:** shenanigans, but that's not a problem we

**Ali Leonard:** incapable of doing shenanigans.

**Tyram:** got. Also, she would suck at it. Yeah, that is

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, she probably had like a journal with like all the racers names and then like

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** question marks next to them like

**Tyram:** true. Racers. What the f*** is a

**Justin Hale:** You

**Ali Leonard:** racists and then like Scotty Mac is on there and then like crossed off because there's no

**Tyram:** racer?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Just a

**Justin Hale:** don't

**Ali Leonard:** way Scotty Mac was a part of

**Walden Briarhelm:** bit.

**Ali Leonard:** it. Well, she thought she

**Tyram:** That's That's kind of sad, but

**Ali Leonard:** had a friend.

**Justin Hale:** maybe

**Walden Briarhelm:** Somewhere Scotty Mack is like using his thumb to wipe away the teardrops from a picture of El Smith and him standing outside of the garage of one

**Tyram:** okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** of one of her first

**Justin Hale:** Careless whisper playing in

**Ali Leonard:** His daughter's like, "Why is Auntie Elsa coming

**Walden Briarhelm:** races.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Justin Hale:** the

**Tyram:** Always careless whisper. The only

**Ali Leonard:** back?" The only one that exists.

**Justin Hale:** background.

**Luke Neverisky:** It's all you

**Christopher Hooper:** Um so uh y'all

**Walden Briarhelm:** something. I don't know.

**Christopher Hooper:** um y'all get ready. uh you start packing up

**Tyram:** jazz

**Christopher Hooper:** the room fall um hitching up the Zoomfall. Um and

**Justin Hale:** Oops.

**Christopher Hooper:** um so to remind you, we haven't we haven't been back in a while, but the gold road uh gold road um is a road that heads up north. It lead eventually leading to Elderin. Uh before it does though, it branches off and that is um the route that heads to Greyport, but that happens after you pass through one of the the valleys that basically takes you through the mountains. So you actually pass the the um the village that was at the foothills before you went up to the Goliath's village. um that split off happens like basically just before you get to that mountain pass. Um and that's why that like crossroads um town was there because it's a kind of like a bottleneck place where everyone has to go through to to exit the region. Um so y'all pack up, you start heading there. Um you uh you make your stop at um Redbrook uh you see that it is thrived into a real little town. Um it's central uh nexus point between all the farms and the footlands and highforge and everything passing through. It's really developed as this as market marketplace. Um

**Tyram:** Now we just clarify we are bringing the Bugatti with us,

**Ali Leonard:** So, we have three

**Christopher Hooper:** you Oh yeah.

**Tyram:** right? Okay.

**Justin Hale:** The bank of

**Ali Leonard:** cars. Four cars. Did we take the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Oh

**Tyram:** Okay. We might have four. We could use the F-150.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. No, that stays at Great

**Tyram:** I want to take the

**Luke Neverisky:** How can

**Christopher Hooper:** or Y'all gave it to High

**Tyram:** F1. The f*** we

**Ali Leonard:** F-150? He did say they could use it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Forge. You did. You did.

**Walden Briarhelm:** We would never have done

**Luke Neverisky:** we? Ahead.

**Justin Hale:** Bugatti.

**Tyram:** did? Why would we hand away the marble of engineering that is the

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, you

**Tyram:** F-150? We're basically invincible with that on our

**Christopher Hooper:** would think, but that's that's what happened. That's in the

**Tyram:** side. You just don't want us to have it because you know that we'd beat any challenge you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Truly, we are not going to let this Oh.

**Tyram:** put in front of us with the power of an

**Luke Neverisky:** Clearly the superior vehicle.

**Christopher Hooper:** notes. Honestly, it's more uh logistically challenging to to bring this Bugatti everywhere.

**Ali Leonard:** So, are we

**Tyram:** F-150. All the more reason to finish our pocket village and have a

**Ali Leonard:** doing Cuz right now we had

**Tyram:** little garage for the

**Ali Leonard:** the roomfall attached to the

**Tyram:** Bugatti. All right, Brew

**Ali Leonard:** back like in

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** got it.

**Ali Leonard:** a you know like wheeling behind in like a

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah, we're the the broom the zoom

**Ali Leonard:** thing. Do we make a like a

**Tyram:** falls on a trailer and

**Ali Leonard:** two-tier trailer or is somebody driving a

**Tyram:** um somebody could

**Christopher Hooper:** It's a vehicle. It's a

**Tyram:** just we could have like a team driving those the broomfall and another team uh also hey actually we should bring that up. Do we want to keep calling this the doomfall? The sorry the broomfall now that we don't have doomfall in

**Ali Leonard:** Bugatti?

**Christopher Hooper:** beauty.

**Tyram:** the group

**Luke Neverisky:** You got to change your whole identity and things like that. I don't

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, how do you feel about it,

**Luke Neverisky:** know. I think it's

**Ali Leonard:** Liliana? You like it? You're not like drawn to your past

**Tyram:** anymore even though she's like your

**Ali Leonard:** life even and like your evil half

**Tyram:** evil

**Luke Neverisky:** great. Well, she's just she's just

**Ali Leonard:** yet.

**Tyram:** half.

**Luke Neverisky:** rough around the edges. It's I think it's great.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. I mean, technically my car is called Tim Cooper, but it's okay.

**Tyram:** Okay, let's have a we call it

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, cool. Uh, so y'all um uh so were you planning to take up the lead to go to the Goliath village or

**Ali Leonard:** I guess if it's on the way like if we have to pass by

**Tyram:** though. Yeah, I mean it's

**Christopher Hooper:** no?

**Tyram:** not too much of a diversion if it and it would really help

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean, y'all are

**Tyram:** to finish the uh the village

**Christopher Hooper:** very wealthy, so like food and

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** stuff is not a problem for you. Um, it'll take probably four 4 day diversion

**Ali Leonard:** Heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** to make it up back up to the mountain. In the meantime, you

**Tyram:** here.


### [01:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** can um you can pop into Milstrom uh briefly uh which you see it's done pretty well. Um, it seems like a lot of the people that uh work in Redbrook uh a lot of them live in Milstrom um and do like a three-hour commute on horse.

**Justin Hale:** Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah, you

**Tyram:** that they were staying the

**Justin Hale:** better pay.

**Christopher Hooper:** know, it's like that thing where you like you take your weekend

**Ali Leonard:** Damn.

**Christopher Hooper:** trip and you open up your stall and all that stuff. Um it's

**Tyram:** Bugatti.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** pretty because Melstrom has been there a while. There's like established um like mountaineering um resources like hides and stuff like that. Um a lot of manufacturing and stuff has already been established. Um, you you stopped there, you say hello. Anything you wanna you want to check out of Milstrom before you head up the mountain?

**Luke Neverisky:** What's the music scene

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, seems like uh not a lot of music, not a lot of artists come through there. if you're

**Luke Neverisky:** like? That's a shame. All

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, maybe on the way back we'll have like

**Christopher Hooper:** interested.

**Luke Neverisky:** right, let me think about that for a

**Ali Leonard:** a open mic

**Luke Neverisky:** second. What I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um you see they they they regularly have open mic nights. Really it's just like there's kind of a dusty dusty

**Justin Hale:** Night.

**Christopher Hooper:** um stage in the bar. um now that they're not

**Luke Neverisky:** saying

**Christopher Hooper:** they don't have like uh cultural revolutionaries um preaching from there and not a lot of

**Ali Leonard:** Hey,

**Christopher Hooper:** performances come through. It looks pretty dusty. Um but the the inn itself is pretty busy and gets a decent amount of traffic. Um they do mention to you

**Ali Leonard:** of course they

**Christopher Hooper:** that elder soldiers have come through and up to the mountain peak um to check it out. Uh they didn't know whether they were still there or

**Ali Leonard:** have

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Well, I understand we're on a mission here, but way back. Might be nice to liven up some music here.

**Christopher Hooper:** not.

**Tyram:** Oh, it's time to restart the machinery. It's time

**Ali Leonard:** Absolutely.

**Tyram:** to get these audiences hooked on the new superior talent of Liliana

**Justin Hale:** Carlber.

**Ali Leonard:** I think you're going to have to pivot

**Tyram:** Goldspring.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh jeez. I don't know.

**Ali Leonard:** your selling strategy there,

**Tyram:** I

**Luke Neverisky:** Maybe

**Ali Leonard:** Silus. It's a different vibe. It's a different

**Tyram:** mean, it's a different vibe to be sure,

**Ali Leonard:** crowd. I think it's a it's not as much of a hard cell as like

**Tyram:** but I mean, people go crazy for this like spiritual

**Ali Leonard:** a I think it's more like that's vibe.

**Tyram:** s***, you

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, you're

**Tyram:** know? Okay. Okay. You're right. I need to sell. This is a vibe that I'm selling, not

**Ali Leonard:** it's a vibe. It's not like

**Tyram:** like Yeah. Well, hey is is if

**Luke Neverisky:** As long as we're

**Ali Leonard:** a Yeah,

**Tyram:** there is a way to monetize this, I will find

**Luke Neverisky:** vibing.

**Ali Leonard:** absolutely. I believe in

**Christopher Hooper:** That's it.

**Tyram:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** I know you

**Tyram:** Oh. Oh, Brew, can you make me some like s***** little crystal things? I I don't care what they do. They just need to look like

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Tyram:** f****** like, you know, like funue or whatever. I'm going to sell people

**Luke Neverisky:** will.

**Tyram:** like meditation crystals to go with like the Liliana

**Ali Leonard:** Don't touch my

**Tyram:** vibe, you know. You don't have crystals.

**Ali Leonard:** crystals. No, she has vi she has a bunch of

**Tyram:** That's a different

**Justin Hale:** function.

**Ali Leonard:** like violesence

**Christopher Hooper:** She has at least one large

**Tyram:** character. Okay. Not by No. No. We want like

**Justin Hale:** Oh

**Ali Leonard:** crystals. I could see Bruce stealing my car crystal

**Tyram:** cheap We want like cheap useless things to sell to

**Luke Neverisky:** No, just normal.

**Ali Leonard:** and smashing it into a million pieces and saying, "Here, here's some crystals.

**Tyram:** people. No, I'm not going to sell people actual

**Christopher Hooper:** one.

**Tyram:** valuable things. Cuz the whole point is I'm telling them like useless crap that I'm pretending

**Ali Leonard:** That's why I was

**Tyram:** is

**Justin Hale:** no. I'll I'll uh I'll take a couple minutes and mess around and then hand you um three ball bearings, but they're all like they're all gussied up. They look like little

**Ali Leonard:** warning

**Justin Hale:** like you know powdery marbles that you know those like stupid little decorative balls you can get at like um Kirkland's or home decor

**Tyram:** valuable. Yeah. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** stores. It's that and they smell like poperri. They

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** Perfect. Okay. Um All

**Justin Hale:** smell like that store.

**Tyram:** right. I need to set up a stand here. Liliana, hit him with the vibe. Oh, whenever you're

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, right now.

**Ali Leonard:** three. So, is this a

**Tyram:** ready, I

**Ali Leonard:** cult? Because now we're kind of like

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. What?

**Ali Leonard:** come and then take our like give us your money for

**Justin Hale:** Huh? No,

**Ali Leonard:** nothing. Okay. I just

**Tyram:** guess. shades

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm just happy

**Justin Hale:** this is called a grift. It's not a gold. Two different

**Ali Leonard:** feel like I'm always in a cult. I just want to make

**Tyram:** of

**Luke Neverisky:** we're working

**Justin Hale:** things.

**Tyram:** distinction. There it there's subtle differences between the

**Ali Leonard:** sure. Would you tell me if I was in a cult? If you

**Tyram:** two. I would tell you if you were in a

**Luke Neverisky:** together. I

**Ali Leonard:** were the leader of the cult, would you tell me we were in a

**Tyram:** cult. No, I would lie

**Luke Neverisky:** mean,

**Ali Leonard:** cult? R. Would you tell me we were in a cult?

**Tyram:** to

**Ali Leonard:** Ah, dang it. We're

**Tyram:** you.

**Justin Hale:** If I knew we were in the cult, I would. This is the grift, though. The difference between the two is with

**Ali Leonard:** screwed.

**Justin Hale:** the griff you're just you're convincing people

**Ali Leonard:** Do a

**Justin Hale:** enough to buy things and then you leave before they figure out they suck. A

**Ali Leonard:** semantics question. Do cults grift? Do

**Justin Hale:** gold

**Ali Leonard:** cults grift? So, we could be

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Huh? Gold skin griff. Yes.

**Ali Leonard:** in both in a cult and grifting.

**Tyram:** Like I mean

**Luke Neverisky:** You know,

**Justin Hale:** Griff.

**Tyram:** honestly I'm not asking anyone to like stay with us

**Ali Leonard:** is a major part of the cult. You

**Tyram:** permanently which I feel like is a very distinct feature of a

**Ali Leonard:** kind of all want to hang together and not kind of like Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

**Tyram:** cult. Yeah. This is a this

**Justin Hale:** Uh,

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. Okay. Okay.

**Tyram:** is a fleeting transaction that we're going for rather than like a lifetime

**Luke Neverisky:** And and hey, you know, the good thing is the

**Ali Leonard:** Cool. That feels

**Luke Neverisky:** the best part is we're working together and having

**Justin Hale:** yes.

**Ali Leonard:** culty, right? That feels culty.

**Luke Neverisky:** fun.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's that's definitely what we're

**Tyram:** commitment. Should we get Liliana to start a cult? I feel like she'd be really

**Ali Leonard:** I'm on cult watch now and I don't

**Tyram:** good at

**Ali Leonard:** know. As long as you guys tell me I'm in the

**Tyram:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** cult, I'm fine with it. I just need to know that I'm in the

**Justin Hale:** doing. If we're in the

**Ali Leonard:** cult.

**Justin Hale:** cult, you're in it, too. But I don't I don't think we are.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. Well, if someone figures it out, let me

**Justin Hale:** I don't know. This This is the the pre the foreshadowing of

**Ali Leonard:** know. being a cold

**Justin Hale:** Liliana being like so much

**Luke Neverisky:** You thought was bad. Get

**Justin Hale:** worse. She's a fullon

**Tyram:** Helisana was the good side this whole

**Justin Hale:** like crazy cult leader. Was just upfront about her

**Luke Neverisky:** ready.

**Ali Leonard:** leader.

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. It's just

**Justin Hale:** corruptness.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so at some point you start playing at the

**Luke Neverisky:** vibes. It's vibes.

**Christopher Hooper:** the common mug, right? Cool. And you play more like a a folk style, is that

**Tyram:** time.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Ali Leonard:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Luke Neverisky:** that's right. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah. You see that?

**Luke Neverisky:** right. I need

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, as you

**Luke Neverisky:** a new

**Ali Leonard:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** um as you play your your music, um, you you notice that um, you see a um,

**Luke Neverisky:** playlist.

**Christopher Hooper:** well, go ahead and give me a performance check.

**Luke Neverisky:** So, I am crashing my screamy metal playlist and building something else. All right. Uh, performance

**Christopher Hooper:** 27.

**Luke Neverisky:** 27.


### [02:00:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So you see that uh very evidently that before um Helisana's music would would drive people into a mania um you your music um seems to clarify and calm people in a way that there was almost a you kind of step up to the mic you you start playing and the hubbhub of the the inn it is noticeably quieter. It's uh it's calmer. um you see some of the um more intense like arguments that were happening in the back uh just seem to settle down and um you see a few couples uh start to snuggle up and and watch you as you're playing and um you see a a very evident and obvious uh reflection of the comfort and uh calm that your your music is providing um uh to to the room. Um, and it's very it's very different and very jarring difference between before from the music that you played before and it seems to and you see it in the eyes most distinctly uh where people would have you even saw remnants of the old raver ravers in some folks and even the like the uh inebriating effects of alcohol that are obvious in people's eyes as they begin to drink. Even that seems to clarify in people's eyes and they they seem to see with a a greater clarity. Um

**Ali Leonard:** I'm not as worried about cults

**Luke Neverisky:** Wow. All

**Ali Leonard:** anymore. That

**Tyram:** I want

**Luke Neverisky:** right. Do you think they like

**Ali Leonard:** was that was the best thing I've ever

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah.

**Tyram:** to try to set up a little table and sell my uh my little

**Luke Neverisky:** it?

**Ali Leonard:** heard.

**Tyram:** crystal dealies like while they're all kind like you know vibing with the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, sure.

**Tyram:** the performance here.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah. About uh give me a persuasion check.

**Tyram:** Okay. Nope. Um, got to take my minimum on that, which is uh 17. Um, you want me to boost

**Christopher Hooper:** That's up to

**Tyram:** it? Uh, this is money's on the line. I'll boost

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Okay. How

**Tyram:** it. Okay, it is now a

**Christopher Hooper:** much are you trying to sell these

**Tyram:** 19. I'm trying to sell them. Um, I

**Christopher Hooper:** for?

**Tyram:** guess I'll try to start a little conservatively like uh maybe like

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And

**Tyram:** uh maybe like a silver a

**Justin Hale:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** what was your what was your total persuasion check? 19.

**Tyram:** piece.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** 19

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you see, it's interesting. So, the people that come in early, uh, you're able to talk into, uh, you end up creating a little bit of like a a betting war as, um, there's a couple dudes that, uh, come up to you and one says, "Wait, you're saying that these gather the power of the moon?" Like the new moon, you just put them on your window sill and they gather a power up.

**Tyram:** You'll feel much more in

**Ali Leonard:** Uhoh.

**Tyram:** touch with the moon when you have them.

**Christopher Hooper:** And another guy, hey, hey, really? I need to be in touch.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** My wife's been on my ass all day. Wait, how much are these a

**Tyram:** Oh, well, I'm just selling them for a silver a piece, my

**Christopher Hooper:** piece? Uh, will each one, if you get

**Tyram:** good

**Christopher Hooper:** multiple ones, will it make it even

**Tyram:** sir. Oh, for sure. Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** better?

**Tyram:** they uh the effect definitely compounds as long

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, how many

**Tyram:** as you believe it in your

**Christopher Hooper:** crystals do you think you

**Tyram:** heart. Uh Justin, how many did you make? Keep making them. This

**Justin Hale:** Um, I only made three, but I can keep making

**Christopher Hooper:** have?

**Tyram:** is This We need to have a

**Justin Hale:** them. Okay. I I can make three at

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, we'll say at the

**Tyram:** lot. All right. How long did we have to

**Justin Hale:** a time basically as it as we go.

**Christopher Hooper:** be we'll say at the beginning of this uh concert you have about

**Tyram:** make

**Justin Hale:** So,

**Christopher Hooper:** six. Um and it says, "Well, oh my gosh, in our house we need all six." Like, hey, no, I was here first. I want to buy at least one.

**Tyram:** them?

**Christopher Hooper:** Like, I'll I'll pay you an extra silver to get all six

**Ali Leonard:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** right now.

**Tyram:** Well, that is a mighty generous offer. Um, does someone else have an even more generous

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, like I I want at least one. I'll pay you six silver for one of them.

**Tyram:** offer? Okay. Yeah, I'll sell you this one for uh seven silver and you, sir, can have the rest for a

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, all right. Oh, man. I need these. Thank you, sir.

**Tyram:** gold.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh and and they pay you and you turn out more and uh three at a time, right? You know, turn out through the show show and people show interest, but uh eventually at some point in the show um you see that uh at some point people are like, "Wait, are these are just broken apart rocks?" Uh oh. Yeah, I don't I don't need these at all.

**Tyram:** Silus is furious. that Liliana is giving these people like clarity

**Ali Leonard:** I love it.

**Christopher Hooper:** And um yeah, and you you made that that big initial sell and then I think you sell maybe one other crystal for for a silver.

**Tyram:** somehow. All

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I'd join your call, I I'm your Can I be your first

**Tyram:** right.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Ali Leonard:** fan? Hell yeah. I'm making everybody

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I

**Ali Leonard:** friendship bracelets now.

**Tyram:** All right. Well, I think we made a total of uh 18 gold, so I'll uh sorry, 18 silver with the gold. Um so I'll I guess I'll split that with brew.

**Justin Hale:** Oh yeah. Add it to the

**Ali Leonard:** Get me a freaking tambourine. I'm going to be in that freaking van,

**Tyram:** Yeah, let's keep you in brown for a minute. This This

**Luke Neverisky:** mean,

**Justin Hale:** pile. Open the

**Ali Leonard:** man.

**Tyram:** is bad news, Brew. Somehow Somehow

**Justin Hale:** door. Toss it

**Tyram:** Liliana is making these people savvy. I don't care for that in the

**Justin Hale:** in. We don't like smart shoppers.

**Christopher Hooper:** You're going to have to roll down

**Tyram:** least.

**Christopher Hooper:** your

**Tyram:** No, I just need to scheme

**Luke Neverisky:** Ouch. He's a lot better.

**Christopher Hooper:** prices. Um, okay. So, um, you have a great performance, uh, Liliana and, um, yeah, El Smith,

**Tyram:** harder.

**Christopher Hooper:** are y'all, uh, y'all interested in doing anything before heading up the

**Ali Leonard:** before? No. But Liliana is going to teach me how to play the

**Ali Leonard:** hand.

**Tyram:** them. But the Eldorans do still suck

**Luke Neverisky:** right. So I

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. No, for sure. They suck

**Tyram:** though. So, how do we want to deal with these

**Ali Leonard:** harder.

**Tyram:** f******? Yeah. Okay, I guess. Yeah, we don't I guess we don't need to deal with them at all

**Luke Neverisky:** guess it's

**Ali Leonard:** We don't have to kill

**Luke Neverisky:** not

**Tyram:** really. But can we

**Luke Neverisky:** If we can't hug it out, then might as well just not

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** everyone. That's on you. As long as I'm kind of like,

**Tyram:** mess with

**Ali Leonard:** you know, you need me out of the way when before you mess with

**Luke Neverisky:** bite.

**Ali Leonard:** anyone just cuz I will mess up

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that's even

**Ali Leonard:** your plan. Not on purpose.

**Tyram:** them?

**Ali Leonard:** It's just kind of what I put

**Justin Hale:** Practice makes

**Ali Leonard:** out. You want me to practice messing with

**Tyram:** Yeah. I mean, this is a low

**Luke Neverisky:** brute.

**Justin Hale:** perfect.

**Tyram:** stake situation where you could try to get a little bit better or at least slightly less incompetent at messing with people.


### [02:10:00]

**Ali Leonard:** someone? As long as I don't have to speak to them and lie because I just can't do

**Tyram:** Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, no, no. We're not That is That is not

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Tyram:** your role in the messing with people uh messing with people uh arrangement ever. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. And at least

**Tyram:** But we've got a lot of really talented liars, so we we can handle that

**Ali Leonard:** we know that before we head into like a bad

**Tyram:** part. Yeah. You know, yeah. Like, know what you're good at. Know what your limitations are. You are not the liar in our in our

**Ali Leonard:** situation.

**Tyram:** schemes. All right. So, how should we mess with

**Ali Leonard:** So, they're kind of vibing in their tent

**Tyram:** them?

**Ali Leonard:** or like outside their tent or in a

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Why don't you go ahead and give me

**Ali Leonard:** fire. Okay, I'll look

**Christopher Hooper:** a perception check? Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** my I don't think it's great, but it's not bad. What do I add to you? probably

**Tyram:** I got

**Ali Leonard:** nothing. I got a

**Tyram:** a uh

**Ali Leonard:** 14, so I can only

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. All right.

**Tyram:** 23.

**Ali Leonard:** see see

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so Elizabeth,

**Ali Leonard:** stuff.

**Christopher Hooper:** um, you're looking at them. You're checking them out.

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, it looks like they are putting together some sort of um you kind of see they have this like tarp tent um that's emanating. They they mostly have their gear in there. They have this shack next to the tent and it looks like they're trying to build something. They're working on build building something in the shack. Um you see them go in and out. It looks like they kind of have this pile of junk right next to the tent. Um that you see

**Ali Leonard:** H

**Christopher Hooper:** them going back and forth and you see them like soldering things. And Silus, uh, you see around the tint there is, um, a little defraction in the air. It seems like something like arcane magical is like bubbling around the tent.

**Tyram:** Do they just have the reality stones on them right

**Ali Leonard:** I just see them soldering

**Tyram:** there? Well, hold on. Look, look this way. And I like try to like uh move Elsit's gaze to the the ripple

**Ali Leonard:** something and I squint even

**Tyram:** effect. You see what I'm talking about, right?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, Elizabeth, why don't you

**Luke Neverisky:** One of

**Ali Leonard:** harder. Okay, I do have a I do have

**Christopher Hooper:** give me an arcana

**Ali Leonard:** a plus on

**Christopher Hooper:** check? Yeah. Should be pretty

**Ali Leonard:** that. Oh, yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Luke Neverisky:** these

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, you recognize um you remember from the dragon attack what felt like years ago now. Um

**Ali Leonard:** 19.

**Christopher Hooper:** they have uh they're able to create um arcane shields um by diffusing the power from their crystals. And it looks like they've set a little like pylon within their tent um that creates a little like force field thing around the tent area. Um and it looks like that's what Silus uh was able to see. Um, it looks like with that check, we'll say they're definitely building something um uh almost like a like some sort of box like square uh cube structure type thing with two holes in it. And they're they're building and and working on it. And inside the box is glowing this like blue light from either end. There's two ends going straight through it. Almost like a wood planer. And you see them feed stuff into one side and it doesn't come out the other. It kind of goes straight through and then disappears. Uh they do that and then they they start working on the box again. And there there's a panel that's connected to the box and they're um working on that. Um, and you see that the box is connected to this relay, a huge like wall of different um you see these like m like metal bays that hold these um these pieces of rock and stone. and they are glistening with this like blue and silver light uh that's coming out of it. Um and it and it looks like there are these lines arcane lines that are connected to those into this cube.

**Tyram:** Don't love that. But

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I

**Tyram:** hey, you see how you should really just squint extra hard from the start,

**Ali Leonard:** really should start just squinting really hard. Maybe I need glasses.

**Tyram:** right? No, I just need to

**Luke Neverisky:** H.

**Ali Leonard:** It definitely helped for

**Tyram:** squint. That's what I'm

**Justin Hale:** The hard kill

**Ali Leonard:** sure. Whatever they're doing, I don't love

**Tyram:** saying. Okay. So, yeah, it

**Ali Leonard:** it. Is this like a cosmic

**Tyram:** seems like we should put a stop to this. Like anything they want to do is like

**Justin Hale:** is

**Tyram:** automatically bad, you

**Ali Leonard:** shredder or is it like a scan? I don't know. They're like putting something in something and it disappears. I don't love it.

**Tyram:** know. All right. So, messing with them might have to be upgraded

**Ali Leonard:** Maybe.

**Tyram:** to thwarting

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. And y'all uh head back down the

**Tyram:** them. Uh, no.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** mountain. No, I'm just kidding. What do

**Tyram:** What do we

**Christopher Hooper:** you want to do?

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, maybe we could maybe we should send a scouting group, get a little bit more information. Oh, I'll go because I'm Yeah, actually,

**Ali Leonard:** I just I'm

**Tyram:** you don't need to know

**Ali Leonard:** not I'll squint from over

**Tyram:** this. Yeah. Yeah. You're not the liar and you're not the the sneaker. Those are those are both

**Ali Leonard:** here. I'm just saying I know my

**Tyram:** nonsworth jobs. It

**Ali Leonard:** rule.

**Tyram:** that's good. That's a great thing. We should all We should all stay in our lane, you

**Ali Leonard:** I'll hug her back though. I'll definitely squint from this from over

**Luke Neverisky:** Jesus winter.

**Ali Leonard:** here. I know

**Tyram:** know. I'll I'll be at ease knowing that you're squinting. Um

**Ali Leonard:** it. I know

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, I I'll ask this question of you. You're talking about a scouting party. Um, so you have a pretty good view of what's going on. What, um,

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** like what are you trying to do with this scouting party

**Tyram:** actually I want to get close enough to listen them to them talk to each other to see if they'll like say anything that

**Christopher Hooper:** ting?

**Tyram:** is worth listening

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um, it

**Tyram:** to.

**Luke Neverisky:** Hey,

**Christopher Hooper:** you it's like their work is loud. Um, I don't even think you need to get very close. Uh, you're able to skitter between the huts and houses of the old village pretty easily to get into to hearing distance. Um, why don't you go ahead and give me a perception

**Tyram:** Okay. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** check? 17.

**Tyram:** 17 need a boost.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um I don't think so. Um so so you um you get pretty close the I think the group is able to stay like within reach but you kind of peak peek a little closer.

**Tyram:** Okay. I can just thank

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah and you hear um

**Tyram:** them if I need

**Christopher Hooper:** they are talking about uh you hear

**Tyram:** to.

**Christopher Hooper:** aspects about like uh stabilizing the the threshold. Um, and you hear some technical jargon about um needing to adjust a few of uh bays three and four's frequency to be able to maintain the threshold um to be able to stabilize it for its connection with uh with point alpha And you kind of hear this these types of terminology going I think you yourself it would be difficult to understand but I think the rest of you could all kind of like come to some conclusions

**Tyram:** Yeah, I was wondering if I could like relay all like the the terminology to the

**Christopher Hooper:** here. Mhm.

**Tyram:** nerds. See if it makes any sense to them. Does any

**Luke Neverisky:** Ala

**Tyram:** of this nerd talk make sense to you

**Ali Leonard:** Then I think real hard about it. Does


### [02:20:00]

**Tyram:** nerds?

**Ali Leonard:** it? Can I do a thinking

**Luke Neverisky:** spooky.

**Ali Leonard:** check? I don't get

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, do you want to use your real brain first and and we'll see if y'll come up with Is

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** there

**Tyram:** I assume they're probably trying to shut down the the portal that we used to go to the to the

**Ali Leonard:** Do they want to shut it down or do they want to

**Tyram:** tree zone, which is

**Ali Leonard:** get into

**Tyram:** also well, we don't want them to shut that down

**Ali Leonard:** it? your

**Tyram:** because that's like my portal to like go like see my girlfriend. So, yeah. That has to stay open. That

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh no.

**Tyram:** is the number one priority for

**Ali Leonard:** girlfriend.

**Christopher Hooper:** This feels a little different than that. Um because uh the portal that you went to um to the tree was in the cave and you're currently like within the huts of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** the village like you're outside the

**Tyram:** Silus.

**Christopher Hooper:** cave. And so they seem to be like reusing some of the mach existing like village machinery um that they've like collected out

**Tyram:** Okay. So, is this another portal like the like the demon

**Ali Leonard:** Oh,

**Tyram:** portals and stuff like that that we've seen popping up in different

**Ali Leonard:** Are they trying to do like a

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Ali Leonard:** spaceship?

**Tyram:** places?

**Christopher Hooper:** So go ahead, Elizabeth. Go ahead and give me that arana

**Ali Leonard:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Tyram:** Can

**Ali Leonard:** Nine. Oh, I think so. Didn't

**Tyram:** you flash a genius yourself

**Justin Hale:** Oh, can we double flash of

**Christopher Hooper:** Nine.

**Tyram:** now? I would assume they don't stack, but I don't know that for

**Justin Hale:** genius?

**Tyram:** sure. Usually when you get like the same ability used twice, you just take whichever one is better. You don't add them. But that's how like paladin uh

**Luke Neverisky:** Makes sense. Makes

**Ali Leonard:** I? That's a plus five,

**Tyram:** auras work for

**Ali Leonard:** right? No, wait.

**Tyram:** example. It's whatever your in mod

**Ali Leonard:** Plus

**Tyram:** is.

**Luke Neverisky:** sense.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, only one

**Ali Leonard:** four. That' be a 13 plus. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** 13. you're hearing some of this

**Justin Hale:** will

**Ali Leonard:** 13.

**Christopher Hooper:** terminology. You don't know a lot about Eldor and tech necessarily. Um, what it looks like to you is is they're trying to create some sort of you hear gate and you

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** think like like portal threshold. You hear threshold. You hear and you see that stuff is going into the box into

**Ali Leonard:** That's what I was confused

**Christopher Hooper:** the light and and basically disappearing.

**Ali Leonard:** about cuz it was going it was disappearing like it was either being teleported or like destroyed. So like maybe it's being they're teleporting stuff to Aldora.

**Christopher Hooper:** Exactly. So, they're talking about relay A, uh, point A. So, it seems like it could be teleporting to another location.

**Ali Leonard:** H I tell you guys my suspicions that I think it's teleporting to another location possibly Aldora.

**Tyram:** Oh man, you don't think they're trying to mine the reality stones

**Ali Leonard:** Absolutely they

**Tyram:** themselves, do

**Justin Hale:** If Helga was talking about him, that would make sense. Wasn't she working with

**Ali Leonard:** would. They weren't against each other,

**Tyram:** Um,

**Ali Leonard:** but

**Tyram:** may maybe I mean they didn't seem to wart her from ruling over or anything. So, at the very least, they had some sort of uh

**Justin Hale:** them?

**Tyram:** parlay with each other. I don't know.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, anyone who wants to can give me a

**Tyram:** I guess we can ask them if we were like

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. History check.

**Christopher Hooper:** history

**Tyram:** we can kick these guys ass and interrogate them

**Ali Leonard:** History

**Justin Hale:** I'm okay at

**Ali Leonard:** check. Oh, now it's a 20. Okay. Not

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Ali Leonard:** twice.

**Christopher Hooper:** that uh 20

**Tyram:** maybe.

**Justin Hale:** this.

**Christopher Hooper:** history. I think that there there was a movement from Elderan against Helga's High Forge, but you

**Tyram:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** thored it uh when uh because Lady Corwin was going to

**Ali Leonard:** Right. We were like,

**Christopher Hooper:** hire Eldoran mercenaries to take the city.

**Ali Leonard:** "f*** that." Right. It's just a lot of memory checks because I don't remember. Got it. Hey, so they're not working with each other. We should stop them from doing whatever they're doing cuz this tech will make you sacrifice some of your friends and send them to

**Luke Neverisky:** That's not

**Justin Hale:** That's not

**Ali Leonard:** space.

**Justin Hale:** great. I don't

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I would rather it not happen a second

**Luke Neverisky:** great. Yeah, that that

**Justin Hale:** love that.

**Ali Leonard:** time. Yeah. So, and I

**Luke Neverisky:** is not vibes.

**Ali Leonard:** have to learn that too. So, I will make a list of what is vibes and what is not

**Tyram:** Oh god, there's going to be a whole

**Luke Neverisky:** I know you did

**Ali Leonard:** vibes. It's going to be the gospel. I'm making

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey,

**Tyram:** thing with you, isn't

**Ali Leonard:** a

**Tyram:** it?

**Luke Neverisky:** great. Elus

**Ali Leonard:** cult.

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Tyram:** I'm still mad about

**Luke Neverisky:** will be my

**Tyram:** you have making me work so much harder to fool people at your

**Luke Neverisky:** profit. Just because I know you're so talented, you'll do great.

**Ali Leonard:** She wants to be at your full

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Tyram:** concerts. I have to ascend to a higher level of

**Ali Leonard:** potential.

**Tyram:** scamming.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. So, they keep working. Um, y'all keep scheming.

**Ali Leonard:** Hey guys, we should probably stop him

**Christopher Hooper:** Any any thoughts on

**Ali Leonard:** from

**Christopher Hooper:** action?

**Tyram:** Yeah. I feel like just like as a rule of thumb,

**Ali Leonard:** this. We get them to stop

**Tyram:** if the Eldorans want to do something, we don't want them to do

**Ali Leonard:** doing that thing because I feel like they're probably going to be getting a lot of information we don't want them to

**Tyram:** something.

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Ali Leonard:** have.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** But we also don't want him to tell

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Eldorans that we were doing this, that we were that we did

**Tyram:** Oh, so are we

**Ali Leonard:** it. I mean, maybe not killing, but

**Tyram:** coming all the way back around to killing them

**Ali Leonard:** like knocking them out and taking their

**Tyram:** then? Oh, well, I do like taking

**Ali Leonard:** stuff. You know what I mean?

**Tyram:** their

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** Like, no. Stop it.

**Tyram:** stuff.

**Ali Leonard:** Bad. Grounded.

**Luke Neverisky:** I think they're not going to just, you

**Ali Leonard:** No, I don't think

**Luke Neverisky:** know, yeah, they're not going to take to ask asking

**Ali Leonard:** that's not I don't even think that's option this

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool. All right. I'm gonna I'm going to do a a dagger heart thing. And if y'all leave me an opportunity, I'm going to do

**Luke Neverisky:** nicely.

**Ali Leonard:** time. Uhoh. I'll give them an

**Christopher Hooper:** something.

**Luke Neverisky:** Neato.

**Tyram:** Okay, here's

**Justin Hale:** It's a wrong game, sir.

**Ali Leonard:** opportunity.

**Tyram:** a here's a plan. What if I go in try to like just gum up their machinery? You know, they're like, "Oh no, it it's broken." And and then then when they come out

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** We jump them. Yeah. And make

**Tyram:** to try to fix it, we jump

**Ali Leonard:** sure it's really

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I like for the attack being a

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm

**Tyram:** them.

**Justin Hale:** here. Take Kevin with

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin.

**Tyram:** Okay. Now, remind me, is Kevin going to be an asset in my my

**Walden Briarhelm:** secret.

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Ali Leonard:** broken. Pass.

**Tyram:** scheme?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, he can be he can be a decoy at the very

**Christopher Hooper:** I like

**Tyram:** Okay, that's true.

**Ali Leonard:** Yes, he

**Tyram:** I give Kevin a little pat on the head. That's right, gun big

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, I like

**Tyram:** guy. Shut up.

**Luke Neverisky:** hugs,

**Justin Hale:** least.

**Christopher Hooper:** hugs.

**Tyram:** Anyway, all

**Ali Leonard:** does.

**Tyram:** right. So, I'm gonna try to stealth my way over to their machinery and then I'm if there's any like um now since this is like

**Luke Neverisky:** too.

**Tyram:** ostensibly like a steampunky setting, there's obviously just a bunch of like exposed machinery and like moving gears for me to like try to

**Christopher Hooper:** Give me

**Tyram:** plug up here, right? That that is the that is the aesthetic,

**Christopher Hooper:** a uh give me a cell

**Tyram:** right? All right. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** check 29. Um something that uh we are beyond steampunk. Yeah,

**Tyram:** 29. Damn

**Ali Leonard:** You're so

**Christopher Hooper:** that was 200 years ago. We are

**Tyram:** it. I just remember all the steampunky guns

**Christopher Hooper:** too.

**Tyram:** from like Ellit's image a few weeks ago. I was hoping that some things just like I was hoping they just kept the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, we are too uh sleek


### [02:30:00]

**Tyram:** aesthetic.

**Christopher Hooper:** like no exposed. Uh, not not

**Tyram:** Damn it.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** as much. It's a I think I once described it as

**Tyram:** Okay. Like diesel

**Christopher Hooper:** um it's the it's the aesthetic of Star

**Luke Neverisky:** That sounds

**Christopher Hooper:** Wars really, which is like I think I looked it up and it's like uh disco punk is what it's

**Tyram:** punk.

**Ali Leonard:** Disco

**Christopher Hooper:** called. Um which is basically

**Luke Neverisky:** nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** like 70s sci-fi tech.

**Tyram:** Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um uh but uh with that uh you are

**Ali Leonard:** bug.

**Christopher Hooper:** able to get um you see they they kind of work on routines. Um where one seems

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** to be hauling more as the other is working on the machine, turning dials and working on the terminal. Um, you're able to sneak on the other side of this machine that they're working on and you get a really close look and you feel this like energy and heat being like contained within this cube. The cube is large. It is the size of an oven. Um, uh, a full like yeah stove oven piece. And it basically the entrance um that they're putting things through is the size of an oven door. Um you're able to you see more exposure coming out of the back, but there is this they're basically using the back as this exhaust where all the energy is exhausted from. Um and as you get close, you feel it's almost scalding to you to you as you get closer. You see the figure on just the other side of this uh cube is wearing protective gear um as they like work uh on the

**Tyram:** Okay. Can I also see what materials they're feeding into

**Christopher Hooper:** machine. Yeah.

**Tyram:** it? Like what are they uh what are they transporting

**Christopher Hooper:** Weirdly, they seem to be moving boulders. They seem to be tearing down uh a lot of the shacks in the village and moving

**Tyram:** here?

**Christopher Hooper:** like long beams that they can like slowly feed like pieces of lumber into the machine long ways.

**Ali Leonard:** I thought it would be like it's

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, kind of like a mixture of those two

**Ali Leonard:** weird. Is our radio

**Christopher Hooper:** things.

**Tyram:** I got psychic phone going. So yeah, I'll I'll relay this information to you

**Ali Leonard:** on? This is going to sound more

**Tyram:** guys.

**Ali Leonard:** good. Can we push them in the oven?

**Tyram:** We don't know if

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, that is more

**Justin Hale:** I have

**Tyram:** that would uh be okay for

**Ali Leonard:** I'm just

**Tyram:** organic things to go through here. There's a lot we don't know. You wearing protective

**Ali Leonard:** saying it would probably break

**Tyram:** gear, so it's maybe not great to go through this

**Justin Hale:** nothing.

**Tyram:** thing. Do uh you

**Ali Leonard:** it. I

**Tyram:** got your psychic push thing, right?

**Ali Leonard:** do talking. I shove. I could shove them.

**Tyram:** That'd be a pretty effective way to do

**Ali Leonard:** Is that

**Tyram:** it. All

**Ali Leonard:** crazy or is it

**Tyram:** right. I think it's a

**Luke Neverisky:** So Elizabeth went

**Ali Leonard:** gross? Like I do

**Tyram:** wonderful

**Luke Neverisky:** from Frank's like to

**Ali Leonard:** no pranks or I kill

**Tyram:** idea. There is no in

**Luke Neverisky:** 11.

**Ali Leonard:** someone. Pranks are not

**Tyram:** between. Um, well, hey, actually, that's great because that's also a way for us to uh not get

**Ali Leonard:** true. Our fingerprints aren't on it. Well, mine is, but you know what I

**Tyram:** uh get IDed by these guys

**Ali Leonard:** mean.

**Tyram:** either. Yeah, even if he survived, he wouldn't be able to

**Ali Leonard:** who shoved him. Okay.

**Tyram:** like identify us as the ones who did anything to

**Ali Leonard:** Well, I'll just have to wait until they're like up against it and then I'll shove

**Tyram:** him. Okay, so you guys go ahead and get in position.

**Ali Leonard:** it. I see how far away

**Tyram:** Um, I want to see if I got anything that I can uh help

**Ali Leonard:** I have to be. Um, but then 30 ft. Can I hide and still be 30 ft away?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I think the bigger issue is the

**Tyram:** with.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** terminal. So, it's a cube, right? So, he's working perpendicular to the entrance of the

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. So, like the door like that's the door and they're here like on this side.

**Christopher Hooper:** cube. Mhm. That's right.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. Okay. Can someone throw a rock in front of

**Tyram:** Well, if we need to get you closer, we might be able to If we need to get you closer, we can maybe like stuff you in the in the in the

**Ali Leonard:** it? I'm not going in that thing until it's

**Tyram:** pee

**Luke Neverisky:** Wait. Oh,

**Tyram:** hole. It was cleaned. Brew Brew told me he cleaned it, so I'm assuming it's

**Luke Neverisky:** wait. Wait.

**Ali Leonard:** cleaned. If Brew cleaned it, it's not

**Justin Hale:** I cleaned it. I

**Ali Leonard:** clean. Brew, look me in the eyes. Did you clean

**Tyram:** clean.

**Justin Hale:** totally cleaned it. You can fur, but I

**Ali Leonard:** it?

**Tyram:** See, I mean, I don't love that he says he can't prove I didn't, but um what the

**Luke Neverisky:** friends. I can just make you invisible. Would that

**Tyram:** hell? What the hell are we doing here? Yeah, go ahead,

**Ali Leonard:** So, we'll need someone to Well, we need

**Tyram:** Lilian.

**Luke Neverisky:** help? All

**Ali Leonard:** to get the get one of the guards in front of the door, in front of

**Tyram:** I

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** the

**Tyram:** love the I love it whenever like people are coming up with like some cockami scheme but then like some

**Ali Leonard:** oven. I can

**Christopher Hooper:** What

**Tyram:** spellcaster is like I have the ideal spell for this

**Ali Leonard:** do this perfectly if you want.

**Christopher Hooper:** about

**Tyram:** situation.

**Luke Neverisky:** Have you thought about

**Ali Leonard:** Can someone like distract them or like plant something in front of the oven or like throw a rock or something to get them in front of the oven?

**Tyram:** Yeah. Oh, I can take care of that.

**Luke Neverisky:** magic?

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. And then Bruce, clean the

**Christopher Hooper:** magic?

**Tyram:** Is there

**Justin Hale:** You have

**Ali Leonard:** pea

**Tyram:** like you said there's an exhaust to this thing. Are there like smoke stacks like

**Justin Hale:** Kevin. It's clean. It's totally

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Tyram:** uh on top of it or

**Justin Hale:** clean.

**Ali Leonard:** bag.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, what I meant by that is like um it's like it's like a like a grate that's like emanating heat out the back of it.

**Tyram:** anything? At the back of it. Okay. Okay. Okay. I

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** was trying to think if I could like drop like a like a rock inside of like a smoke stack or something. Um Um Yeah, I can probably find a way to sab it. I I can at least make a distraction even if I

**Ali Leonard:** I want to shove somebody in it, but they need to be in

**Tyram:** can't break the

**Ali Leonard:** front of the machine and I keep them perpendicular or

**Tyram:** machine. All right, just let me know when you're ready and I'll try to make that distraction for

**Ali Leonard:** whatever. Okay. How long does invisibility

**Tyram:** you. an

**Ali Leonard:** last? Okay. Make me

**Luke Neverisky:** last for one hour. They give you a little

**Tyram:** hour. Um, it it'll wear off

**Luke Neverisky:** poop on the nose.

**Ali Leonard:** visible. I'm still gonna

**Tyram:** immediately if you do damage to someone or if you force somebody to make a saving throw. So, I

**Ali Leonard:** hide behind something for

**Tyram:** think Yeah. So, I think that your uh

**Ali Leonard:** sure. So I I h

**Tyram:** your your push will break the

**Ali Leonard:** I go about 30 feet away at the

**Tyram:** invisibility.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Ali Leonard:** most and try and

**Tyram:** The other guy is just like going back and forth,

**Ali Leonard:** hide. Think

**Tyram:** right? The one who's not like feeding stuff

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes, he's like

**Tyram:** into the

**Christopher Hooper:** going he's basically the one doing a lot of the physical labor of

**Ali Leonard:** so.

**Christopher Hooper:** like adjusting the one at the terminal is like calling out these like instructions to adjust the relay which is this like huge wall where like there's these

**Tyram:** machine.

**Christopher Hooper:** cavities that hold like these like illuminating stones in them, rock. And then he when he kind of goes does that for a while and then he moves to like start feeding material into the

**Tyram:** Okay. So, um, he's the one we need to push in, right? Because he's the one who's feeding stuff

**Ali Leonard:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** cube.

**Tyram:** in. Okay. Um, hey Kevin, do you have any

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm

**Tyram:** of any bruised bombs on

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin.

**Tyram:** you? And even a nod or a headshake from you there,

**Ali Leonard:** and also says

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Hey.

**Tyram:** Kevin. Of course. Of course. All right. All right. I want you to can I like roll something to see if I

**Justin Hale:** Yes.

**Tyram:** can like identify like a really effective place to throw a

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Tyram:** bomb at on this

**Christopher Hooper:** mean, the exhaust seems like a good

**Tyram:** machine. Okay. Okay. Um All right, Kevin, when I give you the

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Tyram:** signal, I want you to uh throw a bomb at that

**Christopher Hooper:** place. I'm

**Tyram:** exhaust. All right. So yeah, we'll do our

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin.

**Tyram:** distraction right as you're ready to push that guy into the uh into the threshold. Oh, but just in case that doesn't work, uh Ma, maybe you should like be on standby to like just go up and like physically push him if you need

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. On

**Tyram:** to. Use your like mad physical ability to just like run up and push him if you have

**Walden Briarhelm:** standby.

**Tyram:** to. All right, just let me know when you guys are ready.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Understood.

**Ali Leonard:** I'm ready.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm Kevin.

**Walden Briarhelm:** has positioned himself to be

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, I'm going to have uh Kevin throw a bomb at the exhaust and I'd like to simultaneously uh go up to the guy at the console and I want to

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.


### [02:40:00]

**Tyram:** pants

**Ali Leonard:** Damn.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. We'll start with a

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Absolutely freaking vicious, man.

**Christopher Hooper:** pancing.

**Tyram:** him slide of hand obviously,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, uh, you can, but I don't think you can fail. You can, um, roll it just to see how high you go.

**Tyram:** right? Okay. uh

**Christopher Hooper:** I thought I thought so.

**Tyram:** 27.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah, your

**Tyram:** Yeah, I'm very good at uh at pancing

**Christopher Hooper:** pancing of

**Tyram:** people. Read into that what you will, I

**Christopher Hooper:** him, your pancing of him. Um, it takes him a while to notice, but the uh the gale winds of the the mountain peak um begin to

**Tyram:** guess.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, damn.

**Christopher Hooper:** shrivel up his testicles and he quickly

**Tyram:** Good.

**Christopher Hooper:** realizes, "Oh, I've got no pants

**Tyram:** Good. Uh, after I pants him, I want to

**Christopher Hooper:** on." Okay. Um, at

**Tyram:** teleport away so that he doesn't find me next to

**Christopher Hooper:** this point his labor friend is feeding in a uh large um beam of

**Ali Leonard:** And

**Christopher Hooper:** aluminum and he

**Tyram:** him.

**Ali Leonard:** then so he's

**Christopher Hooper:** is very close to the

**Ali Leonard:** feeding it, but is he in front of it? Perfect. Then

**Christopher Hooper:** cube.

**Ali Leonard:** I shove him into the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** cube mentally.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, cool. But yeah, give me that uh athletic uh give me an athletic check or an

**Tyram:** I think her psychic push thing she has

**Ali Leonard:** You have to make a shrink

**Tyram:** the victim has to make a strength

**Ali Leonard:** save cuz it's it's a

**Christopher Hooper:** arcana. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** spell. It's a mental

**Christopher Hooper:** Is this spell? It's

**Tyram:** save. It's technically not a spell, but it is

**Christopher Hooper:** a spell.

**Tyram:** a it's a magical ability,

**Ali Leonard:** push. The DC

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. What's it DC?

**Tyram:** I guess. It's from my

**Ali Leonard:** is 8 plus my int. What is it? 8 plus my

**Tyram:** feet. Eight plus proficiency plus your intelligence

**Ali Leonard:** intelligence 8

**Tyram:** modifier. It should

**Ali Leonard:** 14. I think

**Tyram:** be Wait, your DC is only 14? It should be the same as your spell

**Ali Leonard:** so. I'm

**Tyram:** DC. There's no possible way it's only

**Ali Leonard:** going back. I'm going back. I'm going back. It

**Tyram:** 14. Um what's your

**Ali Leonard:** says, oh, 16.

**Tyram:** modifier? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Your your proficiency is plus4. Your end is

**Ali Leonard:** Sorry. Yeah, I saw proficiency is

**Tyram:** you said it was plus4. Yeah. That makes it

**Ali Leonard:** plus two and that's on me. That's my

**Christopher Hooper:** So, there was one moment

**Tyram:** 16.

**Christopher Hooper:** where it seems like it might not be enough, but

**Ali Leonard:** bad. I think

**Christopher Hooper:** then it just seems like it's enough and you push him

**Ali Leonard:** harder.

**Christopher Hooper:** in and at that point Kevin

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** He

**Christopher Hooper:** yells

**Tyram:** Wait, I'm stronger

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin and he throws a dynam dynamite at the

**Luke Neverisky:** squinted.

**Christopher Hooper:** exhaust and it the machine eventually uh like not eventually but uh gets hit by this dynamite stick and about uh

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** a 3/4 of the way this body is through this cube. Uh the bottom half gets severed and falls limp and cat caterized to the to the snow below. It explodes. The man at the terminal uh trips over his pants and it machine explodes in his face. Um, and uh he's quickly trying to crawl away into some shelter um as uh the explosions happen on the on the machine there. It It's

**Ali Leonard:** Excellent.

**Christopher Hooper:** weird in that you you see an explosion happen and it almost reverses and then happens again over and over again. Um where like goes in and out with this explosion over and over again causing the effect on the outside but seems to be repeating on itself. Um, and the the the the guy is uh crawling towards one of the shelters. He he uh he gets into the shelter. He pulls up his pants. Uh he be you kind of hear him uh he seems to be talking on a radio. Hey, we got an issue here. The whole thing's coming down. Um and uh he um you hear you lose track of him in the shed at this point. Um the uh machine is just like exploding over and over

**Ali Leonard:** That's probably not

**Christopher Hooper:** again.

**Tyram:** I guess we should probably leave.

**Justin Hale:** Yes, time to

**Ali Leonard:** good. So, is that a prank that I

**Walden Briarhelm:** on

**Ali Leonard:** did?

**Tyram:** Hell yeah, Elizabeth. It went exactly as you

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. I think

**Ali Leonard:** It seems it seems pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** you you nailed

**Tyram:** planned. Extremely

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. You think you think so

**Justin Hale:** go.

**Walden Briarhelm:** now? I would listen to Silus. He seems to have the

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Ali Leonard:** extreme. I feel like we kind of just killed a guy and then

**Walden Briarhelm:** right mindset about it. No,

**Ali Leonard:** broke

**Tyram:** effective. Well, I mean, he could be alive. He doesn't need his legs,

**Walden Briarhelm:** no, don't overthink

**Justin Hale:** Did you see him

**Ali Leonard:** reality.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Justin Hale:** die? Did you see him

**Ali Leonard:** I guess not.

**Tyram:** right? He doesn't need his

**Luke Neverisky:** Did you confirm the

**Justin Hale:** die? If you didn't see him

**Tyram:** legs. He's

**Justin Hale:** die, you don't know he's

**Tyram:** fine. So, we maimed the man. We didn't necessarily kill him,

**Justin Hale:** dead.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. It doesn't make me super

**Tyram:** man. At the end of the day, these are Elderon f****.

**Luke Neverisky:** kill?

**Ali Leonard:** confident. You know what? Fair.

**Tyram:** Who cares?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Just drink cold lotion. It'll be fine.

**Ali Leonard:** True.

**Tyram:** Okay, so we're uh running away. Um wait, I guess we still need to Where are the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, the

**Tyram:** reality stones? Like where were we supposed to be looking for

**Christopher Hooper:** notes you saw, they were in the cave.

**Tyram:** those? Okay, let's let's head to the

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool.

**Ali Leonard:** looking at the machine. Did that probably have a reality stone in

**Tyram:** cave.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Ali Leonard:** it?

**Christopher Hooper:** um you did see a whole wall of stones that were bunch of in in some like loading bays and then some that were getting loaded in the machine. Um they look kind of interesting.

**Tyram:** Are they still around enough for us to grab

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, they are close to this like repeating explosive machine, but you you could probably sneak in and get

**Tyram:** them? Okay, you're up. Well, the guy who moves the fastest and is the strongest is, I think, a good choice for this

**Luke Neverisky:** Makes

**Christopher Hooper:** some

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, here we

**Tyram:** task. And he's willing to do it. That's a big

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I don't know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** go.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, I How How are you approaching this? I

**Luke Neverisky:** sense.

**Christopher Hooper:** almost want you to tell me what check you want to run right

**Tyram:** plus.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. I would almost leave it up to a group vote. I I truly am just

**Tyram:** Um, well, the real question is what are you good at? And then we'll try to

**Walden Briarhelm:** in it for the

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Tyram:** think of a way to justify it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** fun. I'm I'm strong

**Tyram:** So, you're probably good at athletics. Athletics, honestly,

**Walden Briarhelm:** and I can Yeah, athletics

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** most

**Tyram:** is probably like the the most obvious name to roll here

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. I'm

**Tyram:** anyway, right? Like, he's trying to move fast and lift something. Those are those are athletic

**Luke Neverisky:** going to hold this.

**Christopher Hooper:** appropriate.

**Tyram:** jokes.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. I I want you to make two checks. I want you to make an athletics check and a slight of hand. And if either of them are below 20, I'm going to have you make some saving throws.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm. Oh, that's great. I'm going to do slide of hand first so that maybe bad things start at

**Ali Leonard:** Are these stones small enough for me to mage hand

**Walden Briarhelm:** 20. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um, the ones you see are pretty

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** also? Okay. Well, I just thought I'd

**Christopher Hooper:** large. I don't know

**Tyram:** What does Mage hand cap out at? Like

**Christopher Hooper:** what

**Tyram:** five

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh

**Ali Leonard:** check 10

**Tyram:** pounds. Oh, I was only giving it half as much credit

**Walden Briarhelm:** I think I can

**Ali Leonard:** pounds. How

**Tyram:** as it

**Walden Briarhelm:** full with 25 strings. I think I can full sprint with like 375 pounds in my hand. So we're

**Tyram:** deserved. Oh, f***. That's right. You have that Giants belt. Like, you're even

**Walden Briarhelm:** good. Uh, so I got a 21 on slide of hand.

**Tyram:** stronger than I thought you were.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Yeah. I

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't need

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. And I rolled a 26 on

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. you

**Walden Briarhelm:** athletics. 26 and

**Ali Leonard:** dare

**Christopher Hooper:** um I think he you seem it is it is a dance of like pure athleticism, speed, and

**Walden Briarhelm:** 21.


### [02:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** strength as you like like zoom into this like huge array with mounted stones and like one after another you're able to just yank out a stone, toss it, toss Toss, yank, toss, yank, toss. As you work through the whole array, you sling them out. Um, and then you move through, you see um this cart that has these stones um waiting to be loaded into the machine. And you then slide um uh I think either shell or knee slide under the machine's uh perpetual explosion into this cart and then slide it into your team. And then uh you collect what looks to be um close to 500 pounds of these

**Ali Leonard:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** stones.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Not not even a sweet.

**Tyram:** s***. I love it when our bad

**Christopher Hooper:** What a

**Tyram:** plans yield like really great

**Walden Briarhelm:** Not only did I ever

**Ali Leonard:** yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** think this was a bad plan, it may have been a bad prank, but it was

**Ali Leonard:** I'm learning so much from you

**Christopher Hooper:** prank.

**Tyram:** results. Well, hey, the stupid plan

**Walden Briarhelm:** not a bad

**Tyram:** works. It wasn't a stupid plan, right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** plan.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, it's at this point you see

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh the guy in the tent come out and he

**Ali Leonard:** guys. Oh, right. They

**Christopher Hooper:** just blasts off into the air and starts

**Ali Leonard:** have jetacks.

**Christopher Hooper:** like blasting off into the uh horizon. Um, yeah. And you've uh you've collected um about 500 lb of this stone. Um, now you can you can carry down the mountain.

**Ali Leonard:** PE bag. Pa

**Justin Hale:** Don't let

**Ali Leonard:** bag. Sorry. Pee hole. Pee

**Tyram:** the pee hole. Thank you very

**Christopher Hooper:** Um I think uh what

**Ali Leonard:** hole.

**Christopher Hooper:** the portable hole caps out at What?

**Tyram:** much. Um, I think it's a matter of space more so than weight. Um, here I'll double check, but I think it holds like

**Ali Leonard:** this a little

**Tyram:** uh let's see. Uh, like it's 10 ft wide when

**Walden Briarhelm:** It will be

**Tyram:** it's all the way unfurled.

**Walden Briarhelm:** 500.

**Tyram:** Um, okay. So,

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** bit.

**Tyram:** um, this fine black cloth soft as silk is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 10 sorry 6 feet in diameter. You make a magic action to unfold the portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface where upon the portable hole creates an extra dimensional hole 10 ft deep. So it's a 6 ft diameter 10 ft deep cylinder. Basically uh the cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence. So it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature uh inside the open

**Ali Leonard:** and

**Tyram:** portal hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

**Ali Leonard:** smelling

**Tyram:** Um, it does not list any sort of weight limit as far as I can

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** tell. It's just it's a matter of space, not a matter

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Um, can y'all recall what is already in the

**Tyram:** of weight. A bunch of journals, I know for sure. And probably some

**Ali Leonard:** like just a little bit.

**Christopher Hooper:** hole?

**Tyram:** of Bruce's

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, he he

**Ali Leonard:** Hopefully he

**Tyram:** piss. He did clean it. He We We can't prove that

**Walden Briarhelm:** cleaned it. He He said

**Ali Leonard:** didn't clean it. He had Kevin clean it and Kevin can't clean

**Tyram:** he did it. Well, you know what? Maybe you shouldn't be so f******

**Walden Briarhelm:** so. He peed in it. He did not s***.

**Justin Hale:** Whoa. Whoa. Hey, I'm

**Ali Leonard:** s***. I've had to babysit Kevin. I know

**Tyram:** ableist with Kevin. Thank you very

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Ali Leonard:** what he can

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. He can't clean s***, but he can clean things.

**Justin Hale:** Kevin, I'm so sorry that it's all right, Kevin. You don't have to cry about it. It's

**Ali Leonard:** do. I love you. I

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Tyram:** much. Well,

**Justin Hale:** okay. The bad lady won't hurt

**Ali Leonard:** love you,

**Tyram:** I hope you're proud of yourself, Ellsworth. You've made

**Ali Leonard:** Kevin. Well, if you teach him how to get up

**Tyram:** Kevin cry.

**Ali Leonard:** after himself, we'd not all be

**Christopher Hooper:** god. Okay. If the

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** journals and the reality stone are the only thing in the hole, then that should be fine.

**Tyram:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, cool. Okay. Um, all right. Y'all

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh y'all head down the mountain and uh you load up and you make your way across to Greyport. Um, I'm curious,

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, how many of our characters have been to Greyport

**Walden Briarhelm:** easy.

**Tyram:** Um, Silus and Brew and Ellit very explicitly have

**Ali Leonard:** me and Olivia has been.

**Tyram:** been. Yeah, Olivia was there for Ellit's

**Christopher Hooper:** before?

**Tyram:** uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** has never traveled this far north.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yeah. All right. And,

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, Liliana has not maybe

**Tyram:** race.

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't think so. I mean, no. But I'm wondering if Helisana in if she was she popular enough to perform there in that case, then she would have at least passenger seated there. Or if Helisana hadn't

**Tyram:** I feel like Elsa

**Luke Neverisky:** reached that yet, then no, she Yeah, I would

**Tyram:** was pretty much in her fledgling days of her career or

**Luke Neverisky:** know.

**Tyram:** the campaign, right? You were

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So then Nope. Yeah. on

**Tyram:** still playing at like, you know, like like bars, right? Instead of like

**Luke Neverisky:** there. That's true. I was

**Christopher Hooper:** All right, then.

**Tyram:** console.

**Luke Neverisky:** underground kind of. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I'd like I'd like uh folks to all come up with something that uh you would see as you enter the city that's noteworthy. Um, we'll start with Taylor.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, not to interrupt. Do you have a a brief description of

**Tyram:** Oh, sorry. Yeah, Graport was like the main city from the last campaign. Um so I guess most of us probably

**Walden Briarhelm:** Greport? Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, as the prompt, you can start

**Tyram:** are uh thinking

**Walden Briarhelm:** okay.

**Ali Leonard:** Where are

**Christopher Hooper:** with like the the main visage if you

**Tyram:** about okay well um what

**Christopher Hooper:** want.

**Tyram:** had existed before at least um Greyport is located on the east side of the continent. Um it's called Greyport because it's kind of got like a London atmosphere where it's pretty much like overcast and gray skies pretty much all the damn time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** Um um there is a river that runs through it. Um it does have like uh you know uh like medieval style walls surrounding the town, but um it's kind of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** outgrown those in a lot of ways. It does have like big like skyscrapers like reaching up. Um it uh probably the tallest tower in the old campaign, maybe that's changed, was like the governor's residence. It was kind of like the the the seat of power for the uh for the town. Um, I'm going to say that maybe the first thing that we see as we approach town is that um in the archway over the uh main entrance to the city, they have erected statues of a uh a water janasi, a dwarf with a prosthetic arm, a war forge with a uh with a uh daft punk mask, um two gnomes, One of which looks to be a forest gnome. The other one appears to be a stone

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Tyram:** gnome. Um, uh, a cowboy human.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, and Chad

**Tyram:** And I think that's everyone, right? No, not Chad. Chad Brad didn't make the cut. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, I said

**Tyram:** well, not Chad, Brad, but

**Christopher Hooper:** Brett.

**Tyram:** um, would uh, Princess Val have been included as part of

**Christopher Hooper:** Feel like she has

**Tyram:** the group, I guess, is a question I'll ask

**Luke Neverisky:** that. Oh, she was pretty good. She's pretty big.

**Christopher Hooper:** her own statue somewhere else in the

**Tyram:** you. She probably does have her own statue somewhere else, but she was

**Christopher Hooper:** city.

**Tyram:** probably like the most important NPC in the last campaign. So, I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Up to

**Tyram:** know. You know what? No, it's just the Steve squad. Oh, and of course,

**Ali Leonard:** And of course, Steve, you almost left off

**Christopher Hooper:** you.

**Tyram:** Steve. Um yeah, there there's a

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh gee, how do we forget

**Tyram:** wolf in the middle clearly in like a central leadership

**Christopher Hooper:** I was thinking like the other people

**Tyram:** position amongst the uh the different members of

**Ali Leonard:** Steve.

**Christopher Hooper:** are like the backdrop to Steve like in a very majestic

**Tyram:** the

**Luke Neverisky:** speed? Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Dire

**Christopher Hooper:** pose.

**Tyram:** Steve is like disproportionately large.

**Ali Leonard:** wolf.

**Tyram:** Like he had sunglasses.

**Luke Neverisky:** He has sunglasses, right? Okay. Okay, that's all

**Tyram:** Yeah, Steve had drip. I mean honestly

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Justin Hale:** Indian

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** like

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah, man. Steve. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** May I ask another question for settings? Is the uh

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** are the Eldorians present in

**Justin Hale:** trip.

**Tyram:** I think Greyport is like the the main city of like that uh Free

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** Republic, right? That like um extends over like the collection of

**Christopher Hooper:** That's right.

**Tyram:** islands out in the sea here. Yeah. So yeah, I think this is like one of the last few places that's like standing in resistance to the Eldorian Empire if I remember

**Walden Briarhelm:** Graport? Perfect. Perfect. That's what I needed.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um Um All right. And Justin, what

**Walden Briarhelm:** Thank you.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh what else do you see as you like enter Greyport? What are some of the first things you see?

**Tyram:** correctly.

**Justin Hale:** How how far away was

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Justin Hale:** um Fluke's shop from like the main drag of

**Christopher Hooper:** think pretty

**Tyram:** If we're coming in from the west, like the the landward side,

**Christopher Hooper:** far opposite side.

**Tyram:** Flukes was all the way on the other side of the

**Justin Hale:** Greyport? Oh, okay. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** the

**Justin Hale:** What about uh what about the park that Dane hung out

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, that was pretty central, I

**Tyram:** city. Yeah, I think

**Justin Hale:** in? Okay, I'm gonna

**Christopher Hooper:** believe.

**Tyram:** so.

**Justin Hale:** say that's become more uh more industrious. So, like before it was like a little like podunk like

**Ali Leonard:** zoo.

**Justin Hale:** farm zoo and now it's like a big legit zoo um like San Diego zoo style thing where it's like that little park area has like bought out the areas around it to make more of the zoo and there's like sanctuaries for like species that have never been here before and

**Tyram:** Hell

**Justin Hale:** uh that kind of

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Tyram:** yeah. Got to build that owl bear petting zoo after

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Justin Hale:** thing.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. So, they see So, as you come in, you kind of

**Tyram:** all.

**Christopher Hooper:** see off to the side there's a huge entrance and there's like a long line to enter the zoo. There's like just

**Ali Leonard:** too many.

**Christopher Hooper:** so many strollers. There's so many strollers and

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** like a bunch of tired moms with crying babies and toddlers in their strollers. Um, huge line out the

**Justin Hale:** Yes.


### [03:00:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** zoo. Um, and inside you can hear the like of uh

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** various monkeys and animals and growls. Um, all right. Uh, Ally, what do you got? Uh, as you make your way past the zoo, deeper into the city, what do you

**Ali Leonard:** Um, I think I see cuz my eyes are in the road, but there's a big construction kind

**Christopher Hooper:** see?

**Ali Leonard:** of coming up and it's for the future home of the Kenny G Museum, Lenny T Museum.

**Tyram:** Who the f*** is

**Ali Leonard:** There's

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Kenny G? What

**Christopher Hooper:** um the Linu Museum

**Ali Leonard:** a

**Christopher Hooper:** uh getting constructed. Um uh we'll say we're on like a

**Tyram:** the

**Christopher Hooper:** boulevard where kind of the the main sites are getting are are being set up. Uh, as you work your way, you see um it it's basically an

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** old opera house that they that was pretty dilapidated and they are uh recently got uh revitalized after a big donation and is now being rebuilt as the uh the Lin uh

**Ali Leonard:** a memorial.

**Christopher Hooper:** museum and um performance space and

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, hell yeah. And performance venue. He's

**Christopher Hooper:** memorial. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** like ghost of It's like Phantom of the Opera ghost and Lenny T is just

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** there.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh yeah. Um and Luke,

**Tyram:** Oops.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh let's see. As you work your way down the boulevard and then move, uh deeper into the city, what do you

**Luke Neverisky:** question. I don't remember about Caspian's um epilogue there, but did she start like a winter king church or

**Ali Leonard:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** see?

**Luke Neverisky:** anything like

**Ali Leonard:** left to my assistant and she was She did become the governor, but she was in

**Tyram:** She eventually became the governor. Remember

**Ali Leonard:** charge of like the refugee

**Tyram:** Yeah, I think that community

**Luke Neverisky:** that?

**Ali Leonard:** center. And then because I did

**Tyram:** center like really expanded

**Ali Leonard:** my winter king stuff outside of Greatport, even though I think Great is

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** probably the central hub of people who follow the Winter

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Okay.

**Tyram:** afterwards.

**Luke Neverisky:** obviously

**Walden Briarhelm:** And as we pass the campus, I'm very pleased to first see what looks like a group of people all gathered in this in a common area. And then to smell the aroma of some caramelizing mozzarella in the air. And it's at this point I grow very thankful to find out there's at least one pizza place

**Ali Leonard:** That's definitely a stoner Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** in this town being a place I've never been. It was uh it was a deep concern of mine having grown so fond of pizza recently to go without would be torture. So, one of the things that notices is that there is
