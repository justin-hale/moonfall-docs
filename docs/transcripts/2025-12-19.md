**Christopher Hooper:** My bless.

**Luke Neverisky:** Hey, what's going on? What's that?

**Justin Hale:** What's up? Chilling. Chilling. I need to add these to the shelf. But where will they go? There's good for now. I put together my

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, hell

**Justin Hale:** IKEA shelves. and got all my games on

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah. That is a full shelf, my guy. Oh, yeah. That is two. You

**Justin Hale:** them. It's two shelves

**Luke Neverisky:** are getting your money's worth in a dollar per square inch on your

**Justin Hale:** full.

**Luke Neverisky:** shell.

**Justin Hale:** Absolutely. Yeah. It's

**Luke Neverisky:** And I know

**Justin Hale:** amazing that they all fit on there, too. So

**Luke Neverisky:** board games aren't light either. So that uh that's Swedish

**Justin Hale:** good. No, they're

**Luke Neverisky:** engineering

**Justin Hale:** not. The honestly, the IKEA bookshelves are like

**Luke Neverisky:** like

**Justin Hale:** the best bang for your

**Luke Neverisky:** damn I wish I lived there in India because that would be pretty

**Justin Hale:** buck. They are perpetually out of

**Luke Neverisky:** great. I guess that makes sense.

**Justin Hale:** stock. That's the only thing that sucks. Um, Christina basically has a notification for that color that anytime they go in, they come in stock because we're not near like an IKEA uh store. Um, so I guess that's the thing. If you're near an IKEA store, they're much more in stock because the stores get priority over shipping. Um, but they're like

**Luke Neverisky:** Got it.

**Justin Hale:** chronically out of stock

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, I guess that makes sense. They're so popular in that

**Justin Hale:** online. Yeah. But

**Luke Neverisky:** regard.

**Justin Hale:** yeah, so nice to have them all on display. See the the bottom is

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** uh Frost Haven, Gloom Haven, Gloom Haven. That one is Topheer's copy that I that I accidentally stole. And then that's my copy. And then Frost

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. Dog.

**Justin Hale:** Haven, where the where the dog butt is,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Oh.

**Justin Hale:** um has never been opened. Yeah, it is still still factory sealed because

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** uh haven't haven't had a chance to play it yet. Yeah, that um was that the one? No, I had to pack that one. Maybe not. Oh, it was uh Dice Throne. I

**Luke Neverisky:** man.

**Justin Hale:** ordered Dice Throne X-Men on their Kickstarter and it took them over a year to uh to finish. So, I kickstarted it in Nashville and I had to tell them to change my address for the shipping because it took them that long to finally push the game

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh man, good thing that actually worked

**Justin Hale:** out.

**Luke Neverisky:** out. I know sometimes that can be all sorts of lucky with changing addresses and like you sure you got are you sure you got it? Are you

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** sure?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I uh I actually got it sent to my in-laws house because I didn't know if

**Luke Neverisky:** That's Yeah, totally

**Justin Hale:** we have the keys for this house

**Luke Neverisky:** smart. Yep, that makes

**Justin Hale:** yet. Yeah. The uh the office the old office is coming

**Luke Neverisky:** sense.

**Justin Hale:** together. Got my my racing rig set

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice. Does that make you

**Justin Hale:** up. Oh, my charger fell

**Luke Neverisky:** like code faster or something? Does that make you type

**Justin Hale:** out. Do

**Luke Neverisky:** code

**Justin Hale:** what? That would be amazing. Just like scroll

**Luke Neverisky:** faster?

**Justin Hale:** through with wheel

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, actually. Yeah. You can do it like an old uh like an old iPod or something where the you rotate clockwise and it scrolls to the right until it finds

**Justin Hale:** turns. Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** a new line. You could be doing that forever in a in a solution, but it would be fun.

**Christopher Hooper:** I um I'm

**Justin Hale:** That was that'll be

**Christopher Hooper:** testing out some earbuds tonight that I just got. So, we'll see

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, you sound you sound

**Christopher Hooper:** how it goes.

**Luke Neverisky:** like you. That's a a step in the right

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Now I'm wondering, could you just hear my brother-in-law

**Justin Hale:** fun.

**Luke Neverisky:** direction. I heard I heard like a a word, but not like a

**Christopher Hooper:** talking?

**Luke Neverisky:** sound, but

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Do you hear a fussy

**Justin Hale:** No,

**Christopher Hooper:** baby? All right. Oh, me? Oh, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** nope. Just unless that's you,

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, great. Uh yeah, Matthew, I got the the Buds uh two and it has transparency which is the important part. So I could hear you even though I have them on and

**Justin Hale:** but


### [00:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** I can hear the people on my call and maybe they can't hear the baby that's fussing on me right now.

**Luke Neverisky:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** Can you hear that? Can you hear the fuzzy baking? That's amazing. Okay, great. Um, cool. We will continue to test this. How's my uh voice quality coming

**Luke Neverisky:** story. Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** in?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool. All right, more experiments to

**Luke Neverisky:** Perfect.

**Christopher Hooper:** come. I agree about IKEA bookshelves. We have like several We have like matching billies on either side of the the bookcase or on the fireplace. And yeah, like to get something equivalent is so much more expensive than the IKEA

**Justin Hale:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** ones. But yeah, like I've only seen

**Justin Hale:** dude. That's crazy. quality is

**Christopher Hooper:** them available once and we got the two that we

**Justin Hale:** so

**Christopher Hooper:** needed.

**Justin Hale:** yeah they were only doing uh two two Billy bookshelves per

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh wow. Oh wow.

**Justin Hale:** order. So we had to make two accounts in our different

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh my god. Really? That's

**Justin Hale:** names in order for us to get four of them.

**Christopher Hooper:** crazy. Did you get them delivered or are they Is

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** there

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, because I was not going

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** to drive two hours to uh I don't think

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Justin Hale:** it was even Cleveland. I think it was Columbus for the nearest

**Christopher Hooper:** mean, so you're closer to an IKEA

**Justin Hale:** like distribution center or

**Tyram:** Disgusting.

**Christopher Hooper:** than I am because my closest one is

**Justin Hale:** something.

**Christopher Hooper:** Memphis, which

**Justin Hale:** Probably. Um it wasn't an actual IKEA either. It was like

**Tyram:** Columbus.

**Christopher Hooper:** is Oh, a pickup

**Justin Hale:** uh just like a place routinely drop off to or something.

**Christopher Hooper:** spot. Oh, okay. Okay. There there is one of those

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** in Nashville, but it's like if I'm going to do that, I might as well just get it delivered.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. Um, there's an IKEA in

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** How Okay, not too bad.

**Justin Hale:** Columbus.

**Tyram:** Awesome.

**Christopher Hooper:** How close is that? Oh, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Interesting. About two

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, there is a closer IKEA to you than than me.

**Justin Hale:** hours.

**Christopher Hooper:** Amazing.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hello,

**Tyram:** Hey guys. So, I actually had a few questions about uh tonight. Are we like Brew's family or just like I saw there was like an operative Brew

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor.

**Tyram:** who I assume is you know

**Christopher Hooper:** Um well uh

**Justin Hale:** We're all related.

**Christopher Hooper:** I was going to spend the first part um having you all define um how you're all associated with one another. I love the idea that you're all like

**Tyram:** Brew

**Christopher Hooper:** uh maybe related like kind of like a mafia like your cousins and second cousins and uncles and sisters and whatever. Um, but y'all could y'all can uh you know throw out

**Tyram:** I think it would be funniest like apparently the objective is to like uh cause mischief to awaken the the island turtle that we're like living on,

**Christopher Hooper:** ideas. Yes. Mhm.

**Tyram:** right? I like I kind of think it would be funny if we were just like a Rotary club or you know just like something like that would be like a very loose association in our society but it's like a

**Christopher Hooper:** like the

**Tyram:** sacred covenant amongst

**Christopher Hooper:** Freemasons or

**Tyram:** goblins. Yeah. But it's just like we're like uh like a bowling club or something like

**Christopher Hooper:** something.

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. A

**Tyram:** I guess we can talk about that once Ally

**Christopher Hooper:** Rotary Club. What? What exactly is a Rotary

**Tyram:** arrives.

**Christopher Hooper:** Club? Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** I It's something I know old people do. Um

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Well, I imagine Justin will join any day now,

**Christopher Hooper:** Same. You'll join a Rotary Rotary Club any day as being the oldest one in our group?

**Justin Hale:** What am I? Oh, I was

**Tyram:** but No, you're not. But you

**Christopher Hooper:** No.

**Justin Hale:** like, "Oh, that's so

**Tyram:** like No, personalitywise, I think

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I think you're

**Justin Hale:** depressing." Oh, fair. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. No, that's that's

**Tyram:** you're like the most likely to do an old person thing like

**Christopher Hooper:** younger than I am, aren't you? By like four

**Justin Hale:** totally Oh, yes. Duh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You old ass.

**Tyram:** that. Okay. Rotary Club is a local chapter of Rotary International, a global service organization, a business and professional leaders who

**Christopher Hooper:** days.

**Tyram:** volunteer to serve their communities and the world by promoting peace,

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Tyram:** fighting disease, providing clean water, supporting education, and growing local economies. Okay, so it does sound more like

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, so it is like a Freemason.

**Tyram:** like a Knights of Columbus or like a uh like a Freemason type of thing than

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. I thought

**Tyram:** I thought it was.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I I like you thought Rotary was some like cribage

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** game or

**Justin Hale:** I thought it just had to do with the old ass

**Tyram:** something like that. I thought it was just like some sort

**Christopher Hooper:** something.

**Tyram:** of like like local community center type thing. I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So, uh I would like y'all to tell me at any point if you hear like

**Justin Hale:** telephones.

**Christopher Hooper:** or other people like any sort of unwanted

**Tyram:** know.

**Christopher Hooper:** noise from me. Um,

**Tyram:** I actually couldn't hear what you said because you cut out

**Justin Hale:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** right when you said if you hear any and then I didn't

**Christopher Hooper:** this I I think that just might be

**Justin Hale:** same. That was kind of

**Tyram:** hear

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** because I'm leaving my Wi-Fi and heading into

**Luke Neverisky:** that makes

**Christopher Hooper:** cellular. Um,

**Tyram:** anything. That must be it.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay, good to know. But yeah, if I if you hear any

**Justin Hale:** ironic.

**Tyram:** Hey

**Luke Neverisky:** sense. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** background noise or anything, let me know. Hi Ally. Oh, I want

**Justin Hale:** She making cookies. Did you make enough

**Christopher Hooper:** a

**Justin Hale:** for the class? Did

**Tyram:** Hell

**Justin Hale:** you bring enough for the class? Oh, you're muted and you're far

**Tyram:** yeah. I was about to say even if she did, that's like just a waste of cookies

**Justin Hale:** away.

**Tyram:** because, you know, couldn't it possibly get it in front of us?

**Christopher Hooper:** cookie. Except Ally, open the

**Tyram:** Well, she could conceivably drive them to

**Christopher Hooper:** front door.

**Tyram:** either Luke or to Toeer and I Nashville, but not both because like I feel like she's actually probably about equidistant between us

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, Ellis is in Nashville, so she should definitely make the Nashville

**Tyram:** roughly. That is a good point.

**Christopher Hooper:** trip.

**Justin Hale:** My god, why did I pay so much for this thing? Fresh

**Tyram:** What is

**Justin Hale:** to hell. It's an old Nintendo

**Tyram:** that?

**Justin Hale:** 2DS. It's one of the old ones. One of the

**Tyram:** That's a 2DS. Oh,

**Justin Hale:** what they call the doors stop

**Tyram:** okay. Okay. Yeah. I didn't remember them having such like kind

**Justin Hale:** ones.

**Tyram:** of like a Fisher Price looking like case to

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. The new 2DS's

**Tyram:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, so everyone

**Justin Hale:** are

**Christopher Hooper:** uh I know Justin like said, "Hey, try out this game and we can play together." Don't do it. You will lose countless hours of your life. It

**Justin Hale:** clamshell. It's so good. It's such a good

**Christopher Hooper:** is. It's got kind of like a Pokemon feel to it. Like a fast-paced

**Justin Hale:** game. Little

**Christopher Hooper:** Pokemon

**Justin Hale:** bit. I can see that. Yeah. Uh, it's it's

**Tyram:** It looks like it's card collection of some

**Justin Hale:** um auto battler deck

**Christopher Hooper:** feel. Yeah. But it's very fast.

**Justin Hale:** builderish.

**Christopher Hooper:** Like each game is like 10 minutes or

**Tyram:** sort.

**Christopher Hooper:** so if you're thinking

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. I'm very surprised at the inapp purchases not being crazy

**Tyram:** Well, that's

**Justin Hale:** exploitive. Yeah. Like you can buy

**Tyram:** a change of pace for how it normally goes these

**Justin Hale:** new characters or uh new captains, but you don't have to. Like I I think I only bought one and that's because um I had the coin the gems or whatever from being in the beta for

**Tyram:** days.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Interesting.

**Justin Hale:** it. So like I I haven't actually spent any of my own money

**Christopher Hooper:** I kind of wonder if

**Tyram:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** like at some point all the best captains

**Justin Hale:** yet.

**Christopher Hooper:** are like

**Justin Hale:** Maybe. I mean, in this season, I'm at level 21 and I haven't run into any captains that um I've seen that are paid

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** paywald. Well, you paid and

**Justin Hale:** for. I don't think a lot of people buy them,

**Christopher Hooper:** you're level 21 and I haven't paid and I'm level four. So, seems kind of

**Justin Hale:** honestly. I think I play a whole lot more than

**Christopher Hooper:** sus. Seems kind of

**Justin Hale:** you. I honestly I don't know if I think it would be sad if I was able to see the amount of hours that I've played that

**Christopher Hooper:** suspicious.

**Justin Hale:** game. I've put

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I get so annoyed when

**Justin Hale:** far too many hours in that

**Christopher Hooper:** like someone some bot is playing

**Justin Hale:** game.

**Christopher Hooper:** me round two and they already have like a gold card and I'm like, "Oh, it's going to be this is going to be an uphill

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, there's some where it's like turn three, they already have cards in the

**Christopher Hooper:** battle." Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** like attack and health of the 30s with golds and I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** like, you do


### [00:20:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** b*******. I also stupidly just realized today that when you gold, you get treasure for

**Justin Hale:** that. Mhm. holding cards is is sometimes more advantageous than anything else. Midas, if you haven't played with Midas yet, his actually that captain becomes

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Yeah. Well, I thought it was stupid because

**Justin Hale:** pretty pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm like I like barely ever gold cards. Like why is this useful? I'm like, "Oh, oh, I

**Justin Hale:** goated. Oh, that's why.

**Christopher Hooper:** see." Yeah. So, it's pretty fun. Don't get it. It'll

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** waste a lot of your

**Justin Hale:** It is. It is deceptively time wasty. It's so fun to play though. Like I play it all the time when I'm like waiting in a doctor's office or, you know, waiting to pick up Olly in the school line or whatever.

**Christopher Hooper:** life. Yeah. I

**Justin Hale:** It's so

**Christopher Hooper:** was uh I think it was a couple nights ago. I was waiting for Jasmine getting ready for bed and I'm like, "All right, I'll play a couple games." And I'm like, "Holy s***, it's

**Justin Hale:** good. Mhm. I've I've 100% done that where like Christina's falling asleep and she'll wake up and she's like, "Dude, it's one o'clock in the morning. Go to sleep." I'm like, "No, it's not. No, it's not. Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** midnight. I need a timer for

**Justin Hale:** god." Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** this.

**Justin Hale:** Seriously, I needed something off the shelf. What did I

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, these are my first headphones with transparency mode, and it's so cool. It's like really

**Justin Hale:** need?

**Christopher Hooper:** high quality. It's very

**Justin Hale:** Is that freaking you

**Christopher Hooper:** odd, but I, you know, I like it a lot.

**Tyram:** What does it mean for headphones to be

**Christopher Hooper:** It's It's like you can hear around you as if you did not have earbuds in, but you still get

**Justin Hale:** out?

**Christopher Hooper:** like high quality audio through your

**Justin Hale:** Yep. So it dual purposes the mic. So like your um so AirPods

**Tyram:** transparent?

**Luke Neverisky:** Perfect.

**Justin Hale:** for instance that have the mic on them, it's actively taking the noise in the

**Christopher Hooper:** earbuds.

**Justin Hale:** microphones and pushing it into your ears uh but then filtering it as well. So if noises get too loud, it like lowers the volume in your ears, but you still hear it. Like you still hear everything that's going on. I actually wore my AirPods in transparency mode to the system of a down

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. You and Joseph did

**Justin Hale:** concert for that reason.

**Christopher Hooper:** that, right?

**Justin Hale:** Uh, Joseph had

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. I had loops, too. Yeah. Which were pretty

**Justin Hale:** loopies or

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Tyram:** Fancy. So, hey, um Martha's not going to be here for an hour

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Tyram:** and uh Zach ain't coming. So, I think everybody's

**Christopher Hooper:** right, cool. Um, this

**Tyram:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** should give everyone time, if you haven't already, to look at that

**Justin Hale:** loops.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh that web page I sent you

**Tyram:** Would you

**Christopher Hooper:** all. Uh,

**Tyram:** recommend us having the a tab with that open for

**Christopher Hooper:** you don't really need to. Um if it was just a setting

**Tyram:** tonight?

**Christopher Hooper:** the setting the the context and the mood and um and also to give y'all uh uh your

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** What's

**Christopher Hooper:** first uh prompt of the evening is uh what type of organization is this? Like uh who are each of you? Um yeah, how do you know each other?

**Luke Neverisky:** that?

**Tyram:** Okay. So, Al, um I was talking to them earlier. My vote would be

**Ali Leonard:** not as

**Tyram:** for something frivolous, but which we take super

**Ali Leonard:** part. So, we're not all bruised

**Tyram:** seriously, like we're an ultimate team or something. Well, we could all be Bruce Cousins, but we could also be like an ultimate frisbee team or both, you

**Ali Leonard:** cousins. Yeah. Like a bowling league or

**Tyram:** know. Yeah, I actually did say bowling. I also said a Rotary Club, but apparently I did not understand what a

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. Yeah. And then we looked up what a

**Justin Hale:** So

**Ali Leonard:** like

**Tyram:** Rotary Club actually is.

**Christopher Hooper:** Rotary Club

**Justin Hale:** we we could duel this. We could double it

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Justin Hale:** though and be a bowling club called Brews Cousins. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Justin Hale:** that's just our name.

**Ali Leonard:** Are we not actually related to

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Ali Leonard:** maybe some maybe you are related to Brew and then maybe you're not cuz like people bring their

**Justin Hale:** a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like that that whole

**Ali Leonard:** people bring their friends into

**Tyram:** So, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** like friends

**Ali Leonard:** groups the Brew's cousins and then eventually they all left and none

**Tyram:** started off with just the Hey.

**Christopher Hooper:** was.

**Justin Hale:** thing. Yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** of us are actually related to

**Tyram:** Uh, hey uh Justin, how do goblin names

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Brew.

**Tyram:** work? Is Brew his given name or his

**Justin Hale:** My cannon was that um

**Tyram:** surname?

**Justin Hale:** the names are basically just like

**Ali Leonard:** There's like 20 bruise in my kindergarten

**Justin Hale:** sounds. Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** look. Well, your your full name is Felonius Brute,

**Justin Hale:** exactly. Yeah. So, so Brew picked his first name and then

**Ali Leonard:** class. True.

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Justin Hale:** like the second name is just like whatever your parents like whatever the sounds that your parents

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** associate with is

**Ali Leonard:** Your first

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** So your first time

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I guess.

**Tyram:** was

**Ali Leonard:** sound. Good

**Tyram:** okay. Be weird if it was

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Brew was Brew was

**Tyram:** felonious.

**Justin Hale:** really fancy when he first came out and then he descended into full-on Chaos

**Ali Leonard:** morning.

**Tyram:** Oh, that was the other thing I was going to ask. So, which do which do we want to say? That most goblins act like Brew or that

**Christopher Hooper:** This

**Tyram:** Brew is like an

**Christopher Hooper:** is up to y'all. Y'all can shape goblin society right here, right

**Ali Leonard:** pretty

**Luke Neverisky:** Um,

**Justin Hale:** Goblin.

**Tyram:** outlier. It would be fun as

**Christopher Hooper:** now.

**Tyram:** players just to kind of intro like like you know indulge in our like you know destructive goblin foolishness. But also, I think it would be very funny if like most goblins were like super urbane and witty and brushes running around all like, "Oh, blow s*** up, you

**Luke Neverisky:** That's true. Both are kind of

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I think uh I there is a part of me that was like brew is actually the like

**Luke Neverisky:** fun. Oh, like Brew is actually

**Christopher Hooper:** reasonable

**Luke Neverisky:** tame compared to others. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** one. Yeah. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Brew.

**Tyram:** know.

**Justin Hale:** Brew escaped because he was too too high brow and intellectual

**Ali Leonard:** Too

**Luke Neverisky:** funny.

**Justin Hale:** for Amaz. That's so

**Ali Leonard:** nerdy. Get

**Justin Hale:** good. That's so

**Tyram:** Too much of a stuffed shirt. Couldn't handle all the hooligans and go to

**Justin Hale:** good. So, so goblins are basically like just the the backwoods abilities of this

**Ali Leonard:** out. Chaos goblins.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. That's an

**Justin Hale:** world. That's

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, we created the name Chaos

**Christopher Hooper:** option. That's an option.

**Justin Hale:** fantastic. That is a that is an

**Ali Leonard:** Goblins and we owned

**Tyram:** say

**Justin Hale:** option.

**Ali Leonard:** it. Except

**Christopher Hooper:** So, so far we've got ideas of a bowling club uh called Bruise Cousins. Uh not related. Um Goblin Society, you want to stick with that with uh Goblin Society being uh Brew is the tame version of goblins and

**Tyram:** I do worry if we're too committed to being like too rambunctious that it'll be very difficult for us to actually accomplish anything

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Christopher Hooper:** I will uh I you you don't need to worry about that. Thing things will

**Luke Neverisky:** right. I wonder

**Christopher Hooper:** happen when they need to

**Justin Hale:** I don't like

**Tyram:** tonight.

**Luke Neverisky:** is Brute if R is the tame one in G

**Justin Hale:** the way that

**Luke Neverisky:** society then is he embarrassed by

**Christopher Hooper:** happen.

**Justin Hale:** sounds. Could

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. Well over his head. Like

**Luke Neverisky:** us? They're like no no I

**Justin Hale:** be

**Ali Leonard:** anytime we're like, "Let's go to Goblin Country." And he's like, "Actually, let's

**Luke Neverisky:** can't go back there. No. They're f******

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe you are related, but he

**Ali Leonard:** not."

**Luke Neverisky:** crazy.

**Christopher Hooper:** hates admitting

**Justin Hale:** Um, it could be that like Brew just like outgrew the goblin society like intellectually like he wanted to build bigger things. So, not necessarily that

**Ali Leonard:** And we're

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Justin Hale:** he Yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** stuck on fireworks and

**Justin Hale:** You're fine with the technology that you have. So, not

**Ali Leonard:** like blowing up toilets.

**Justin Hale:** not that he's necessarily embarrassed by it, but it's just like it's not for

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** him. Yeah. You know, like moving to the big city from your

**Ali Leonard:** He grew

**Christopher Hooper:** my

**Justin Hale:** from your small

**Tyram:** had to get out there, see the world. You

**Justin Hale:** town.

**Ali Leonard:** it. And I feel like the goblins would be fine with that. They'd be like, "Yeah, cause chaos

**Tyram:** know, I feel like that's a good amount of nuance

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. Could be the whole like homecoming

**Ali Leonard:** out

**Tyram:** for Bruce. I kind of like that

**Christopher Hooper:** god.

**Justin Hale:** thing. If Brew ever comes back, they're like, "Hey, how's life in the big

**Christopher Hooper:** And I

**Justin Hale:** city?" Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** there." And

**Tyram:** approach. Do we have to have Russian

**Ali Leonard:** we throw firecrackers at you.

**Tyram:** accents?

**Christopher Hooper:** definitely um I I think uh you let your heart guide you on that. You let you you follow the accent that you believe is fitting for your character. I think

**Tyram:** If we were going to be Bruce's

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Tyram:** family, I was going to take the tact of being uh Brew's like

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** Hell

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, that's

**Tyram:** conspiracy-minded

**Ali Leonard:** good.

**Tyram:** uncle. And it's like, remember Brew, them vampires try to talk inside your head. Every time one talks to you, you ask, "Who is

**Justin Hale:** yeah.

**Tyram:** this?" And then they won't be able to lie to you if you're vampires.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. That's so good. Yes. Origin

**Justin Hale:** Hell yeah. I love

**Christopher Hooper:** story.

**Justin Hale:** that. What should I be? Am

**Ali Leonard:** out

**Tyram:** Are you not

**Justin Hale:** I Brew? Like, how the inception of this being the rise

**Ali Leonard:** years

**Justin Hale:** of the island feels like it should be older than

**Ali Leonard:** a linebacker.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, no. It

**Justin Hale:** Brew? Brew is only like 10 or

**Tyram:** brew?

**Justin Hale:** whatever.

**Tyram:** Oh, yeah. Like like campaign lore here, right? Like rifts have been opening, dragons have been migrating,

**Christopher Hooper:** uh

**Tyram:** turtles apparently have been rising from the sea. All this is super f******


### [00:30:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, this could per this could be the event that caused brutal

**Tyram:** recent. Oh, we all die at the end and

**Justin Hale:** Okay. God,

**Tyram:** Brew's like, "Oh, I got to get out of here." No,

**Justin Hale:** so much trauma for

**Ali Leonard:** More

**Tyram:** no, we're just trauma farming for

**Christopher Hooper:** leaf.

**Ali Leonard:** show

**Tyram:** Brew. Um But it didn't come up in that last uh session, but like the trauma for Brew on that one is he saw the sheep get

**Justin Hale:** Brew.

**Tyram:** like hit by a truck and

**Justin Hale:** Why?

**Tyram:** die.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. Uh, any other uh characters uh we want to throw out? We've got Uncle Vu

**Tyram:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** going. Uh, we're also deciding if Justin is actually playing Blue Brew himself. What do you want to do,

**Justin Hale:** Why? I mean, I can be young brew. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Justin? Okay. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that's a really good question. So, we always talked about whether like Brew is like a teenage goblin or like an adult goblin or is this are we going to get angsty Brew Goblin going on?

**Justin Hale:** I guess so.

**Tyram:** This seems to be brewing his chemical romance phase. Oh, wait. We We actually did that exact same thing a few weeks ago, didn't we? But um Oh,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. There we

**Tyram:** you're in your green day phase, which is even younger, I

**Justin Hale:** go. Um, yeah, because I mean Brew would

**Tyram:** guess.

**Justin Hale:** be God, Brew would be a kid at this point, right?

**Tyram:** How

**Ali Leonard:** So, where are your

**Tyram:** do we decide like how quickly goblins

**Christopher Hooper:** They they mature very quickly.

**Ali Leonard:** aunts and

**Christopher Hooper:** So I I believe that

**Ali Leonard:** uncles?

**Christopher Hooper:** they mature by like age 10 or

**Justin Hale:** I think historically Brew is only like 10, which we can change that

**Tyram:** mature?

**Justin Hale:** for narrative purposes because he's he's been through enough s*** that that doesn't make

**Christopher Hooper:** something.

**Tyram:** Yeah, like it seems like you and

**Ali Leonard:** Well,

**Tyram:** like Silus's thing which included Brew

**Justin Hale:** sense.

**Ali Leonard:** thank Yeah.

**Tyram:** was like a few months before the campaign

**Ali Leonard:** So, it's pretty

**Tyram:** started and it seemed like we had been running with that crew for a

**Ali Leonard:** recent. Like a year maybe,

**Tyram:** while before that happened at least. Yeah, probably

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** right? So, you could be like

**Tyram:** more.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Bru's Bru's official age at right now is

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** 11. So we could we could bump his age up

**Ali Leonard:** 12. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** a little bit more and make him like Yeah, we

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. You just recently had a

**Christopher Hooper:** So

**Justin Hale:** could uh Well, no. I mean, sure. Like we could make him in his teenage phase at

**Ali Leonard:** birthday.

**Justin Hale:** what, like eight. So we could say this takes place a few years

**Tyram:** Yeah, I feel like putting yourself at 12 or 13 gives you plenty of runway for like

**Justin Hale:** prior. Yeah, I can I can

**Tyram:** having had all this stuff happen in your

**Justin Hale:** bump crew up a few

**Ali Leonard:** He's so

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Oh, man. Three.

**Justin Hale:** years. 14. Ancient. What an ancient

**Ali Leonard:** old.

**Tyram:** past. Okay. So,

**Tyram:** I'm going to go ahead and say that I am Brew's uncle.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey, real uncle or or

**Ali Leonard:** see.

**Christopher Hooper:** silly because of everyone else.

**Tyram:** names.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ali Leonard:** feel like it should just be one of those silly Irish names that's like got

**Christopher Hooper:** and

**Ali Leonard:** a million letters but it's spelled but it's just like

**Tyram:** It's like

**Ali Leonard:** yeah like quifa but it's like 12

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, the

**Ali Leonard:** just that's the first name that came to mind.

**Tyram:** Black hands. That's what she

**Luke Neverisky:** warning says, "Let the record The

**Justin Hale:** Yikes. Yep. Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** Ellie. The first

**Ali Leonard:** I'm just gonna

**Christopher Hooper:** sound

**Tyram:** wants. Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** be to make it short. I'm just going to be EA, but it's spelled the Irish one with all the

**Tyram:** ew. So, it like starts with an

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** vowels. Yeah. But that way it's

**Tyram:** Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** name. I was like, I just live on the vowels except you that

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** okay. You can't make me choose.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um All right. So, uh has it everyone gone over and

**Ali Leonard:** f*****.

**Christopher Hooper:** had a chance to look at the uh at the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, it's pretty Oh. Oh.

**Luke Neverisky:** expecting?

**Christopher Hooper:** minutes. Thanks. I'm really looking forward to it. It feels very very heavy to be carrying this this this

**Ali Leonard:** Congratulations.

**Christopher Hooper:** child. Um, do we want to go ahead and make Ellis's

**Ali Leonard:** Oh no, her name is

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Poopy

**Tyram:** probably normally I'd say like that's I guess since it's just a oneshot and it would really like derail things if we stopped in the middle to make a whole new character. Yeah, we probably

**Ali Leonard:** McPants.

**Christopher Hooper:** character? I was thinking that like like generally the first sound a baby makes is usually cry which would be really funny to be like grandma crybaby or something like that.

**Tyram:** should. I kind of like the idea that goblins come out super like not crying like she's really

**Christopher Hooper:** Um just

**Tyram:** chill and just like you

**Ali Leonard:** We're

**Christopher Hooper:** gassy.

**Tyram:** know

**Ali Leonard:** poopy.

**Tyram:** do, you know, for his disdain for Ali, um he uh it said that like Denland's catchphrase was those

**Christopher Hooper:** Justin.

**Tyram:** meddling orphans, which I don't remember saying even one time. So that was a weird thing for the AI to like really like it went hard on like the meddling orphans thing for Denlin, but it's like it definitely was not

**Christopher Hooper:** I think

**Tyram:** that prominent a thing as much as the AI made it seem it

**Christopher Hooper:** you did say it like what once or something like

**Tyram:** was. I maybe I said it once,

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Tyram:** but like I definitely didn't say it enough times for the AI to repeat it like

**Justin Hale:** It's all it takes, man. How dare you? How dare

**Tyram:** on four separate

**Justin Hale:** you even mutter words about

**Tyram:** occasions.

**Justin Hale:** orphans?

**Christopher Hooper:** You were obsessed with it last session if I remember

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

He is sweating profusely and he's standing in front of the chalkboard that is completely covered in circles, arrows, a stain of jam or blood. and he slaps a riding crop against the board, creating a cloud of chalk dust. Okay, does that make sense to everybody? The silence stretches. A fly buzzes and Grit stares at the party with those sprantic bulging

**Tyram:** What? What the hell am I looking

**Ali Leonard:** information on how best to

**Tyram:** All right. Now,

**Ali Leonard:** disturb

**Tyram:** I can't remember. Am I a rogue of ninth level? Cuz if so, I actually might be the one best suited for this here

**Ali Leonard:** Maybe I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** bullying. If you ain't a rogue, a rogue of nine of ninth level, then they don't call me

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. Right. Of course. Of

**Ali Leonard:** in

**Tyram:** No, you know what?

**Christopher Hooper:** fun,

**Tyram:** Yeah, I'm just going to move forward assuming I have

**Christopher Hooper:** kids.

**Tyram:** abilities equivalent to a uh soulblade rogue of nine level. All right. Okay. So, uh, yeah, I guess, uh, uh, Uncle Belch here is going to roll stealth and try to trail this here, uh,

**Luke Neverisky:** Do it. Do it. Do it. Do

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yeah, go

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead.

**Tyram:** Oracle. Okay, so that's a 23

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. Pretty

**Tyram:** on still.

**Christopher Hooper:** stealthy.

**Tyram:** Yeah, it was literally the worst thing

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah. I thought that was kind

**Tyram:** I could have rolled because I rolled the

**Christopher Hooper:** of long for you, but uh I wasn't going to say it in front of your

**Tyram:** two. It's a reliable talent

**Christopher Hooper:** friends.

**Tyram:** though is

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. So,

**Tyram:** 23. I can still boost it if you

**Justin Hale:** Get him. Hurry up. What are you waiting

**Tyram:** All

**Luke Neverisky:** belove. We got

**Christopher Hooper:** now. All right. So,

**Tyram:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** um

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** for?

**Christopher Hooper:** um you are moving through there's a huge you're moving through um it's basically a parade route that's coming right beside the bowling

**Tyram:** Self

**Christopher Hooper:** alley and down the lane is coming uh the caravan. Uh Drew, I I feel like you said you were making your way there

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** as well.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. I want to f****** run circles around this

**Ali Leonard:** Hey,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. You're

**Ali Leonard:** heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** heading full speed. Um, Uncle, what what was your name

**Luke Neverisky:** thing.

**Christopher Hooper:** again? Uncle Belch. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** Oops.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uncle Belch, you are you're you're sliding through this

**Tyram:** Belch.

**Christopher Hooper:** crowd um like butter through a a hot

**Ali Leonard:** Ouch.

**Christopher Hooper:** fork. um slinking through

**Tyram:** the old

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** and yeah, you end up uh making it to the caravan

**Tyram:** expression.

**Christopher Hooper:** at roughly the same time. Um at this point, uh

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** Drew has lost track of you. Um but you can see him and he uh currently is talking to a guard

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh of the caravan. Says,

**Luke Neverisky:** Hey, hey,


### [01:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** "Ult, what do you want, goblin? Would you like

**Luke Neverisky:** hey. Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** to see your future,

**Luke Neverisky:** But first, I'll race your own caravan. Just at least just at least 10

**Christopher Hooper:** Red? Okay, I will count for

**Luke Neverisky:** times. Okay, go.

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Go now. One. All right. And uh you now have some time. You you see your friend Drew uh your nephew uh Drew um running around the caravan. You're slinking. How are you gonna approach this caravan right

**Tyram:** Can I see the oracle from

**Christopher Hooper:** now? Um, give me a perception

**Tyram:** where I

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Tyram:** am? That's better. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** 20. Um, so what you see is a um you see a pretty like rough looking wagon, but it has been strewn with lace and you can smell the perfumes emanating from it. Um, it's been dressed up heavily with lots of fabrics and things. Um, but under it is a very old wagon pulled by very old horses. And within that wagon, you can make out um, it looks like you can make out a a woman smoking. Um, and you would guess that this is probably uh, Mistress Tatterbottom. Um to to give you context, it's like an enclosed um enclosed like wagon uh where like you would be able to sit across from each other. Um so you imagine that she basically has people come

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** into the door and then has their fortune read or um or things like that.

**Tyram:** All right. Um, I see where Drew

**Christopher Hooper:** uh briefly. Um he shows up every

**Tyram:** is,

**Christopher Hooper:** few seconds as he's running circles around the the

**Tyram:** right? Okay. Um, are there like attendants or like um any like people who like work for the Oracle who are like walking around? Do they have like a like a uniform that they're

**Christopher Hooper:** caravan. Yeah. Yeah. So, you did see

**Tyram:** wearing or

**Christopher Hooper:** Drew talk to one of the like attended guard type looking things. Um, it looks like he's basically a mercenary type that has been

**Tyram:** anything?

**Christopher Hooper:** draped with like some like a colorful cape to cover like his like kind of shoddy armor.

**Tyram:** Okay. Do I see anybody wearing one of those colorful capes or just one of those colorful capes on like like a laundry line or something like that in this

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, no. This it looks like uh the cape looks like it was

**Tyram:** caravan?

**Christopher Hooper:** taken from like the ribbons and fabric that now are draped around the wagon and just like snipped off and

**Ali Leonard:** Beautiful. Not

**Christopher Hooper:** a hole cut into it and then put on him basically.

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, you know, I'm just going to, I guess, try to take the direct approach here. I'm just going to try to sneak up to uh the Oracle herself and just like, you know, directly just ask her what we need to

**Ali Leonard:** feeling. I love

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** like. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Are are you you're sneaking past the attendant? Is that

**Tyram:** How close to

**Christopher Hooper:** right? So, she's

**Tyram:** me is

**Christopher Hooper:** inside uh a like enclosed wagon, right? Um, and

**Tyram:** she? All right. You said there was like part of the her

**Christopher Hooper:** there's

**Tyram:** thing was ripped off,

**Ali Leonard:** the hood,

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh I don't No, I don't think

**Tyram:** right? Like that the guard

**Christopher Hooper:** so.

**Tyram:** had like taken like ripped off some of the stuff from her her

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh. Um so like the there's basically

**Tyram:** thing.

**Ali Leonard:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** like an enclosed wood wagon and then over it is like just like glued on like ribbons and fabrics to make it look like fancy. Um, but under it is like an enclosed old like rickety

**Ali Leonard:** Wait,

**Christopher Hooper:** wagon. Does that make sense?

**Ali Leonard:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** So, so yeah. So that's

**Tyram:** Yeah. And there's like not like a window or anything into the

**Christopher Hooper:** what you saw. You saw a woman smoking through the

**Tyram:** wagon. Oh, okay. Um I'm just going to try to teleport through the window then.

**Christopher Hooper:** window. Um, okay. Uh, cool. There's no check for that, right?

**Tyram:** It's you within 30 ft of me. Okay. Yeah. I'll just misty step uh through the window that I can see through and like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, you pop in

**Tyram:** appear right next to

**Christopher Hooper:** and there is an older woman. Um, she has those like glassy blue eyes of a blind

**Ali Leonard:** Thank you.

**Christopher Hooper:** woman and she has um a

**Tyram:** her.

**Christopher Hooper:** like the fabrics um a cowl around her. Um, and she has just these like uh very like you know uh super thin skin that like is very like hanging on and stuff wispy.

**Tyram:** them blue veins that I can see

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah. Yeah, exactly.

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and uh with that stealth, yeah, she doesn't respond to you. Uh, and you're in

**Tyram:** through. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** I mean, if she's an oracle, she should f****** know you're in there. You know what I mean? What a bad oracle. Unless she like stabs

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, man. Yeah, mad respect.

**Ali Leonard:** you, then I would respect

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that gets

**Ali Leonard:** that. No

**Christopher Hooper:** there.

**Tyram:** Um, all right.

**Luke Neverisky:** him nuts for

**Ali Leonard:** offense.

**Luke Neverisky:** sure.

**Tyram:** Um, hey, I'm uh here with your dinner.

**Christopher Hooper:** Thank you. Please leave it on the

**Tyram:** Oh, but hey, while I'm here, uh, what would be the best place for a band of

**Christopher Hooper:** table.

**Tyram:** goblin, um, pilgrims to cause a disturbance

**Ellis Taylor:** Do you want us to roll

**Justin Hale:** E

**Christopher Hooper:** who who's

**Tyram:** right?

**Ellis Taylor:** initiative or just

**Christopher Hooper:** up? just go.

**Tyram:** Hey, Vanessa, can we talk for a

**Ali Leonard:** God,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, give me a persuasion

**Tyram:** minute?

**Ellis Taylor:** go? Can I cast zone of

**Ali Leonard:** if we have to be nicer, this is going to be so

**Ellis Taylor:** truth? I can

**Christopher Hooper:** check. Uh, if you think that'll

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** cast Zone of

**Christopher Hooper:** help.

**Tyram:** Um 17. Do you want me to make it

**Ellis Taylor:** Truth.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah, just a little bit

**Tyram:** better? All

**Ellis Taylor:** Wait, before I cast it, I know Eva didn't actually kill Vanessa.

**Ali Leonard:** hard.

**Christopher Hooper:** actually.

**Tyram:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** What actually happened? Can you guys tell me what actually happened before I commit to

**Christopher Hooper:** Eve

**Tyram:** We were in the

**Christopher Hooper:** totally killed

**Tyram:** bathroom. Okay. So, you of course know that 7-Eleven

**Ellis Taylor:** this?

**Ali Leonard:** in the baby trading

**Tyram:** bathrooms have chemistry labs in them, right? In the

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Vanessa.

**Tyram:** baby changing station. Common knowledge about 7-Elevens, not just in the campaign, but in real life. Um, we took

**Ali Leonard:** station. We were in there for hours apparently and then all of a sudden Vanessa was

**Tyram:** hours

**Ali Leonard:** knocking on the door. She didn't enter the code, so she couldn't even get in

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** anyway. And then she's trying to get in. She's like, I need to poop. And I'm like, poop on the floor like a normal person. And then maybe I said that I wanted I hope she would die by beasting from anifylactic shock and that she's weird for drinking toilet water, but then she went out and died of a heart attack. So like, is that my fault or is that her fault for not

**Tyram:** Okay, so I think two things are true here at the same time. I do think that Ally laid it

**Ali Leonard:** pooping?

**Tyram:** on pretty thick, but I also think it's true that objectively it was not our fault

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean, goblins die every day a

**Tyram:** that she

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, Zone of Truth is not going to

**Ali Leonard:** Goblins die every day of a heart

**Tyram:** died.

**Ellis Taylor:** help. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** attack. And now, is that a genetic condition or do we have a

**Tyram:** Yeah. Okay. Anyway, so I railed

**Ali Leonard:** heart attack murderer going

**Tyram:** Anyway, so I with the boost I got it to 23.

**Christopher Hooper:** sec. Uh yeah, one of the

**Tyram:** That

**Christopher Hooper:** Vanessa's starts

**Tyram:** helped. Does it also help I take a chair, I turn

**Ali Leonard:** around?

**Tyram:** it around backwards, and then I sit in it, you know,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Super approachable.

**Christopher Hooper:** talking. Yeah. Yeah. I I think

**Tyram:** like trying to rap with the teens, you

**Christopher Hooper:** that I think that's how you get this high. Yeah. You like really connect with

**Tyram:** know?

**Christopher Hooper:** her. And uh one of the one of the rays says, "You really you really ready to hear me? Kill me

**Tyram:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** for

**Tyram:** I'm ready to listen and I'm ready to talk.

**Ali Leonard:** Absolutely.

**Christopher Hooper:** real?" Well, it was ever since I was born and given the name Vanessa and that's when the trouble started. Do you think I chose to say Vanessa when I was born? Well, technically I did, but I wasn't informed about it because I was a

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** baby, a baby

**Tyram:** I remember two weeks ago when you were born.

**Christopher Hooper:** goblin. And the whole two

**Ali Leonard:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** weeks, Auntie Eva has been so mean to

**Ali Leonard:** my god.

**Christopher Hooper:** me, and I'm only two weeks

**Tyram:** Yeah. Okay. So, here's

**Christopher Hooper:** old.

**Tyram:** actually here's what I think is an important thing to note here. It has become clear to me that Godfather Britt has been driving a wedge between the two branches of this family. But the scales have really fallen from my eyes tonight. He sucks. He just objectively sucks. He

**Ali Leonard:** God. That's true.

**Tyram:** keeps following us around. He keeps like stirring the pot. He

**Ellis Taylor:** And then he did

**Tyram:** tried to have us blow up the eard drum of our turtle cod

**Ellis Taylor:** it. And then he did it. He threw the dynamite.

**Tyram:** tonight and then he just did it.

**Ellis Taylor:** He did it. We weren't going to do it. We weren't going to hurt the

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah, barely scorch marks on my hand. We had

**Ellis Taylor:** turtle. He tried to blow our arms off.

**Christopher Hooper:** You call us take a dime

**Tyram:** to catch a stick of dynamite

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** earlier. He threw a stick of dynamite and so yeah, I think that he's

**Ali Leonard:** Heat.

**Tyram:** whipping you and Elfie against each other, you

**Christopher Hooper:** by I just wanted to use the bathroom though.

**Tyram:** know.

**Ellis Taylor:** Just the stair.

**Tyram:** Well, as you know, 7-Eleven is one of the few places with the chemistry facilities we needed in order to make our explosives and

**Christopher Hooper:** We have this whole explosives lab right

**Tyram:** fireworks. So we

**Ellis Taylor:** There's a whole

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I don't know

**Tyram:** use you can s***

**Ellis Taylor:** bunch of buckets.

**Ali Leonard:** if you're I don't know if you're taught that you have to you can s*** anywhere.

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Ali Leonard:** Vanessa, I do apologize. I feel like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. And with

**Ali Leonard:** I did not give you a great shake on things and I kind of

**Christopher Hooper:** that

**Tyram:** anywhere.

**Ali Leonard:** should have maybe been nicer. He

**Tyram:** I think because I think because Brit poisoned you against her and

**Ali Leonard:** did. He told me you drank toilet

**Christopher Hooper:** And with

**Tyram:** her against

**Ali Leonard:** water. Christmas

**Christopher Hooper:** that, two of the

**Ali Leonard:** magic and these other Vesses. I think if you were still alive, and I'm very sad that you're not, we would have really gotten along and I would have loved to show you fireworks and gotten

**Christopher Hooper:** disappear.

**Ali Leonard:** your creative

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I would like Auntie Poopy to give me a dexterity saving

**Ellis Taylor:** Why me? Okay, hold on. Let me get back to that page.

**Tyram:** Damn. A real breakthrough

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, not 20.

**Ali Leonard:** input.

**Christopher Hooper:** throw. And it's like, but you're still right now. And uh, she tries

**Ali Leonard:** What did you say?

**Christopher Hooper:** to tackle you off. Um, she screeches, "You're still being mean to me right now and you're not being

**Tyram:** there.

**Ali Leonard:** Sorry. I

**Christopher Hooper:** understanding of this conversation." And she tries to, "No,

**Ali Leonard:** am Oh, Auntie Poopy, join us in this

**Christopher Hooper:** Auntie Poopy." Um, and she tries to throw Auntie Poopy, but Auntie Poopy out

**Ali Leonard:** chair. Auntie Poopy, sit this backwards chair with

**Christopher Hooper:** of the way.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, I'll sit sit on a

**Tyram:** Oh, turn

**Ellis Taylor:** chair up back. I don't have a

**Ali Leonard:** us
