**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** the

**Ellis Taylor:** there. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** cuz they're going to be at their house

**Christopher Hooper:** Uhhuh.

**Tyram:** We had thought ahead a little

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Ellis. Like I think the w

**Ellis Taylor:** camper. It's got a little built-in

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, hang

**Christopher Hooper:** yard.

**Tyram:** that

**Ellis Taylor:** propane heater. It's It's going to get down to 23, but it was 56 today.

**Walden Briarhelm:** That sounds so

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, all

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. It's so

**Justin Hale:** is so normal

**Walden Briarhelm:** lovely.

**Luke Neverisky:** on.

**Tyram:** Last I saw Ally was

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** a shrug

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah. She's

**Christopher Hooper:** I She went to

**Justin Hale:** here. I'm sick, too. I'm still

**Tyram:** emoji.

**Christopher Hooper:** bed. You're

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Ellis Taylor:** asleep.

**Christopher Hooper:** what?

**Justin Hale:** I said I'm sick. I'm still

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, but you're um you're fighting through. Your dedication is

**Justin Hale:** here. Yeah. Thank you for that validation. I appreciate

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Watch for 24-hour non-stop.

**Christopher Hooper:** unmeasurable. Some people just don't care as much, you know.

**Justin Hale:** it. No.

**Ellis Taylor:** You care plenty. I know you're gonna listen to

**Justin Hale:** Yep. Looking at the

**Ellis Taylor:** this. I believe in

**Christopher Hooper:** She doesn't

**Justin Hale:** rest.

**Tyram:** It's not her dedication. It's just her

**Justin Hale:** I think it's

**Tyram:** weakness that, you know, prevents her from being No, no, I'm just kidding.

**Justin Hale:** different once you have kids. It's like I have to be able to function and crap

**Ellis Taylor:** you. Yeah. And they're just

**Walden Briarhelm:** What's

**Christopher Hooper:** listen.

**Justin Hale:** regardless. So, I'm going to do the fun that I want to do,

**Ellis Taylor:** as sick as you are, but for some reason it doesn't seem to affect them. And so you're dying and they're still running around like nothing's wrong.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes.

**Justin Hale:** too. Well, the bullshitty part of it too is like when kids get a sinus infection, they're just like, "Oh, here's some moxicil. You'll be good in three days." When you're adult, they're like, "Puff it

**Christopher Hooper:** Where's Where's

**Justin Hale:** out." We're being a little

**Tyram:** Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** my emoxicylin? And they're like, you shouldn't be seeing a pediatrician. You're over

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's a good joke. I like that.

**Christopher Hooper:** 30.

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Tyram:** What a bunch of just mental assholes

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Now, here's a lollipop.

**Tyram:** though. There we go. That makes it

**Justin Hale:** the lollipops. Damn

**Tyram:** all

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, um, do y'all um do y'all want to uh go over what's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes, please. I forgot that the podcast

**Christopher Hooper:** happened last

**Ellis Taylor:** existed.

**Christopher Hooper:** time? And you can't read

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, two times ago, um, we were all hanging out in Grayport

**Ellis Taylor:** So,

**Tyram:** and, uh, you'll be pleased to know, and I was furious to

**Ellis Taylor:** No.

**Tyram:** learn that, uh, Chalk Rock is thriving apparently. Like, he sounds like Patrick Morbertton now. He has like this confident attitude and I f****** hate

**Christopher Hooper:** either. After that they could not

**Tyram:** it. But um no, apparently he's doing a pretty good

**Ellis Taylor:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** leave. Once that happened, they were like,

**Tyram:** job running the city and

**Christopher Hooper:** "We gotta get the f*** out of this

**Tyram:** everything it definitely hurried me out the door. That's for damn sure. But um but no, I mean, he's doing a pretty solid job running the city. Um um Oh, but uh Brew

**Justin Hale:** Wow.

**Tyram:** and Silas were rooting around in Helga's apartment. We found a bunch of

**Christopher Hooper:** city.

**Tyram:** our old journals and we like you know kind of trash the place of course. Um but in the journals we found out that the leader of our old gang through Sander might still be alive

**Luke Neverisky:** Thank

**Tyram:** because uh his body was not with the rest of the uh system circle bodies when they went back to the area later. So um that also sped us along to try to uh get to Greyport. Oh, and apparently uh Ma's goddess has taken human form. It is not too far from Greyport. So, yet another reason to go

**Ellis Taylor:** Wait, who what took human form? Sorry.

**Tyram:** there. Uh Ma's moon

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay,

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** Luna.

**Tyram:** goddess. Do you remember when the moon exploded and we like that one

**Ellis Taylor:** Luna. Yeah.

**Tyram:** like humanoid figure like fell from it? Apparently, she landed nearsh to Greyport. Oh, apparently she's going by Luna because she's creatively bankrupt. But um but at any rate though, um as we made our journey north

**Christopher Hooper:** Wait, but you're missing a key detail. Who did you

**Tyram:** though,

**Christopher Hooper:** find in Helga's

**Tyram:** um I don't think that's a key detail, but okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** promise.

**Christopher Hooper:** apartment?

**Tyram:** Um was his name Brad?

**Ellis Taylor:** Brad.

**Tyram:** No, not Chad. Brad, like

**Christopher Hooper:** No.

**Tyram:** Jonathan. That's right. They both had Jay names. Jonathan and Jessica. Okay. Uh Jonathan, who was a vault gu a vault guard

**Christopher Hooper:** Jonathan.

**Tyram:** for a session that I don't think you were present for, so you don't even know who they are. Anyway, um was preparing a romantic dinner for his girlfriend who we set him up

**Ellis Taylor:** I think I I think I I think I missed that

**Tyram:** with. Is that enough detail on Jonathan and

**Ellis Taylor:** half of the session, but that was when a bunch of you guys were playing like

**Tyram:** Jess?

**Ellis Taylor:** characters that you were going to die or

**Tyram:** It was before, it was the one before that

**Ellis Taylor:** something. Yeah.

**Tyram:** when we were being ourselves. Um, and then like you guys

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yeah.


### [00:10:00]

**Tyram:** were the other half of the heist where you guys were getting the F-150. We were in the vault uh while you guys got the get getaway vehicle. While we're in the vault, we set up Jonathan and the other guard there, Jessica, um, on a romantic date. And uh apparently they're still together and they uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. In

**Tyram:** are having a romantic dinner while we're there

**Ellis Taylor:** in the B in H's apartment.

**Tyram:** um and held his apartment

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool.

**Tyram:** because apparently some dude called Trevor uh knew how to let him in. Now I'm suspicious of Trevor, but you know, we just

**Christopher Hooper:** in you

**Tyram:** we just eventually left. So yeah, it's

**Christopher Hooper:** pretended to be gods, I think. Um

**Tyram:** whatever. We did. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah.

**Tyram:** Well, we were trying to figure out what he was doing there, so we kind of uh clung to the ceiling and uh talked in his ear a little bit, but anyway,

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** um then eventually we did leave and um but Scarlet let us know that um if we go by Red's old Goliath village, we could pick up a bunch of things called reality stones to help finish the pocket village. So, we stopped there on the way and some Eldorans were there. Apparently, they had some sort of contraption which we think was teleporting materials back to either Eldderon or maybe to their moon base or something. But if Elderon wants to do something, we just automatically want to stop them. So, we did. Um, we blew up the machine. Uh, Ally pushed one of them through the teleportation device and I panced one of them. So, yeah, it was great. Um, pretty sure they're dead, but uh we got the reality stones and uh made our way back to the path and then we arrived in Greyport and uh we all uh took turns describing cool changes that have taken place in the last 200 years, including like a big statue of the Steve squad over the entrance. Um Zane uh Dne Zoo has grown quite significantly. Uh they're building a Lenny T concert hall. Um, uh, Caspian's old community center is, uh, growing and thriving and things like that. Um, did I miss any of the details that got

**Luke Neverisky:** That sounds

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, There's a restaurant, there's a college, um, Lenny T

**Tyram:** added? Yeah, those were all part of like the

**Christopher Hooper:** venue, and at the very end of that session,

**Tyram:** Caspian's like community center place.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** you saw your friend in front of a

**Tyram:** Yeah. Okay. So, we headed to Jasper's uh bankery, brewery, bakery, whatever the order is there, and uh our friend uh Therander apparently was there. So, that's

**Christopher Hooper:** bakery.

**Tyram:** what cemented the the fact, the indisputable fact that Silus and Brew are now the greatest detectives in the party because we found the guy we were looking for in the first place we looked. So, you know, clearly we are the best at tracking people down.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, this detective thing is not hard Dark.

**Tyram:** Um, yeah, you always complain about how hard it is, but obviously it's very easy.

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Tyram:** Um, but um, but then the next session started and Toeer blew up the f****** bakery immediately. Like that was the first thing that happened. And uh, we managed to go in and rescue Thrander. But uh we also or I should say Bruce spotted the uh the saboturs, the attackers, and uh we had a big chase scene. Um we managed to get up onto the rooftops and uh chase them down. Brew had his uh his uh familiar scouting ahead and he was able to follow them through that. Um that is true. They were also completely cramping Bruce style with the blowing up thing regardless of what they were blowing up. Um, we had a cool rooftop fight. Um, and we weren't the only ones chasing. It was the Ironclaws who done blew up the place. And we weren't the only ones chasing him, though. The people from the Order of St. George were also chasing them down.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, the song

**Tyram:** Um, eventually Ma managed to use his monk speed to run out ahead

**Justin Hale:** again. I said Toeer's gonna sing Ellis the song

**Tyram:** of Sorry, Justin, what' you

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** again, too.

**Tyram:** say? Okay, let me know to when you're ready and I will cue you up for it. Um but um anyway, Omar used his monk speed to get out ahead of the people we were chasing and that cut them off and allowed the uh the St. George people to catch up with

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** them. And uh we made contact

**Christopher Hooper:** Hello.

**Tyram:** with the St. George people after all the uh the fools were taken down and um we went back with them to their headquarters, which is this uh pub, but has a bunch of like dragon carcasses and s*** on the outside. So, not the most subtle location they could be in, but

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I think I remember

**Tyram:** um Toeer, are you ready for the

**Christopher Hooper:** the words.

**Tyram:** song? Okay, so we go in and all the knights are hanging out and

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, it's the dragon sword.

**Tyram:** they sing us a song.

**Christopher Hooper:** We drink all day. We f*** all night, I guess. And it's almost night time. I guess it's time to

**Tyram:** Toeer. There's a little

**Walden Briarhelm:** I liked the the

**Tyram:** bit more to it than that, but that is the most important elements.

**Walden Briarhelm:** remixes Better.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** You're muted, Ellis.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm assuming it's an order of all dudes. And then uh L's and Olivia are just looking at each other really awkwardly and at

**Christopher Hooper:** f***.

**Ellis Taylor:** um oh shoot. What's your name now? Not Hell's Liliana. We're all just

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** like

**Tyram:** Yes. That was never specified, but it does seem like most of the ones we've run into so

**Ellis Taylor:** If there's the end of that song, I

**Tyram:** far are dudes. Yes.

**Luke Neverisky:** William.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm really I'm really sad that Alli's not here because I was going to have Elizabeth and um so One thing you missed out is that you actually split off from El Smith and Olivia after the

**Tyram:** probably. Oh, yeah. To to uh explain

**Ellis Taylor:** probably ah

**Tyram:** why your characters weren't there, we said that you guys took their Sander, who is, you know, recovering from the explosion, to a safe place, and that this is where you guys are. So, we've all reunited. Um Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** explosion.

**Tyram:** um the these Order of St. George guys did see that I have the uh dragon orb and um they want to talk about it now. So, that's I think the first thing we're going to do here after we wake up hopefully having been able to sleep

**Ellis Taylor:** Everyone's

**Tyram:** in spite of the constant f****** going on on the floors

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, we'll have to just

**Tyram:** above

**Christopher Hooper:** speedun through what y'all experienced, which uh y'all went through the town. You got some scarves at the market. You came at the market, you came across a bachelor party. They're looking for some fun to have and you said, "Hey, why don't you tag along with us?" And then as you do, and then you led them to the same inn, and they just gather as you were going, you just collected more and more bachelor parties until you had five or six with you. And then they all ended up at the end and you're like, "All right, well, see you guys." And then their standard took you down into the hidden dragon hunter

**Tyram:** Was that El

**Christopher Hooper:** layer. Yeah, that's

**Tyram:** Smith then Olivia's perspectives? I don't remember any of that.

**Christopher Hooper:** what they were going to do, but uh you know else make it. So, we'll just skip over all that stuff. Um, which brings us now to um you're able to get accommodations at um in so we come back to the um Dragon's Hide and um you were just giving given accommodations. The last thing you saw of Olivia and

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Elvis was they had fallen asleep in the medbay uh by Thirstander. Um the rest of you were get in given your own clean rooms uh within the more um official uh St. George uh portion of the of the building. Um there are these nice like decadent rooms with a lot of like overt dragon um paraphernelia. I think there was like a dragon tooth uh toothbrushes uh inside like a a carved uh cuff that looks like a dragon. Speaking of dragon, my little dragon um and uh and uh you have um uh did what do you all um I want you all to think about how you um each of you prepare in the evening and what you might be doing before you settle down for a long rest and um prepare for the morning and any um planning or questions you might be thinking of and how you want to approach talking to Commander Tannondelle that is the leader

**Luke Neverisky:** I will say

**Christopher Hooper:** of St. George's

**Luke Neverisky:** that Liliana's bedtime prep is getting her clothes out ready, folding them very neatly, putting them on the dresser, um making sure all of the all of the pillows and the blankets on the bed are like uh very straight orderly before she gets in it. and

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, I

**Luke Neverisky:** um light some incense in the room and does some quiet

**Christopher Hooper:** order.

**Luke Neverisky:** meditation and affirmations. That's a

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. Is she the type

**Luke Neverisky:** routine.

**Christopher Hooper:** that once she gets in the cover, she like creases it around

**Ellis Taylor:** just I don't I

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes, it has to be perfectly symmetrical and

**Christopher Hooper:** her?

**Ellis Taylor:** just

**Tyram:** Does Liliana have like OCD? I just want to know if that's like a

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah, it's not intentional, but more so just like

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. A character

**Tyram:** a

**Ellis Taylor:** can't


### [00:20:00]

**Luke Neverisky:** she's very I don't know. Um, I'm trying to think what would Helisana do and that that is that is

**Christopher Hooper:** tree. Um that's that's wonderful. Yeah, you

**Tyram:** thing.

**Christopher Hooper:** have a very pleasant evening. Um there's enough floor space to be able to do some stretching, some pre-bed stretching. Um

**Luke Neverisky:** that

**Christopher Hooper:** all that sort of thing. Um Oh, yeah. Um All right. Anyone else want to

**Walden Briarhelm:** I imagine that uh Elmo would

**Christopher Hooper:** go?

**Walden Briarhelm:** do like a form of like nighttime tai chi, something to calm his nerves from the potential fight and rooftop run and then do his typical little pop into a shell and wrap up for the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um and uh you do your tai chi. Um, you get ready, you just pop in. When do you like have like blankets or anything like already set up in your in your turtle

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, no. It's It's not like a Pokeball. It's more like uh like I I I sit like the You just sit on top of the bed. It's kind of like how a dog bed would work. You just want somewhere cozy to set your shell to rest

**Christopher Hooper:** shell?

**Walden Briarhelm:** rest your

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, are any of y'all

**Walden Briarhelm:** shell. I could very

**Christopher Hooper:** like bunking up and and sharing a

**Walden Briarhelm:** likely be in somebody else's room. I would just take up shell

**Tyram:** I mean, it sounds like you guys kind of have like a similar like uh stretch

**Walden Briarhelm:** space.

**Luke Neverisky:** That's true. There could be some

**Christopher Hooper:** room?

**Tyram:** routine going on. Maybe you guys should just room

**Luke Neverisky:** combination with incense, meditation, stretch, type,

**Christopher Hooper:** Give it a go.

**Tyram:** up.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm I'm digging this. It's like a 1 plus 1 equals 3. We are going to rest very well

**Luke Neverisky:** etc. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Bye. Um, all right. Anyone else have a pre-time ritual or anything you're trying to do before you uh go to

**Tyram:** stylist might contemplate if there's a way to like soundproof the room a little

**Christopher Hooper:** sleep? Okay. Yeah. What are you thinking

**Tyram:** bit like so that we don't like I want to try to like put like

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** blankets on the ceiling maybe so that like we don't hear through the floorboards above us uh these uh these

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, okay. I was

**Christopher Hooper:** about? Will it

**Tyram:** runchy lights. I'm trying to think where we don't

**Ellis Taylor:** like, "What are you getting ready to

**Christopher Hooper:** actually

**Tyram:** hear stuff from the outside, not where like you seemed like you

**Ellis Taylor:** do?" Yeah. I was like, "Are you calling Naomi? What's

**Tyram:** were thinking it was the other way around, but no.

**Ellis Taylor:** happening here?

**Tyram:** Um Oh, I mean, if Silus could, he probably would, but apparently that's like on ice for a while.

**Ellis Taylor:** A that's right. I guess I did

**Tyram:** But Well, didn't we say that like their dimensional

**Ellis Taylor:** that. Yeah. But at the end she get at the end she sent you a

**Tyram:** portal is like having to get leaked or

**Ellis Taylor:** message.

**Tyram:** whatever? That's true. I do have a sending stone. You know what?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** Actually, yes. That's probably would be part of Silus's bedtime routine is like uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, let's go. Let's go give

**Tyram:** he'd probably call Naomi like, you know, like swap

**Christopher Hooper:** Francis a giant kiss.

**Tyram:** notes and he probably would want to tell her a lot about the day because like uh found my old friend still alive and almost saw him die again, but then he didn't die. So, you know, little roller coaster of emotions

**Luke Neverisky:** Jesus.

**Tyram:** there. So yeah, I guess that's Silus's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Wait, so Jasper's place got blowed up.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, kiss. Good night.

**Tyram:** routine is to uh try to

**Ellis Taylor:** Is Jasper okay or did Toer try to kill him again?

**Justin Hale:** Um, you

**Tyram:** like Oh, we did not check. We didn't

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool.

**Justin Hale:** don't know.

**Tyram:** think about that till after the session was

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** Are

**Justin Hale:** We should probably check on that soon.

**Tyram:** over. That should be something we do tomorrow. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** I think Olivia's gonna wake up in the middle of the

**Christopher Hooper:** you

**Tyram:** Um to to be fair, there was a lot of there was a lot going

**Ellis Taylor:** night, be like, "Jasper

**Tyram:** on. Like there was a very

**Christopher Hooper:** ready? Got to go playing D

**Tyram:** immediate uh call to action. We had to go chase the bad

**Christopher Hooper:** and D. Okay, I'm going to go

**Tyram:** guys. Maybe that is something that

**Christopher Hooper:** play to you friends. Okay, I'll play with you in the

**Tyram:** Ellmith and Olivia did was check in on Jasper. I don't

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I think Toer's

**Christopher Hooper:** morning. We have

**Ellis Taylor:** super paying

**Justin Hale:** This is how he always talks to me. This

**Tyram:** know.

**Justin Hale:** isn't how he

**Tyram:** I don't

**Ellis Taylor:** attention.

**Christopher Hooper:** Saturday.

**Justin Hale:** Um, something we don't need Toeer for. Uh, I haven't been great about re-upping the spell rot tattoos, and I don't think Liliana's gotten one yet. So, I will ask her if she

**Tyram:** office.

**Justin Hale:** wants one, and then you can pick, uh, I think it's any level one spell that you

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, and it's just always prepared in one time. Is that right?

**Justin Hale:** want. Yep. Mine is just a

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Justin Hale:** uh basically a recast of uh Crimson if he ever dies or gets knocked out. So mine just stays that way. But if Yeah, if you ever use it, we have to reimpip

**Tyram:** Well, mine was shield, but now that I have the defensive

**Justin Hale:** it. Yeah, we

**Tyram:** duelist feat, shield might be a little

**Justin Hale:** can change that

**Tyram:** redundant. Yeah, I I'll think about that. I'll let you know.

**Justin Hale:** if Toer's up for it too. We have like multiple days in game that have

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** passed. We can like reccon the tattoos too. Totally up to him though. He wants me to make if he wants to make me remember then, you know.

**Luke Neverisky:** These are things that you just kind of keep in your head, Justin, that we have these.

**Justin Hale:** Boo. Uh yeah. Yeah. clear clearly top of mind for me since I've had this ability for months and

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, what

**Justin Hale:** hardly ever remember to apply

**Christopher Hooper:** do you need to do to apply Is it just like

**Justin Hale:** them. It's a once per day thing that I can give someone a a tattoo that is it basically stores a a level one spell. Um but I can only do it once per day. So every new day I can give someone a new

**Ellis Taylor:** Whoa. Oh my

**Justin Hale:** tattoo and it stays until they use it.

**Ellis Taylor:** god.

**Justin Hale:** So, um, so like mine I use on fine familiar for crimson.

**Christopher Hooper:** a

**Justin Hale:** So, like it's sort of cheating in that way that like it doesn't go away until crimson gets knocked out and then I have to apply it

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Well, Crimson King got knocked out. That's

**Justin Hale:** again. No, that's not that's not why I told you

**Ellis Taylor:** $25. Half Johnson.

**Christopher Hooper:** fine. Um I I was hearing

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** but I couldn't mute myself as I tried to get Astra in bed. Um.

**Justin Hale:** We were all very upset to hear

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh. Daddy, I'll

**Justin Hale:** the

**Christopher Hooper:** be alone.

**Justin Hale:** cube. It's me with a Can I have one more hug? Okay. Can I have five more? Okay. How about 10 more hugs? I'm like, dude, I'm gonna be here all

**Christopher Hooper:** Um. Um. So,

**Justin Hale:** night.

**Christopher Hooper:** um you as you walk through to your room, you um you realize you're getting taken to like a whole other wing, the like backside of this building. And so by the time you get to your room, it's kind of like being in a tall hotel in like a night district where you can like kind of hear muffled from the street, but it's it's like not like super loud. Um, so you can definitely seclude yourself enough to be able to take any phone calls and and not feel like there's a bunch of banging next door. Um, figuratively and lit literally. Um, all right. Um, and so Brew, uh, were you you were kind of getting into your like night routine and were were you were you uh working on your tattoos

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's usually when I do them if somebody needs one that night. Liliana specifically

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** then? Oh, cool. All

**Justin Hale:** hasn't had one yet, so she's up for

**Christopher Hooper:** right, cool, cool, cool. I will uh let y'all keep track of that.

**Tyram:** Is it just any first level spell or is it the

**Justin Hale:** Uh, let me check. I think it's any first

**Tyram:** specific class?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um um

**Justin Hale:** level.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** so uh let's see. I think I think maybe what I'll do is um why don't you all give me um Why don't you all give me a perception check? Why don't we do a group perception check

**Justin Hale:** You would like that. You would just love that, wouldn't

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Yep. I want to get those uh those dice muscles, you know, working early with a nice nice quick stretch.

**Justin Hale:** you? 14 for

**Tyram:** text

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh 14 16. Yeah, nice. Um and I It

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** looks like uh looks like Ellis is occupied,

**Tyram:** turn.

**Christopher Hooper:** so

**Ellis Taylor:** Sorry, we had to go take a potty break if someone wants to roll for

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** I got you. I got you. Oh, and that one. Very

**Justin Hale:** Um yeah, no

**Ellis Taylor:** Nailed

**Christopher Hooper:** nice.

**Justin Hale:** um no class restriction. It can be a cantrip or a

**Luke Neverisky:** Got it.

**Justin Hale:** first level spell, but it can only be used

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** once.

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, I probably would get a lot of use out of Hunter's

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Tyram:** Mark. And it would be pretty funny if we have yet another character who

**Ellis Taylor:** I was about to say, who would

**Tyram:** used Hunter's

**Ellis Taylor:** use hunter's mark? That's a dumb

**Christopher Hooper:** gotcha. That's pretty useless.


### [00:30:00]

**Tyram:** Mark. The

**Ellis Taylor:** spell. It was

**Tyram:** signature ranger

**Ellis Taylor:** concentration. There was other stuff that was so much more fun to use that I used a

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, okay. So,

**Tyram:** spell.

**Christopher Hooper:** um, and and Liliana, you kind of tuck in, you you do your nightly routine. Um, but

**Ellis Taylor:** lot.

**Christopher Hooper:** you uh you really struggle to get some sleep because you're just able to hear like the lots of activity in the hallways, people coming and going. Um, you um it it's not necessarily like any one group that's making a lot of noise, but there's activity constantly in this building throughout the evening. Um uh you both independently at different nights hear muffled conversations that are happening um as people are going to your rooms. Um Liliana at one point you hear um you hear what sounds like an iate it sounds like two goblins yelling at each other. Uh, and one uh is sounds like an elderly elderly uh old man old goblin man uh weeping. Uh he he he was just irate and mortified about a dragon attack in the south and the other is just like kind of building it up only throwing gas on the fire as they're they're also um recanting uh how their whole village was destroyed. Um, uh, you, um, hear some people just passing talking about, um, that one of the, uh, one of the knights is in the harbor, uh,

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, I just quit that job

**Christopher Hooper:** putting together a ship, um, trying

**Ellis Taylor:** because you know the

**Christopher Hooper:** to buy passage to explore a site in in the

**Ellis Taylor:** just don't worry about that. What

**Christopher Hooper:** sea. Um and then the morning. Uh yeah, and those are

**Ellis Taylor:** is that

**Luke Neverisky:** Interesting. All

**Christopher Hooper:** some things you hear uh as you're just trying to

**Ellis Taylor:** thing?

**Christopher Hooper:** sleep. Um but otherwise, you all get

**Ellis Taylor:** All you have been sheltered in

**Christopher Hooper:** a a long rest. Uh you woke up at varying levels of

**Ellis Taylor:** patience, but I cannot ignore you being

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** refreshed. Um I think

**Ellis Taylor:** I myself.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh Liliana with that 21 you you briefly hear

**Ellis Taylor:** The next time I see this dog

**Christopher Hooper:** uh just a little bit of conversation of Silus talking

**Ellis Taylor:** citizen,

**Christopher Hooper:** to someone um early on in the evening um and then uh not much else uh from him otherwise. Um but then yeah, you woke up um there, uh y'all, um saw coming in that there is like a messaul and you can smell the smells of breakfast as you wake up. Um each one of you kind of makes your way in your own style to the messaul. Um it looks like um the uh the knights have been there pretty much uh till the crack of dawn uh non-stop cooking food as people come in and out. Um and it's there you begin to see that there are people in a lot of different states of wellness. There's a lot of people um several people with uh with like burn marks and stuff. And oh, I got to take a phone call. I'll be right back.

**Ellis Taylor:** Is the hospital like part of the pub? I'm a little confused. Or is it

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, we're like underneath,

**Tyram:** Um, it seems like the the George guys have a

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Tyram:** uh their own like basement area where they do

**Ellis Taylor:** separate?

**Tyram:** stuff. I think the uh the infirmary where you guys were is down there in the basement.

Um, I'd like to brief you on um the dragon orb you've taken to Graeme Goth is a I believe your or orb's name and um we'd like to talk about next steps. I believe you're interested in the rebinding um ritual which uh we have a plan for and we'd love uh your help with that.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um I think after that I'm going to like

**Ellis Taylor:** Beautiful.

**Luke Neverisky:** kind of like scooch up to Silus and be like, "So, did you have a visitor last night? I heard you talking.

**Tyram:** Oh. Uh, no. I was uh I was trying I was making a phone call or a a stone call, I guess, would be the parlance in the setting.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, who was the uh who are you chithing with? Oh, no.

**Tyram:** But didn't you you met her, didn't you,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Oh, that she Yeah, she's cool. She's

**Luke Neverisky:** nice. So cute. So

**Tyram:** a lot to talk to her

**Ellis Taylor:** Hey, are you

**Tyram:** about. Oh, shut up.

**Ellis Taylor:** still talking to Naomi? Says Olivia. She walks in with bags of bagels and donuts.

**Tyram:** Anyway, I take a donut and I'm like,

**Ellis Taylor:** A donut boy. It makes sense. That tracks.

**Luke Neverisky:** cute.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Nothing. Nothing. I'm not

**Tyram:** "Yes, donuts are great."

**Ellis Taylor:** judging. I'm just staying at

**Justin Hale:** Wait, you guys you guys don't

**Tyram:** What?

**Justin Hale:** hear Silus talking to Naomi like every night? Sometimes he doesn't

**Ellis Taylor:** track. Just talk to her

**Justin Hale:** even call her. Sometimes he just like talks to himself. He's talking to

**Christopher Hooper:** It's

**Ellis Taylor:** to

**Luke Neverisky:** That's so

**Justin Hale:** her. Really?

**Tyram:** I mean, I I used the sending stone. What are you talking about,

**Ellis Taylor:** sleep.

**Justin Hale:** I feel like sometimes she doesn't pick up and you're just talking to

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't know what I want more stylus to be right or be right. One's really

**Tyram:** Brew?

**Ellis Taylor:** What's really funny where like they don't pick up like, "Oh, oh, hey, hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?"

**Tyram:** Who would I be trying to

**Luke Neverisky:** awesome.

**Justin Hale:** yourself.

**Tyram:** impress? Brew? Who cares about

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, sure, honey.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, it's me. I'm following

**Tyram:** that?

**Ellis Taylor:** Sure.

**Walden Briarhelm:** through.

**Tyram:** Uh well, all the people who were attracted to women in the party are just super jealous because I have clearly wanted life in that

**Ellis Taylor:** You did you did uh level up,

**Tyram:** regard. Man, I I skipped to the end of the

**Ellis Taylor:** man.


### [00:40:00]

**Luke Neverisky:** Can you see

**Tyram:** game. So yeah, I want to

**Luke Neverisky:** them?

**Tyram:** make sure I don't fumble this. So yeah, I try to talk to her as often as I

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, does Liliana or Ma uh tell them about what they heard over the evening?

**Tyram:** can. No, apparently it's all getting some details of

**Luke Neverisky:** I mean, that's that's really I'm all about that

**Tyram:** private life from Silus

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay,

**Walden Briarhelm:** It

**Justin Hale:** Spread the juice a

**Tyram:** apparently.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it uh I overheard it sounds like there's going to be some sort of a vessel going to check out where the

**Luke Neverisky:** gossip.

**Walden Briarhelm:** moon goddess fell. I am interested in

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Walden Briarhelm:** potentially finding my way uh onto the ship to go, but I do not know if I should go alone. I would want to have the

**Tyram:** Man, it's been so long since I had to care about other people's uh subests,

**Walden Briarhelm:** group. You know what? You are right. Let's continue to talk about Naomi.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, what is it?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Tyram:** man. No, no, no. When are when is when's your boat leaving

**Walden Briarhelm:** like I I believe it is supposed to be in the morning, but I do

**Tyram:** there?

**Ellis Taylor:** But I think he's

**Walden Briarhelm:** not know for sure. I I I

**Tyram:** You mean like

**Walden Briarhelm:** would have to go and check or I could ask, I

**Ellis Taylor:** alive.

**Tyram:** now? Okay. Well, we need to see what like is the dragon orb thing is

**Walden Briarhelm:** guess. I I believe we should

**Tyram:** pretty pressing, too. We need to see what the time table is on

**Walden Briarhelm:** probably focus on the impending doom of the dragon we know and wait on a new mission.

**Tyram:** that. It was like theoretically like the evil

**Ellis Taylor:** You're

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Tyram:** dragon trapped in here could like awaken at any moment.

**Ellis Taylor:** going to

**Walden Briarhelm:** I am more than understanding. It was just something I overheard. I

**Ellis Taylor:** try and

**Walden Briarhelm:** I think I'm raising interest because that means the order of St. George

**Ellis Taylor:** shoot. What happened?

**Walden Briarhelm:** is also

**Tyram:** So yeah, I mean

**Walden Briarhelm:** interested.

**Tyram:** if these guys can Okay, we've been burned before working with people who ostensibly are going to help us. So we might want to do our due diligence first. But yeah, I mean if we can work with these George guys, I'm all for

**Walden Briarhelm:** They do seem to swing quite hard. Let's

**Tyram:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh Oh, I choose my words

**Tyram:** Don't phrase it like

**Walden Briarhelm:** wisely. Uhuh.

**Tyram:** that. I I I disagree, but um Well, anyway, you know, I didn't over hear it, but did anybody I don't know why I'm even asking this. Did anybody overhear about a uh goblin village being destroyed? Because I feel like that's something that should be

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh yeah, that's right. We did we did hear

**Tyram:** brought up. Not that

**Luke Neverisky:** that. Yeah, there was one was one was kind

**Tyram:** I overheard that, but

**Luke Neverisky:** of one was not feeling so great. The other was more kind of direct about it. Matter of factly, probably just covering up. Do I see any other goblins that are not

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** brew at the breakfast

**Christopher Hooper:** go to hand

**Ellis Taylor:** What's that

**Christopher Hooper:** mech

**Luke Neverisky:** area? I perceive to a

**Christopher Hooper:** 14. Um you don't even see

**Luke Neverisky:** 14.

**Christopher Hooper:** brew.

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's beautiful.

**Luke Neverisky:** Is he out yet? He can help find other goblins, I

**Ellis Taylor:** up?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, now that you think about

**Luke Neverisky:** bet. Must still be

**Justin Hale:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** Bye-bye.

**Christopher Hooper:** it, you've never seen a brew. You've never seen a goblin up this

**Justin Hale:** was here.

**Luke Neverisky:** sleeping. Oh, well then. All right. Part for the

**Christopher Hooper:** early.

**Luke Neverisky:** course.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. And at that point, uh, you finish your breakfast. Um, you um you head down to Commander Tennol's uh Tenel's uh office and she has um all sorts of um it looks like she's taken um she has paper that has like um like rubbings of uh different things, a lot of maps, a lot of map rubbings and Um, looks like dwarven script. You see some Elvin script, some other script that you're you're not familiar with. Um, let's see. Does anyone have any like um some oddball languages they

**Luke Neverisky:** sign

**Justin Hale:** I think we all have oddball

**Christopher Hooper:** know? Um, surprisingly none of them are in sign language.

**Luke Neverisky:** language.

**Justin Hale:** languages. I know. Goblin. That's pretty

**Luke Neverisky:** Damn, that was true.

**Justin Hale:** That's pretty oddball. Even though I'm a

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm some weird one.

**Justin Hale:** goblin.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um, you do see one uh a a rubbing an aquon. Um, it it seems to say uh that it talks about um Give me a history check.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Not 20 for a before.

**Christopher Hooper:** baby. Okay. So, initially you're reading it and it seems very like like totally unrelated. It talks about um island life. um by the mountain and what you um something that you remember in your history books. There used to be um um the what your histories talk about is the shattering um the original events that uh created the um various islands in the shattered sea and and created this explosion that that broke up the continent. Um there were these people, these underwater people and uh they uh they could only write in stone um because everything else ink you know washes away. Um and so fortunately a lot of their

**Ellis Taylor:** I hope

**Christopher Hooper:** texts were were kept together and that uh was maintained in this aquon uh language and they were um from your understanding they were boiled um when the um original uh shattering event happened and most of them died. However, the ones on the other side of the continent uh remained alive for for much of the following years. Um and they were able to describe the um the original um the original dragon kin um that uh lived through that period. Um they tried to use um what you now know to be violescence um and the uh radiation that uh mutated um so many of of these people into the species you know today as humans and and gnomes and halflings. uh they all came from uh other mamalians and and these original dragon kin and um there's histories from the aquans of of kind of a transition from the the far west and uh this script is talking about this site that is happening um amongst some mountains and so uh It seems like this location uh would be close to um would be currently underwater uh but during their time it was uh like a beach but now it is completely underwater. Um, as the plates have moved, the water has um the water levels have changed. Um, ice caps have melted, water levels have risen. And so they're talking about a site that is now um well within the shattered sea off the coast of Draport. Um, and they talk about this as a a holy site of theirs.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Would would be wise enough to then realize that that could be where the moon

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** goddess This is fall.

**Christopher Hooper:** so you you see um why don't you give me an insight

**Ellis Taylor:** How about there? So, is this where we

**Christopher Hooper:** check? Actually, everyone can give me an insight check uh for

**Ellis Taylor:** see a little orb? Like, why are you telling us about a spot in the ocean,

**Christopher Hooper:** this.

**Ellis Taylor:** bud? I've lost everything.

**Justin Hale:** Insight. Damn

**Tyram:** uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Where is insight? There it is.

**Christopher Hooper:** critical 30. Jesus

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm not 20 for

**Christopher Hooper:** Christ. Okay. All right. What's your

**Ellis Taylor:** 24. 24. I'll put it in the

**Christopher Hooper:** total?

**Walden Briarhelm:** But guys,

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** chat.

**Christopher Hooper:** 24. Okay. Okay. Good. All right. Excellent.

**Walden Briarhelm:** sorry.

**Tyram:** 20. Damn, I came in third place with a 20.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we're very insightful after a nice good a good night's sleep

**Walden Briarhelm:** Dang.

**Tyram:** s***.

**Ellis Taylor:** and some muff or bagels and donuts.


### [00:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Excellent. Okay. So, um I'm going to lay out the information and basically this is like going to be pingponging across all the party members as they're like, "Oh, yes, and that and that." And then like it's all coming together. You um the reason why that's relevant, you now see throughout the other documents, what they're trying to track down is this ritual site. This ritual site was originally defined as a holy site from the Aquans um deep in in what is now completely underwater. Aquon was a name applied to them afterwards because their carvings were in places that were underwater, but they weren't underwater when they were originally founded. Um, and what you're seeing in all these connections is that first the aquite and it's a holy site because there is a strong metaphysical connection to um different different civilizations have called it different things. Um, the Aquans called it um a a um rift site within their religion. The dwarves called it a place of balancing. Um so a place where you could adjust the balance of your reality. Um and there's a most of the uh writings uh the more elaborate writings are in that dwarven about this site and what you see um even more recent human writings and most recent writings have been steering it. It seems like um raw facts. It seems like the uh Luna fell right around here. The theories that you're seeing on the wall are that something about this was able to anchor um Luna to this place as almost a like soft landing for her. The only reason she didn't completely shatter herself and the rest of the planet causing it to go into a complete meltdown of the you know the whole like boiling of the ocean like covering of the world into like a a complete winter was something about this place stabilized her fall. Um you're seeing that um there are reports of basically this hole in the ocean um where all the coral has been exposed to the air. Um it's still being maintained but it's completely dry there. people are able to walk along the body of Luna and since then they have uh originally there was an expediition uh that was sent there to try to study it and then dragons have since been uh doing pass destroying basically anyone they found in the area. Um, handing it off to you all as you think about this and as you connect these pieces

**Tyram:** Man, this is a lot to digest, guys. Um, so, okay. So, yeah, it looks like we found your your

**Christopher Hooper:** together. Oh.

**Tyram:** moon goddess there, Ma.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, should I tell you about what we've found?

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, so much information. Yeah, sure. Let's see if

**Christopher Hooper:** Right.

**Luke Neverisky:** we get

**Christopher Hooper:** So, um, well, there's a lot to catch you up on.

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, can any of you read any of these, uh, artifacts on the wall? Uh, this is Commander Tendelle's speaking as, uh, you you've entered her office.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. I was looking at

**Christopher Hooper:** you know

**Walden Briarhelm:** the old aquon stones over here and the stone. Oh, yes. It's uh one of the few languages I

**Christopher Hooper:** Equ. No, I uh we were only able to know this was relevant recently when a uh another toral came to join us. Uh do you know

**Tyram:** I uh put my hand over your shoulder

**Christopher Hooper:** Rafael?

**Tyram:** now. Now, Brew, we can't hold it against these people who aren't the world's greatest

**Justin Hale:** Oh. Yeah, that's there. All right. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** Did you say Raphael? You've seen

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** detectives.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. Yes. He's he's um he's leading our

**Walden Briarhelm:** him.

**Christopher Hooper:** site and rebind the dragon within the orb. Make sure that it's maintained, but uh there's more to it. We're afraid that there's more than one orb, one that we haven't been able to track. We think by instrumenting around the rebinding ritual, we're able to get a signal to the other orbs and find

**Luke Neverisky:** gone.

**Ellis Taylor:** quick.

**Christopher Hooper:** them. Find how many there are and find where

**Ellis Taylor:** Dragon

**Christopher Hooper:** they might be

**Justin Hale:** Wait. So

**Tyram:** Well, you were right to call in the world's greatest detectives to help

**Christopher Hooper:** directionally.

**Tyram:** you find these things. We shouldn't be able to get to the bottom of this

**Ellis Taylor:** Ball. Do we get a wish at the end of

**Christopher Hooper:** Um if

**Ellis Taylor:** this?

**Christopher Hooper:** your wish is to bind the strongest

**Justin Hale:** different.

**Tyram:** case.

**Christopher Hooper:** um minor god uh in our realm then then yes that is my

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** mean, I guess that's

**Tyram:** Is that just one of several options though or is that like the only wish it

**Christopher Hooper:** wish.

**Luke Neverisky:** okay. What about like fame?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Luke Neverisky:** Like musical

**Christopher Hooper:** um I don't think directly, but we can work with that if that's what you

**Luke Neverisky:** fame?

**Walden Briarhelm:** So is a is a group like

**Tyram:** grants?

**Ellis Taylor:** Do I get

**Walden Briarhelm:** using the uh the silus switch mental thing.

**Ellis Taylor:** a floating cloud? Just

**Christopher Hooper:** need.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh no. Go

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Sorry. All right. Can I do I get a floating cloud? It would be really nice for my

**Walden Briarhelm:** ahead.

**Tyram:** Oh, what about like a pole that like gets

**Ellis Taylor:** sciatica. Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I want a green friend. I

**Ellis Taylor:** get

**Walden Briarhelm:** already have one. This

**Luke Neverisky:** You have a new

**Tyram:** longer? You don't even wish for that. You are a green person. You know a lot of green people. Brew is

**Walden Briarhelm:** brew.

**Justin Hale:** I

**Tyram:** green. Brew, did you not know you

**Ellis Taylor:** tails.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Who? Who is

**Justin Hale:** am. I'm definitely

**Tyram:** were green this whole

**Walden Briarhelm:** this? Oh.

**Luke Neverisky:** No, not what you're made of on the inside like your skull color your

**Justin Hale:** brown. Brew is actually

**Tyram:** time? Okay, because

**Ellis Taylor:** Brew, are you color

**Luke Neverisky:** skin.

**Justin Hale:** green.

**Tyram:** I I actually was a little confused for a second. I've been picturing

**Ellis Taylor:** blind? Olivia's going to pull out something red and something green

**Tyram:** brew wrong this whole

**Ellis Taylor:** from her pockets. Hey, bud. What colors are

**Tyram:** time.

**Ellis Taylor:** these? Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. Well, now

**Justin Hale:** They're brown

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Well, now we know. I'm writing it in my

**Luke Neverisky:** we know who's going

**Justin Hale:** obviously. Oh,

**Tyram:** Brute,

**Ellis Taylor:** notes.

**Justin Hale:** what? What? What are you talking

**Tyram:** do you eat so much brown that you can only see the color

**Justin Hale:** about? There's only two colors that exist. Different shades of brown and

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** to

**Justin Hale:** blue.

**Tyram:** brown? How did blue make the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait.

**Justin Hale:** I don't What do you mean? That's what everybody sees.

**Tyram:** cut?

**Justin Hale:** Brown, a little bit of like a yellowy color and and

**Ellis Taylor:** honey. Oh, honey. Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** So, it's going to tell

**Tyram:** R. There's There's

**Ellis Taylor:** honey. There's a lot of

**Luke Neverisky:** them. All right,

**Justin Hale:** blue. Oh,

**Tyram:** several more colors than

**Ellis Taylor:** colors. Alice, you need to start working on this. You remember

**Justin Hale:** there's

**Tyram:** that. I make one of my daggers like Okay. So, like this is

**Justin Hale:** not.

**Tyram:** purple. This This dagger, it's

**Ellis Taylor:** your

**Luke Neverisky:** that's

**Justin Hale:** What? That is

**Tyram:** it's the color purple. Does it look like blue to you? I'm

**Justin Hale:** a blue. That is the bluest ne I've ever seen in my

**Tyram:** curious.

**Luke Neverisky:** Is is Bruce f****** like with a silus or

**Justin Hale:** life. He's actually color blind. That's a

**Tyram:** He's blue, brown, color blind,

**Justin Hale:** dertinopia if I if I have those

**Luke Neverisky:** assistant?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Blue

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** correct. But if you have proteinopia, you got

**Tyram:** which Oh, s***.

**Ellis Taylor:** be difficult to

**Christopher Hooper:** Well,

**Walden Briarhelm:** B.

**Justin Hale:** worse

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** um I I don't know about those, but

**Ellis Taylor:** chat.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm I'm sure we can figure those out with our resources. I don't I


### [01:00:00]

**Justin Hale:** problem.

**Christopher Hooper:** don't I'm not really sure.

**Tyram:** Sorry, we kind of

**Walden Briarhelm:** So yeah. So piecing

**Justin Hale:** Life is real. Move

**Tyram:** lost the thread there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** this together then it sounded like from the aquon stone there was a at some point in the past a religious

**Tyram:** Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** site of some sort but over time it has been drowned. It is now

**Ellis Taylor:** between

**Walden Briarhelm:** underwater and that's where Luna fell and found like

**Justin Hale:** on.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a soft landing spot so that she didn't herself break into a million pieces or cause carnage. But now we're finding out that site isn't just a nice soft landing spot for moon gods. It's also just like a religious maybe spiritual hot spot. And they're suggesting that by taking the orb there, we will be able to somehow signal to what we've learned about another collection of orbs

**Justin Hale:** That was

**Walden Briarhelm:** that we should be collecting. But also there are dragons protecting the site.

**Justin Hale:** fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, uh, that's mostly correct. Um, one correction is that uh we will still need to redo the rebinding ritual. We believe that the rebinding ritual will um create uh some sort of metaphysical linkage with the other orbs and we will have some um some instrumentation that is able to read those signals um that are spewed out during the ritual. you'll still need to do the ritual. Our plan is to support you by distracting and hopefully eliminating the dragons that are um patrolling and uh interfering with the site.

**Tyram:** Okay, so we need to go collect all of the Worvin

**Ellis Taylor:** need to worry about bringing them all together in one

**Tyram:** orbs or worm orbs. I'm trying to think of what we should say instead of dragon

**Walden Briarhelm:** Is there any like specific marking on them that they

**Luke Neverisky:** Don't you like the

**Tyram:** balls.

**Ellis Taylor:** place. What color

**Walden Briarhelm:** all have? But

**Luke Neverisky:** stairs?

**Tyram:** Have we had the fourstar worm orb

**Ellis Taylor:** was

**Justin Hale:** Thank

**Tyram:** the whole

**Ellis Taylor:** purple?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um um it's like purple and and

**Walden Briarhelm:** like I like worm

**Christopher Hooper:** black. No stars. Not that

**Walden Briarhelm:** orb. Damn.

**Tyram:** time?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Maybe it's maybe they're not activated yet and they need

**Luke Neverisky:** Damn

**Tyram:** Ow.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to be like brought together to have a a ritual

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** easy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that brings the symbol to

**Luke Neverisky:** There's

**Walden Briarhelm:** life. Like if this was like Moonfall GT, that might be

**Christopher Hooper:** Another thing, as you may

**Walden Briarhelm:** how it would go

**Christopher Hooper:** have noticed, when you entered, we scanned you all for any sort of um enchantment magic. one of

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I

**Christopher Hooper:** the most

**Walden Briarhelm:** down.

**Luke Neverisky:** hope.

**Justin Hale:** didn't I didn't consent to

**Christopher Hooper:** um when you were putting all your magic items in the the tray and then it went through the

**Justin Hale:** that. Oh, the beep thing. Oh, all

**Christopher Hooper:** scanner.

**Justin Hale:** right. All right, that's fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Well, the reason why is we are led to understand that the orbs have a strong level of influence of those around them. um they will try to promise you things or or influence you in in such a way uh as to towards their ends often in a nonobvious way. And so I'm quite frankly surprised you were able under your own will to bring it towards us. Um quite a statement of your own um character and

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that that's definitely never happened, right? Silence.

**Tyram:** We're just really good guys, I guess, you

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, the best the goodest of

**Tyram:** know.

**Christopher Hooper:** mean objectively you must be very strong of of

**Justin Hale:** guys. So, 100%. We we've we've been we've been told

**Ellis Taylor:** I think the word

**Justin Hale:** that multiple times. We're like the williest

**Ellis Taylor:** you're looking for is pigheaded, but we get to go with

**Christopher Hooper:** will.

**Ellis Taylor:** strong.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm trying to be diplomatic and I'm very grateful for for you bringing it here. If only we've wasted so much time at

**Ellis Taylor:** What's going

**Christopher Hooper:** poor Sander that the whole reason we had him at that bakery

**Justin Hale:** people.

**Christopher Hooper:** was to bring out this orb. We were hoping that he would be targeted and sure enough he was. And I can't believe

**Ellis Taylor:** on? You

**Christopher Hooper:** it actually worked to

**Ellis Taylor:** used him as

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Tyram:** Yeah, let's circle back to that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Let's

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, that's

**Tyram:** Um, he could have died

**Christopher Hooper:** only Yeah. Yep.

**Tyram:** if we weren't

**Ellis Taylor:** bait.

**Christopher Hooper:** It was really our last option. We were We really had no

**Tyram:** there.

**Christopher Hooper:** idea where it

**Luke Neverisky:** okay.

**Tyram:** The iron claws didn't even have the orb and you guys just put them in like the the crosshairs for no

**Christopher Hooper:** went. it. Our best information was they

**Luke Neverisky:** Do you know

**Tyram:** reason. Okay. By

**Ellis Taylor:** Does

**Christopher Hooper:** did.

**Tyram:** the way, I wanted to ask a little bit more about that. Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** Sander consent to being

**Luke Neverisky:** anything? That's what I'm

**Tyram:** how do the iron claws fit into all

**Ellis Taylor:** bait?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I don't know.

**Luke Neverisky:** wondering.

**Tyram:** this?

**Christopher Hooper:** I That's what we've been trying to figure out. I mean, we assumed they were under the thr of the orb and deep in Legion of the the dragon. Um, well, we call her Astro the Dragon Queen, but I don't know. Uh, I think she has many

**Tyram:** her real name is way too long for me to remember, so there's actually no danger of me saying it. Um

**Christopher Hooper:** names. Well, Astro,

**Tyram:** but

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, we assumed that she was really the one orchestrating the Iron Claws and their work in High Forge. uh we assumed under the effects of the orb. Um the fact that you've had it makes things very confusing. Um and I'm not sure quite sure how to

**Tyram:** um

**Christopher Hooper:** how to connect the dots there yet. We definitely have to go back to the drawing board and see how they fit into this. Is there anything you've come up with in in your study so

**Tyram:** Um, I guess uh Hey bro, we still got all those journals. Okay. Uh, I start like Oh, right. I I open up the pee hole and um we start uh taking out all the journals that we

**Christopher Hooper:** far? Oh, wait. Whose

**Tyram:** collected.

**Christopher Hooper:** journals are these?

**Justin Hale:** Maybe.

**Tyram:** These are uh Heldra's journals.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh my

**Tyram:** It's how we actually knew that Hersander might still be alive, so why we came back here. And now we uh there might be something in here that we missed. Unlikely since we are in fact the world's greatest detectives, but you know, just

**Christopher Hooper:** god. Holy s***. Where did you find

**Tyram:** might as well have you guys peruse them as well. What part of world's greatest

**Christopher Hooper:** these?

**Tyram:** detective was was ambiguous there?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, this is great. Oh my god. Okay, this this could help it

**Tyram:** We're

**Christopher Hooper:** a lot.

**Tyram:** just great at finding things even when we don't actively think about looking for

**Ellis Taylor:** just surrounded by Hufflepuffs is what it

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, well, that's

**Tyram:** them. Look, jealousy is a bad

**Ellis Taylor:** is.

**Justin Hale:** What the

**Tyram:** look, Liv. I'm just going to say

**Ellis Taylor:** I have to put something on Discord for

**Christopher Hooper:** great. All right. Well,

**Ellis Taylor:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** um I think um Bafael was planning to

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** get a ship and head out pretty soon. Uh, do you have any other questions

**Justin Hale:** hell?

**Christopher Hooper:** before for before for me before heading there? Nope. Good. All right.

**Luke Neverisky:** What's

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, um, and,

**Ellis Taylor:** What's

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, don't think we'll be, uh, taking this work lightly. Um, we'll have a substantial reward when you come if you come back

**Luke Neverisky:** that?

**Christopher Hooper:** successful. Even if you don't uh if you get any critical information or or you know take down a dragon or

**Ellis Taylor:** up,

**Christopher Hooper:** two, we know how to process them and and make a lot of money from them. So, uh do what you can and uh please come back

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, something I did want to run by you though, like

**Christopher Hooper:** safe.

**Tyram:** maybe from when we get back, if uh the Ironclaw is here in Greyport, if they have more information, you know, maybe uh maybe we could take them down and uh destroy them and all of the Utgard family, you know, just, you know, just while we're at

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, sure. That sounds great. If you want, we can have their

**Tyram:** it. So, yeah, let's

**Christopher Hooper:** Sander back at the bakery as a honeypot

**Tyram:** go. Maybe a different plan this time, but

**Christopher Hooper:** again.

**Tyram:** um is that went catastrophically wrong before, you

**Christopher Hooper:** It did work

**Tyram:** know, by sheer happen

**Christopher Hooper:** though. All right. Well, I'm open to

**Tyram:** stance. Okay. Oh, is Sander still here? I actually I wouldn't mind talking to him for a

**Christopher Hooper:** ideas. Yeah. I think he's still arresting in the medical

**Tyram:** bit.

**Luke Neverisky:** Did um did their set know he was being a

**Christopher Hooper:** ward. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** decoy? Do you know he's being bait? Okay. Well, that's good at least. Okay. Never mind

**Ellis Taylor:** As long as you had consent,

**Luke Neverisky:** then.

**Tyram:** Okay. That

**Ellis Taylor:** that's okay. Still don't agree with

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. This


### [01:10:00]

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh it's

**Christopher Hooper:** establishment is all about defining consent.

**Ellis Taylor:** your need to add that to your lyrics,

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm sure you found that in the main

**Tyram:** is

**Ellis Taylor:** bud, but just um Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** hall.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Before we go, do you have anything in your armory that we could potentially use for

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** this

**Christopher Hooper:** absolutely. Um, it should be down the hall. Please take a look uh if you need it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** adventure?

**Luke Neverisky:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** Has um plenty sets of uh plate or anything you need. So, yeah. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hey. Uh, Brew, you should go to the armory and find anything apparently that you could use for, you know, any of your antics. A spear bomb, perhaps. Whatever plate is in the form of a bomb.

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Walden Briarhelm:** Maybe a weapon bomb. Any bombs.

**Ellis Taylor:** can't sleeping.

**Justin Hale:** I don't dislike the sound of

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, I I have been learning and paying attention. Bombs are what you

**Luke Neverisky:** Oops.

**Justin Hale:** that. Would anyone like to come with me

**Walden Briarhelm:** like. I will join you as I asked. And

**Justin Hale:** for carrying

**Walden Briarhelm:** I love to carry heavy things. It is kind of my

**Justin Hale:** purposes?

**Tyram:** Well, do you do you want to come with me

**Justin Hale:** All right.

**Tyram:** to talk to Tander first? I thought that would be, you know, maybe

**Walden Briarhelm:** thing. I will I will wait for

**Justin Hale:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** a Yeah. a nice RP moment. Not that I'm sure I know what that

**Walden Briarhelm:** you at the honory. Go with sex.

**Justin Hale:** sure. Almost almost taunting me with bombs. I kind of

**Tyram:** is. Fair enough.

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. Um, so you two head to the the medical

**Justin Hale:** forgot.

**Christopher Hooper:** ward. You find there Sander there. Um, he's just woken up. He has a tray of uh oatmeal and apple juice. And um as you walk in, he says, "Hey, hey

**Justin Hale:** I immediately jump and start

**Christopher Hooper:** guys.

**Justin Hale:** strangling him. I didn't I left you in bed this whole time. Never do this to me

**Tyram:** Bro teeth.

**Justin Hale:** again. I just start yelling at him like a mom.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, I'm

**Tyram:** Down, down. I get out

**Christopher Hooper:** sorry.

**Justin Hale:** All

**Tyram:** like a spray bottle and start

**Justin Hale:** right, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Get off me. I give it like a second and then I

**Christopher Hooper:** I thought y'all were

**Justin Hale:** jump back on

**Christopher Hooper:** dead. I thought y'all were dead. I thought y'all were dead, too.

**Tyram:** spraying.

**Christopher Hooper:** I didn't And like y'all don't have y'all never gave me an address or anything, so I didn't know where to send

**Justin Hale:** him.

**Tyram:** We we thought you were dead.

**Christopher Hooper:** your condolences.

**Tyram:** We didn't like we didn't think there was anyone to leave a forward address

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, but I just I had

**Tyram:** for, you

**Christopher Hooper:** PO boxes for everyone else that I sent their sent messages to just to be like I miss you, but I didn't know. I'm

**Tyram:** know.

**Christopher Hooper:** sorry. Hey, that last job

**Tyram:** Hey, good to see you

**Christopher Hooper:** was crazy.

**Tyram:** both. Yeah, it it was going pretty well until it went catastrophically wrong in the worst way

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** possible. How what happened? How did you

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I They stabbed me, but uh

**Tyram:** survive?

**Christopher Hooper:** they never I just blacked out and eventually I don't think they ever checked to make sure I was actually dead. I crawled my way. When I woke up, my dead sister was next to me and I crawled out of there into a local coffee shop where there was a beautiful man and he healed me. And he told me, "You're gonna use this sacrifice to change the world, and you're going to hunt down dragons." And that's what I did.

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Tyram:** Who is the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. Never saw him

**Tyram:** guy? Wow, that is

**Christopher Hooper:** again.

**Luke Neverisky:** Some person.

**Justin Hale:** Maybe it's a little

**Tyram:** a Yeah, that is a pretty ominous encounter, I gotta say. Oh yeah, just it's a strange thing to say to someone.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I don't know if that's exactly what it said. I was

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** ominous.

**Christopher Hooper:** pretty almost

**Tyram:** Yes. Well, we we certainly thought you were

**Christopher Hooper:** dead. How did you guys get

**Tyram:** dead. I'm genuinely shocked that you

**Christopher Hooper:** out?

**Justin Hale:** with

**Tyram:** survived. Um we jumped into a storm train. You know, one of the one of those perks of being a a small folk, you

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that's

**Justin Hale:** our

**Tyram:** know. And yeah,

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Tyram:** we thought the rest of you were dead, so we just uh got the hell out of town. Thought we'd try to, you know, lay low, assume new ident. Oh, I go by Silus

**Christopher Hooper:** smart. Oh,

**Tyram:** nowadays, by the way.

**Christopher Hooper:** really? Earl such a good name

**Tyram:** Yeah. Well, you know, I didn't Bleby was uh who they would be looking for. So, I thought, okay, I'll I'll switch over to a new name, but it didn't work. They they

**Christopher Hooper:** though.

**Tyram:** actually caught up to us in High

**Christopher Hooper:** What do you go by now, Brew? Oh, yeah. They'll never think about that. Oh,

**Justin Hale:** Brew. I spell it differently

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. with a

**Justin Hale:** though. No, it's

**Tyram:** Forge.

**Christopher Hooper:** a dang

**Justin Hale:** spelled the same. I lied.

**Tyram:** But well anyway, they did catch up to us and uh we had to we fled from High Forge for a little while. But believe it or not, we actually ended up working with a bunch of goody two shoe types. You know, people who like to, you know,

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Tyram:** save cities and all that like heroic

**Justin Hale:** It's really

**Tyram:** crap. It is very

**Christopher Hooper:** Do you make a lot of

**Justin Hale:** exhausting. Not as much

**Tyram:** exhausting.

**Justin Hale:** as we

**Tyram:** Oh, absolutely not. Like this is hero work

**Justin Hale:** should.

**Tyram:** is a mugs game. It doesn't pay well enough at

**Christopher Hooper:** money? You're probably poppers now,

**Tyram:** all. But well, you

**Christopher Hooper:** huh?

**Tyram:** know, there's some upsides to it because it did give us the chance to uh we actually confronted Ela and we

**Christopher Hooper:** You killed

**Tyram:** did it. We killed her. We killed her.

**Christopher Hooper:** her. That's

**Tyram:** She's super dead.

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Did you um did you say something

**Justin Hale:** She's cool. She killed everyone that we knew and all you have to say is that's

**Tyram:** Oh, it was sick as

**Christopher Hooper:** cool? Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** man. Yeah. I don't know what the else to say other than well she had it coming but also

**Tyram:** hell. Is she

**Christopher Hooper:** like I don't know I don't know if anyone

**Tyram:** dead?

**Christopher Hooper:** deserves to

**Justin Hale:** She She

**Tyram:** She

**Christopher Hooper:** die. Well, all right

**Justin Hale:** definitively

**Christopher Hooper:** then. Cool.

**Tyram:** did. But yeah, I mean, but now apparently

**Justin Hale:** did.

**Tyram:** uh there's the rest of the family tree that we got to deal with now. Her mom's still running things here. So, I guess uh I don't know. Maybe the uh the revenge tour isn't quite as over as I thought it

**Christopher Hooper:** I gotta tell you, they're not as Helra's bold. They're uh they're not like a a gang here like they were in High Forge. They're something something deeper.

**Justin Hale:** What do you

**Tyram:** was. Oh, they they blew up that bakery where you were working.

**Luke Neverisky:** There's that.

**Christopher Hooper:** After months, months of

**Justin Hale:** mean?

**Christopher Hooper:** nothing, months of I I've worked at that bakery. I I was the night manager. I've been there for a long time. Worked my way up. I've got a 401k there now. Really good benefits. Full-time employee.

**Tyram:** Hey, I'm glad for you. I am

**Christopher Hooper:** And uh and out of nowhere they blow the whole f****** thing up. Not like a I mean it's not like a stealthy assassination. It's a you know orchestrated signal to anyone.

**Justin Hale:** I mean, you've been there for months. Do you have any any reason or clue of why they would want to do

**Christopher Hooper:** everyone. I think they were waiting for something for

**Justin Hale:** that?

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** some signal or something to change. Maybe because of y'all. I mean, y'all y'all made a big change for them, right? You killed Helga. That mean that'll cause a shift.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, but that was that uh that was x amount of time

**Tyram:** like a like a month ago.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. It was x amount of time

**Justin Hale:** ago.

**Tyram:** Well, if they're doing stuff

**Christopher Hooper:** ago.

**Tyram:** now, um I mean, hell, even if they weren't doing stuff now, I'd still want to take them


### [01:20:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, I think what you got is exactly what we needed. Them coming out, coming out of hiding, show them what they got. We got a hostage. We can start start there. Uh

**Tyram:** down.

**Christopher Hooper:** I know um a few of them, they get their postmortem crew out and do some speak with that and stuff and work with the get some stuff out of their soldiers. So hopefully we can find some more things out. But uh this is exactly what we needed. A little a little catalyst to get the wheels moving. It's tough. It's

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. All right. Well, let's let's get you checked out of here and you can crash with me and me and Silus for now and until we get you into a normal place, but then yeah, we get the band back together,

**Christopher Hooper:** tough. Oh. Oh.

**Justin Hale:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** But I guess I mean I've got a pretty good place here. Um but if y'all got something going. Yeah, we could totally do that. Yeah, I'm ready to run some more missions. I've got a few leads that I've got through the bakery. Um there's like this like whole flower network I've been figuring out. Um there's some real money to be made there. So if y'all are like scam for cash, like I can we got some business going

**Tyram:** I'm sorry.

**Christopher Hooper:** on.

**Tyram:** Are you offering us job in the baked goods industry right

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, no. It's It's bigger than that. Flour.

**Tyram:** now?

**Luke Neverisky:** could

**Christopher Hooper:** Processed flour. High gluten

**Luke Neverisky:** be

**Tyram:** None of what you said makes me think you're not offering us a job

**Christopher Hooper:** here. Well, I

**Tyram:** in the baked goods

**Luke Neverisky:** nice. I don't know. I wouldn't I would turn them

**Christopher Hooper:** mean, it's

**Luke Neverisky:** down. It seems kind of nice. Make some cooking

**Christopher Hooper:** not a job in the baked goods business.

**Luke Neverisky:** some

**Christopher Hooper:** It's the job. The big

**Luke Neverisky:** biscus.

**Christopher Hooper:** job. The big dough payday. You know

**Tyram:** industry.

**Christopher Hooper:** what I'm talking

**Justin Hale:** No, we

**Luke Neverisky:** There you

**Christopher Hooper:** about.

**Justin Hale:** literally don't know what you're talking about.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, listen. I've got it coming together. You come back to me when you're ready for it. We're gonna crack it wide open.

**Justin Hale:** Did you Did you hit your head super hard when

**Luke Neverisky:** go.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Tyram:** gives you advantage on uh like initiative roles and things like

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** Should I be holding

**Tyram:** that. Oh, and I think perception checks too.

**Ellis Taylor:** really?

**Christopher Hooper:** Did you

**Justin Hale:** shield?

**Tyram:** Say

**Justin Hale:** Uh, I'm saying should I be holding a

**Tyram:** what? There's nothing stopping

**Justin Hale:** shield?

**Tyram:** you. Artificers get

**Ellis Taylor:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** what? It'll get rid of your stealth advantage probably.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** shields. I don't think shields affect

**Justin Hale:** You're a stealth

**Christopher Hooper:** Take it back. Take it

**Justin Hale:** advantage. Got

**Tyram:** that.

**Luke Neverisky:** Got him.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'd rather I think

**Christopher Hooper:** um that crashed there during uh prior war. Um the so there's a couple routes you could go by there or you could specifically not go by there. Um along uh on the way to the uh to the harbor where Bafael is likely looking for a boat. Um, and yeah. Which way are you

**Tyram:** Uh, okay. Hey, let me uh let me do a a side chat with Brew here real quick. Um, do we want to go scope out the this cogen steam now or should we wait until we get

**Christopher Hooper:** going?

**Justin Hale:** Uh maybe we should wait till we get

**Tyram:** back?

**Justin Hale:** back.

**Tyram:** Yeah. I don't want to go in like unprepared, you

**Ellis Taylor:** Aren't we on like a time crunch to catch this boat

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** know. We're on a

**Ellis Taylor:** anyway?

**Tyram:** time crunch to catch the boat. Yeah. I mean, we were having a side conversation. That was a little rude of you,

**Ellis Taylor:** right here. I don't know what you're trying to

**Justin Hale:** We didn't say all detectives were in this

**Tyram:** but sorry, you have to be a a rank S detective to be part of this conversation.

**Ellis Taylor:** do. Good

**Tyram:** Rank

**Ellis Taylor:** lord.

**Christopher Hooper:** She is

**Walden Briarhelm:** you. Yeah, you can't be retired

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** Didn't we just establish she's been retired for

**Christopher Hooper:** retired.

**Justin Hale:** this you'll Get better one day, Olivia.

**Tyram:** A's

**Ellis Taylor:** like a well I guess a month at the beginning of the campaign but yeah I don't know how long it's

**Christopher Hooper:** recently retired detective Olivia

**Walden Briarhelm:** basically.

**Tyram:** How many um how much time has

**Ellis Taylor:** been.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cooper.

**Tyram:** passed in game at this? Has it been a

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah about you

**Tyram:** year?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** know I like tried to follow our

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** actual calendar to a certain extent with catchup

**Tyram:** That makes sense. We have had some

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Tyram:** time with some in like a vaguely defined

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** downtime which I guess could be any amount of time we want it to

**Christopher Hooper:** periods and like um interdimensional time that allows does time skip. Um, all right. So, um, y'all are specifically not going by the

**Tyram:** be.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** cog and steam. You head towards

**Tyram:** Yeah, we'll we'll poke that for

**Justin Hale:** We'll put a pin in that

**Tyram:** its nest

**Luke Neverisky:** Could have been as

**Christopher Hooper:** the and you head towards the dock. Ma,

**Luke Neverisky:** Hey.

**Christopher Hooper:** you see um very prominently um your toal brothers s surrounded by um these dragon knights. And

**Justin Hale:** one.

**Tyram:** later.


### [01:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** uh he is kitted out in like a um he's actually kitted out in his u monk robes. Um but all of the knights around him, uh there's a there's another commander there that has um dragon um a bone wings uh coming from his uh back and a huge uh great sword uh scabbard in it uh along with um decorated uh bone white armor as they all do. Um, and they are currently talking to uh what appears to be a captain near a bunk uh near a uh a a boat plank. Um, and you see that there are a few hierlings that are moving gear onto that boat as they're um talking. Um, and as you get closer, you start to hear some of this conversation saying, "What do you think is a fair price for my party and I to make an expedition on your boat?" Hey, well, um, we'll take you out there. Uh, you say it's should be a clean ride there. Are we looking for trouble? You You seem pretty armored up. There will be trouble. There will be dragons. Okay. Well, uh I don't know about some dragons. Uh I'm just a fishing vessel, but uh we can take you pretty close. I will have aid. We will take care of the dragons. You will have no problem with them. Okay. And and you said I didn't really have a choice about this, right? That is right. You have no choice but we will pay you for your time. All right. Well, I will all be Brodex. Make yourself at home then. Thank you, Captain Buckle. Thank you, Mr. Raphael, sir. Uh, and um you then see that that's the end of the conversation. The captain moves on to the boat and um you see Bafael start talking to the other um knights and commander um as they organize the the different gear going on aboard. Um as you approach and um yeah um anything how are you approaching

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, first

**Christopher Hooper:** this?

**Walden Briarhelm:** via Silus's uh, network. I'd like to make sure everybody else heard this if they didn't because it sounds like I was just approaching and overheard. So, letting them know the guy I know, Raphael, my my monk brother, he seems like he's in charge. So, we are going to like that a lot. Um, they're going to be paying to be on this vessel. And, uh, I I I I say we should uh volunteer to join to help protect the ship. But then before I say it, I think uh to Sil or like Silas, we should should should we do a thing where we ask the captain if we could protect the boat for a cut of the money? Is that a good

**Tyram:** I mean, yeah, we could hire ourselves out as

**Walden Briarhelm:** idea? Yes. Yes. I was taking in consideration of the other members of my party. Uh

**Tyram:** guards.

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, is there a reason Papel can't know what we're

**Walden Briarhelm:** so oh it's just a yeah it's just to

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. Isn't he your

**Walden Briarhelm:** make money by saying like talking to the captain. It's just an opportunity to make

**Ellis Taylor:** doing? Oh, okay. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** money is all

**Luke Neverisky:** brother?

**Ellis Taylor:** was making sure I didn't miss something that we are hiding what we were

**Walden Briarhelm:** capitalizing. I I think the gang's

**Tyram:** I'm proud of

**Ellis Taylor:** doing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** rubbing off on me a little bit here. I don't know what's going on.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, honey, you're getting you're losing your innocence here a little

**Tyram:** you. Inside of this party, there are two wolves. There are the heroic ones and then there are

**Justin Hale:** Awesome.

**Tyram:** the the ones who are always looking for an opportunity

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, this is great. So, uh, no, at

**Tyram:** for cash

**Walden Briarhelm:** this point I assume would, uh, walk up,

**Ellis Taylor:** bit.

**Walden Briarhelm:** but Raphael growing up in the monastery, we're going to say he was kind of a He was like the prankster, so he always had a

**Tyram:** advancement. I thought this guy's name was

**Walden Briarhelm:** rap. Oh. Oh, I am so sorry. Bafo. Well, uh, he was always kind of the prankster, so everybody called him Rap Sheet. So, I'm going to welcome him be like, "Hey, Rap Sheet, is that you?" And, uh, I'm imagining there's already a glimmer in his eye because, uh, he only

**Tyram:** Bafel.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Walden Briarhelm:** so few people would know to call him that.

**Christopher Hooper:** What are you doing

**Walden Briarhelm:** I uh I could be asking you the same. Did I overhear that correctly? Are you in charge of

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Oh, of

**Walden Briarhelm:** these

**Christopher Hooper:** course. This was my

**Walden Briarhelm:** men?

**Christopher Hooper:** scheme.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, so you also know of where Luna has

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes, I do not go for this

**Walden Briarhelm:** fallen.

**Christopher Hooper:** dragon thing that they are concerned. I hope to find our

**Walden Briarhelm:** I uh I have a gang

**Christopher Hooper:** god

**Walden Briarhelm:** with me and I believe that we should join you. We

**Christopher Hooper:** again. I have influenced you well.

**Walden Briarhelm:** will we will all join you and help protect the ship. I agree that Luna is very important, but there is a calamity coming with these worm orbs that we must take care of. We should treat it with very great

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm sure you can take care, but are your

**Walden Briarhelm:** seriousness.

**Christopher Hooper:** friends ready for what lies ahead?

**Walden Briarhelm:** You know how admirable our talents are as fighters, but these people are just as skilled, if not more skilled than we are. They will hold their own. Even the cute girl with the uh ukulele, she's

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm standing on my tippy toes like giving some

**Walden Briarhelm:** ravaging. Yeah.

**Tyram:** How tall or short

**Luke Neverisky:** overenthusiastic

**Tyram:** is

**Luke Neverisky:** wave. That's a great question

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Thank

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Just

**Luke Neverisky:** actually. I think I wrote that down. Um I think she's

**Christopher Hooper:** you.

**Luke Neverisky:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** Five 54

**Tyram:** Liliana?

**Luke Neverisky:** no normal human height

**Ellis Taylor:** You mean

**Christopher Hooper:** 55.

**Luke Neverisky:** probably something like that

**Ellis Taylor:** average?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Average human

**Walden Briarhelm:** right.

**Tyram:** I don't know. It sounds pretty

**Ellis Taylor:** Average? No, it's perfectly

**Tyram:** short. I'm pretty sure

**Ellis Taylor:** average.

**Tyram:** it's like freakishly

**Luke Neverisky:** average hang I wrote this down because I think I didn't write that in the honest

**Christopher Hooper:** woman.

**Walden Briarhelm:** How tall is Jewel? Just like I was type in real

**Tyram:** short.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Oh, she

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, she's a tall

**Tyram:** height.

**Christopher Hooper:** female.

**Luke Neverisky:** 5'8. Yes. Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool

**Christopher Hooper:** These

**Luke Neverisky:** Fellow whman, what is height?

**Christopher Hooper:** humans. How tall are

**Walden Briarhelm:** on. How do you do, little oxygen

**Tyram:** You're probably on like

**Ellis Taylor:** man.

**Walden Briarhelm:** breather?

**Tyram:** a like a wa like a an NSA like watch list now for

**Christopher Hooper:** they?

**Tyram:** like trying to watch out for like infiltrating aliens or something like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Toeer's got a

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. Uh,

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Dr. Tendel says you hold the orb. You have it with

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I do not carry it, but yes. Actually, did we get it back? I don't know that we handed it over or got it

**Tyram:** actually. Um, yeah, like I don't know if I ever explicitly handed it over to

**Ellis Taylor:** The entire point of us going

**Christopher Hooper:** you. I don't believe

**Walden Briarhelm:** back.

**Tyram:** them. They saw that I have it. I don't I don't think they took

**Ellis Taylor:** is the orb stuff, so we should have it with us.

**Christopher Hooper:** so.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Right. Yeah. So, yes,

**Tyram:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** we have it in our party.

**Tyram:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** May I speak to you privately to catch up on many things that we have need to catch up

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, very sincere about

**Christopher Hooper:** on?

**Walden Briarhelm:** catching up. Ah, may we first board

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Walden Briarhelm:** the ship and prepare, or should we speak before we set

**Christopher Hooper:** think we should speak before you and your friends get on the

**Walden Briarhelm:** sail? I will join

**Christopher Hooper:** boat.

**Walden Briarhelm:** you uh as we're walking and be like I will let you all know through the mental thing what's what I find

**Luke Neverisky:** Be

**Christopher Hooper:** Um he he leads

**Walden Briarhelm:** out out loud.

**Christopher Hooper:** you he leads you away and and speaks to uh the

**Luke Neverisky:** safe out

**Christopher Hooper:** commander. He says commander make sure the we are ready soon to depart. I will be back soon. Uh and he and he walks to you a few feet away on the docks and says,

**Luke Neverisky:** loud.

**Christopher Hooper:** "Omma, these people, they I am not sure that they align with what we should align with. They are obsessed with killing dragons." But you know the the legend of Luna and the god of and the dragon god of fire they were together. I have joined with them to find the what happened to Luna. But I do not know if we should work with them beyond that. Do you know what you are doing?

**Walden Briarhelm:** As I mentioned, what we have learned about this dragon ball or worm orb is that a great catastrophe could come if it falls into the wrong hands. We must do everything we can to secure

**Christopher Hooper:** What is the catastrophe from the


### [02:00:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. So, It is I

**Christopher Hooper:** orb?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I am not even familiar with it myself completely, but something about interdimensional collapse and dragons from space, it's it's more than you could imagine. It's greater than

**Christopher Hooper:** What if what if we are on the side of the dragons? Omma, they are on the side of the god

**Walden Briarhelm:** us.

**Christopher Hooper:** killers. They seek to strike down the the dragon

**Walden Briarhelm:** Do you know their entire plan or is this only what you know the details of so

**Christopher Hooper:** gods. Oh, open your eyes. Their organization is about killing dragons.

**Walden Briarhelm:** far takes a moment I find that I must make a choice between saving everything or sticking to my own principles. What What am I if everything were to fall to darkness? I hear what you are saying. I fear I must continue this journey and see out what happens next. If it is true what you say, their wrongdoings will be taken into account and justice will be found. But there are greater things at hand right now.

**Christopher Hooper:** I hope you know. Do you know the ends that they hope to make? It doesn't stop with the rebinding

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I

**Christopher Hooper:** ritual.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I we have overheard about some ritual and then

**Justin Hale:** Oops.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the ability to seek out other orbs, but nothing more has really been said. Is this what you

**Christopher Hooper:** No,

**Walden Briarhelm:** speak

**Christopher Hooper:** they are working on a weapon. The weapon that killed and struck our god. They hope to unleash it on Noraxis and

**Walden Briarhelm:** of? Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** and this St. George is working with

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** this Elderin Empire from their moon base

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Almost

**Christopher Hooper:** to

**Walden Briarhelm:** immediately as you're saying this, I'm braining to the crew. Uh, Raphael has just told me that this group of dragon warriors is working directly with Elderon and they are trying to make the moon weapon that struck down Luna something to be used

**Christopher Hooper:** group

**Walden Briarhelm:** again. Yeah. Does anybody have a reaction to that? That's pretty big. I feel

**Christopher Hooper:** thoughts.

**Ellis Taylor:** So

**Walden Briarhelm:** like so the

**Ellis Taylor:** wait, Raphael knows that. Rafael knows

**Walden Briarhelm:** new Oh, go ahead. Go

**Ellis Taylor:** that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** ahead. Uh, based on what I I would say from uh Monk Brothers, brother to brother, I would say I believe him unless I need to roll otherwise. So I would say yes, he's giving me the

**Tyram:** I mean, not necessarily that

**Walden Briarhelm:** truth. Oh, right. He

**Tyram:** he's lying, but he could. Is he

**Walden Briarhelm:** informed. Uh, as far as I'm aware, yes. And since I'm your source of truth, I would be I would believe

**Tyram:** right?

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** and he's he like he's feeding you this

**Luke Neverisky:** there.

**Christopher Hooper:** conversation over the wire. So you have like a pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** short delay of like basically getting this conversation like it it's almost firsthand, right? You know what? What you're

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm imagining I'm imagining a two second delay and the whole group that's like 15 feet behind us are like what everybody keep it calm guys.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Keep it calm. Uh uh back in character are just to be clear, are you saying that the Brotherhood of St. George is working

**Christopher Hooper:** getting

**Walden Briarhelm:** with the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. Yes. To

**Tyram:** How does he know

**Christopher Hooper:** kill

**Walden Briarhelm:** Elderon? How do you Oh. Oh, nice. Nice.

**Tyram:** that? I think

**Walden Briarhelm:** You think that? Cuz I've like how do you know this? How can you

**Christopher Hooper:** Noraxis. They told me. Go

**Walden Briarhelm:** be

**Christopher Hooper:** ask her now. Go ask any of them.

**Tyram:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** They want to kill dragons.

**Walden Briarhelm:** certain? They do not They do not even hesitate to hide

**Christopher Hooper:** No. Why would they? They have an

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** inn with a dragon skeleton on it. They do not care

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** about being

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I just thought maybe

**Christopher Hooper:** subtle. They

**Walden Briarhelm:** they were being edgy. I had no idea it was like

**Christopher Hooper:** kill dragons, my

**Walden Briarhelm:** this. Thank you.

**Christopher Hooper:** brother.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I must step away and speak with the crew. This is grave news. And as I I I don't know, we

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, and he puts

**Walden Briarhelm:** bow or something and I step away and start having

**Christopher Hooper:** he puts his his hand on your shoulder. One more

**Walden Briarhelm:** a Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** thing. If

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***.

**Justin Hale:** There's

**Christopher Hooper:** you I from my understanding, it could be beneficial for us to do this rebind. It does not. I don't think it will cut off our choices, but we

**Justin Hale:** more.

**Christopher Hooper:** will make a choice soon. Please go with your group.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I understand, brother. I have

**Christopher Hooper:** Talk to

**Walden Briarhelm:** your Holy s***. Well, okay, Toeer. Thanks for this. I would have wanted a

**Ellis Taylor:** Hey,

**Walden Briarhelm:** bio break, but I don't need one anymore. Well done.

**Justin Hale:** Repeat.

**Ellis Taylor:** hey,

**Christopher Hooper:** them.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh

**Tyram:** I hesitate to ask how that

**Walden Briarhelm:** so it's it's a good hesitation. Uh, so back

**Tyram:** works.

**Walden Briarhelm:** with the group, what do you guys have to say? Or are we what what are

**Justin Hale:** Yes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** are we saying? Or are we all shocked or what's

**Tyram:** Um, is there like a there's

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Tyram:** like a bar nearby that we can like duck inside and talk in while

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. Yeah. basically like beside every like large

**Walden Briarhelm:** up and steam?

**Christopher Hooper:** ship birth is like a bar that's like tier one bar, tier two bar or pier one, tier two bar. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Did I

**Tyram:** um have cool names.

**Christopher Hooper:** Pier 1 is um really well decorated

**Walden Briarhelm:** have

**Tyram:** a furniture

**Christopher Hooper:** um beautiful bar um tons of delicate s***. You I would suggest keeping your hands in your pockets as my mom always

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, makes

**Christopher Hooper:** told me.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** sense.

**Justin Hale:** 100%. They'll go out of business in like 15 years. Don't worry about

**Christopher Hooper:** Um here one pier two through

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** five get steadily worse interior design

**Tyram:** store.

**Christopher Hooper:** um interior until pier six which says f*** it we're doing our own thing tavern is the name of the tavern um and then after that you have very eccentric taverns after that.

**Justin Hale:** one called

**Ellis Taylor:** and bikes.

**Tyram:** f****** we're doing our own thing seems thematically appropriate for us.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. That would make for a good bar name. I

**Justin Hale:** Beia.

**Tyram:** You

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** think

**Walden Briarhelm:** Either way,

**Luke Neverisky:** So, some pretty heavy

**Walden Briarhelm:** so we find ourselves in

**Tyram:** do. I don't know. We duck into an alley or some place just somewhere out of the way for us to talk

**Walden Briarhelm:** a Right.

**Tyram:** without any people around you. Well,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Right. I I I agree.

**Tyram:** f***.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I am so beside myself on this news.

**Tyram:** Well,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** we we don't want to help the elderans because that just seems like a bad idea on principle. We want but the they also

**Ellis Taylor:** That's

**Tyram:** oppo oppose the Iron Claws. There's no there is no way we are ever siding with the Iron Claws on f****** anything.

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. A fed.

**Justin Hale:** I don't even care if they want world peace.

**Tyram:** Yeah, we will we will personally start a massive world war if it means fighting the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait, wait, wait. Who sides with the iron

**Tyram:** Iron Claw. Well, the

**Walden Briarhelm:** claws? Right. And we like

**Tyram:** St. George people oppose the Iron Claws. What?

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Justin Hale:** Peace.

**Tyram:** Opposing St. George's dudes also support the Iron Claws because I don't

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, they they've slaughtered them. Those they were

**Tyram:** want

**Walden Briarhelm:** nothing. But then,

**Tyram:** that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** oh man, this is bad. Why' you do this, Toeer? You didn't have to do

**Tyram:** I mean, no,

**Walden Briarhelm:** this. What

**Justin Hale:** Hey questions. How dare

**Tyram:** I mean, it's we just got to thread the needle, you know, it's more

**Walden Briarhelm:** a Yeah. What a great just f******


### [02:10:00]

**Tyram:** interesting this

**Walden Briarhelm:** stick in the wheel. All right.

**Justin Hale:** you?

**Tyram:** way. All right. Okay. So, something though that is worth pointing out is um regardless of allegiances and long-term plans, we still need to do this ritual for the orb. I mean, none of the rest of this matters if

**Walden Briarhelm:** I have

**Tyram:** like this galaxy eating dragon

**Walden Briarhelm:** to agree.

**Tyram:** escapes. So, we need to at least cooperate with them long enough

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I believe

**Tyram:** to deal with this

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that we know a decision will be made very soon

**Tyram:** orb.

**Walden Briarhelm:** about what comes next once this ritual is complete. I think that we will find out what their real objectives are. We have a

**Tyram:** Well, if they if doing this ritual gives them information that they want on these other orbs, maybe we shouldn't give over that information if we can avoid

**Walden Briarhelm:** plan.

**Tyram:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** It seems like our

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Tyram:** cooperation has a uh an expiration date. As soon as we deal as soon as we do this ritual, I don't think we should give them anything unless we like, you know,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I am very comfortable

**Tyram:** know what they're going to do with it

**Walden Briarhelm:** in on the sea. What happens when the ritual occurs and we are

**Tyram:** first.

**Walden Briarhelm:** stuck on a boat between uh a mixed party? We we should be prepared.

**Tyram:** Is it just your one bro there um with us? We can't count on any backup from your other moon goddess people. We chat with him. What's his plan once he makes contact with the moon goddess? How does he plan to get

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I did not think to ask him. I was and still am very much in shock that the people who opposed my God

**Tyram:** back?

**Walden Briarhelm:** are the same people we are about to

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that Pistan.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm trying to remember. I'm looking through my notes trying to

**Walden Briarhelm:** help.

**Ellis Taylor:** remember. I know we hate Elderan, but Elder, but what are they trying to do again? They're trying to make their goddess the only moon goddess. Like, why do we hate them?

**Tyram:** Um, as far as we can tell, yes, they are

**Ellis Taylor:** They made

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** uh we know that they blew up the

**Ellis Taylor:** ships.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So

**Tyram:** moon and apparently like the caused the moon

**Walden Briarhelm:** that

**Tyram:** go the other moon goddess the real moon goddess to fall to Earth. And I guess we're gonna find out what that means in the very near future here. But um uh for the time being, it's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** safe to say that uh they're doing like cosmological murder

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. I mean, they have a space

**Tyram:** right now. We also know

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, seems like

**Tyram:** that they send uh their paladins to like exterminate entire villages. Like they

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** station. Yeah.

**Tyram:** killed they did like a genocide in Red's

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Ellis Taylor:** And they're trying to seize power and take

**Luke Neverisky:** true.

**Tyram:** village. Yeah. So they

**Ellis Taylor:** over. It's

**Tyram:** definitively suck. Um

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** so I guess this this can be a character. Look, no matter what, we are not handing s***

**Walden Briarhelm:** 100%.

**Tyram:** over to these Elderan people if we can avoid it. But we're also Well, you know what? We don't need the George people to oppose the Iron Claws. We can just do that ourselves, right,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. I believe

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, you're playing talent.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that if I have if we have a plan, I could talk to

**Justin Hale:** What?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Raphael and together we could have a an action plan ready for once the

**Tyram:** Brew?

**Walden Briarhelm:** ritual is complete. He is also concerned. Perhaps we can think of what exactly we do after the ritual. He is well connected. Perhaps he can learn of where the other orbs are at and then we can all escape or

**Tyram:** Well, we know for sure that the Georgees do not know where they are right now because they needed us to hand over that information. So, we definitely should

**Ellis Taylor:** Is there is there anything back? See,

**Tyram:** keep that to

**Ellis Taylor:** he's been doing all this translating. Is there anything he's held

**Walden Briarhelm:** something.

**Ellis Taylor:** back out of concern, you know, with them working with Elderan? Um, like what on earth happens when we get all these orbs together?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I uh I almost will speak to Raphael on the ship about all of these

**Tyram:** ourselves.

**Walden Briarhelm:** questions you guys have gathered. Now, so what is what is Raphael's plan? And then uh what what happens when all of the

**Ellis Taylor:** or just is there any information he isn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** orbs come

**Ellis Taylor:** sharing with the brotherhood because or whatever there are

**Walden Briarhelm:** together?

**Ellis Taylor:** the the order

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** um anything he Yeah. What? Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** A that's the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** order.

**Christopher Hooper:** um yeah, let's take a bio

**Tyram:** Actually, I do need to step out and go to the bathroom real quick. Sorry.

**Ellis Taylor:** hearts. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** break. Um, it's like

**Walden Briarhelm:** Party

**Justin Hale:** Perfect. Got to take the dong out.

**Luke Neverisky:** There

**Ellis Taylor:** I need some water.

**Christopher Hooper:** five

**Walden Briarhelm:** time. What's up, Luke? What are you up to? You are you petting chicken, though?

**Luke Neverisky:** ow, he's someone described getting a tattoo as a cat scratching a sunburn.

**Walden Briarhelm:** fluffies.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, that's

**Luke Neverisky:** of someone who has grabbed a cat, a sunburn scratched by a

**Walden Briarhelm:** pretty bad time.

**Luke Neverisky:** cat. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Did you send that email you were talking about? Cuz I never saw

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** I think she's still she likes that. And I think she's last time I checked she was writing a response in our thread and uh she's been working on that for a while. Oh. Oh god. I just saw it. She gave me a f****** novel with good. I'm assuming it's good s*** obviously, but she's a liar. Hashtag I did my

**Christopher Hooper:** cold.

**Walden Briarhelm:** go up a lot, but you won't be

**Justin Hale:** bitcoins. God, it's three

**Walden Briarhelm:** cold.

**Justin Hale:** degrees. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** surprised.

**Ellis Taylor:** inside.

**Walden Briarhelm:** No. No. Oh my

**Justin Hale:** disgusting. God, no. Yeah. You didn't know

**Walden Briarhelm:** goodness. It's a mild

**Justin Hale:** it was an

**Walden Briarhelm:** three today.

**Justin Hale:** Eskimo?

**Luke Neverisky:** It's almost

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's -6 here right now. That's so gross.

**Justin Hale:** Thank

**Walden Briarhelm:** I don't want to even be near. I don't want to be a foot within a foot of the walls because it's like penetrating that far. And we're luckily where we're at,

**Luke Neverisky:** shorted.


### [02:20:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** the wind goes like beside the house. So, we only have one wall that gets hit instead of hitting like a like we don't our our house sits north to north or flat north, however that works. I just recall growing up in a house in a corn field where the wind hit at the corner of the house and it would just freeze out the entire side

**Ellis Taylor:** Do you have a strong prevailing wind

**Walden Briarhelm:** of both

**Ellis Taylor:** like a a normal

**Walden Briarhelm:** walls. Not really because we have a lot of trees surrounding us. So that breaks it up quite a lot which is nice.

**Ellis Taylor:** one?

**Walden Briarhelm:** But when it's -6 any amount of wind is bulldozing. Are we all back?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Because like I want to f****** murder some dragon boys

**Justin Hale:** Well, I want to hear more about your cornfield

**Ellis Taylor:** I'll be there in a sec. I'm heating water for

**Justin Hale:** diagonal

**Ellis Taylor:** tea. Just waiting for it to finish heating. But we can go.

**Walden Briarhelm:** now. You making like an oolong? What are you

**Ellis Taylor:** It is non caffeine, but I

**Walden Briarhelm:** making?

**Justin Hale:** house.

**Ellis Taylor:** think it's hobbit themed. Hold on. So, I buy tea from this thing called Chapters Tea and Coffee, and they're all like book

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. No. Come on

**Luke Neverisky:** negative6?

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean, what? There's no hot tea to give us money.

**Walden Briarhelm:** now. That's fair. Wait, wait,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, big T isn't paying out

**Christopher Hooper:** we all got our big Coca-Cola and Ford F-150 checks

**Walden Briarhelm:** paid.

**Justin Hale:** Sounds like Coper's hoarding all that

**Tyram:** Hell yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** you?

**Luke Neverisky:** lately.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, yeah. I took all the

**Justin Hale:** money.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, he's holding all the code.

**Christopher Hooper:** coke.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** crazy spice smells great.

**Christopher Hooper:** I love

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's

**Luke Neverisky:** I think Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** tacos. It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** rain

**Christopher Hooper:** raining tacos on a Saturday night in Chicago.

**Walden Briarhelm:** and

**Justin Hale:** Put a deep

**Christopher Hooper:** It's a deep dish pizza and we love our

**Tyram:** I don't know if you

**Christopher Hooper:** tacos. It's a deep dish taco. The the weird thing about a winter storm is that I I keep on thinking

**Justin Hale:** dish.

**Christopher Hooper:** like oh if the power goes out like f*** like my food is going to go bad cuz the refrigerator and I'm like oh wait it's going to be freezing outside so I can just

**Luke Neverisky:** s***

**Ellis Taylor:** Mm-

**Christopher Hooper:** put my food outside if I need

**Luke Neverisky:** fast.

**Christopher Hooper:** to.

**Justin Hale:** Legitimately that's in the winter time that's what we do with certain

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** things. We just put it on the back

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Uhhuh.

**Ellis Taylor:** Feel like I remember a standup comedian's joke about like going to like Minnesota or something and going to a party and trying putting his beer in the fridge and everyone just stares at him like what are you wasting pizza space for? Put I had him put his beed beer outside.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, I had that thought

**Tyram:** Put it in the fridge just to like warm it

**Christopher Hooper:** in my

**Justin Hale:** deck.

**Tyram:** up.

**Luke Neverisky:** Is that Fight.

**Christopher Hooper:** last Super Bowl party just and Taylor Rat too can can attest to this. I had that idea and I was like, "Oh, I'll just put the drinks outside on the porch." But it was so annoying to like go outside

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** in the cold to get a

**Ellis Taylor:** My grandparents in North Carolina, they'd always just had like a cooler out on the porch when it was like in the winter and we would

**Christopher Hooper:** drink.

**Ellis Taylor:** just put stuff out there. There's never enough fridge space. But

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** looking back, like that's a terrible idea cuz there are black bears

**Walden Briarhelm:** Go.

**Ellis Taylor:** everywhere. We would find bear and bear we'd see bears and see bear poop all

**Justin Hale:** We're

**Ellis Taylor:** the time. I was like, why are we leaving food outside? That's a terrible idea. I'm sure the bears loved it. I don't remember the bears

**Tyram:** I'm sure the bears appreciated

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** ever getting into the cooler,

**Tyram:** it.

**Justin Hale:** fine. They did that to lure the

**Ellis Taylor:** but yeah, maybe we were just eating bear meat the whole

**Justin Hale:** bears in and they'd kill the bears for bear

**Tyram:** Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** time. I did

**Tyram:** or they lured the bears in to kill their

**Ellis Taylor:** just get a cookbook that has a bear recipe in it. Yeah. Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** I hear it say human

**Ellis Taylor:** my That's good.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh my god, that is

**Luke Neverisky:** update. Yes. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** so

**Justin Hale:** mcies. I'll leave. I'll leave. It's fine. I'll

**Tyram:** family.

**Luke Neverisky:** Get it.

**Christopher Hooper:** funny. That is so funny.

**Justin Hale:** see myself.

**Ellis Taylor:** Guys, we're home. It's no wonder we've got such big sponsors like Coca-Cola and

**Tyram:** We actually

**Luke Neverisky:** Hot

**Ellis Taylor:** Por with with our negative one

**Christopher Hooper:** and

**Tyram:** just lost all of

**Ellis Taylor:** subscribers.

**Christopher Hooper:** hot. All right,

**Luke Neverisky:** tea.

**Christopher Hooper:** so um cool. Everyone's back. Um

**Tyram:** them.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, so y'all had this conversation. Um, did y'all want to talk anymore before you said uh, you were saying you wanted to talk to your brother a little bit

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh once we're on the ship because we've already

**Christopher Hooper:** more?

**Walden Briarhelm:** kind of spoken. I'm I'm think I want to move the plat forward a

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** lot. You got

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, like Silus

**Walden Briarhelm:** me.

**Tyram:** will comment like, you know, just once, just one godamn time, I want us to find a group of people

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** who like are ostensively trying to help us and for them to not end up being a bunch of assholes.

**Luke Neverisky:** I know it's Hard.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey, I didn't hide this

**Justin Hale:** The other side of the sending stone for Silus is like, "No, no, I hear you, but our hour is up,

**Christopher Hooper:** one. Oh

**Justin Hale:** so it's going to be another 300

**Christopher Hooper:** no. Oh no. No. We can't do that to

**Justin Hale:** coins.

**Tyram:** just

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus. Um okay.

**Tyram:** awful. Oh, but we probably do need to think about an exit strategy. I mean, if we burn the bridge with the with the George people. Although, is this their boat or is this just

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, it's some other dude. It's Captain Buckles.

**Tyram:** some other dude?

**Walden Briarhelm:** But

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, maybe he'll be still okay giving us a ride

**Walden Briarhelm:** what happens what happens when you have a group

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm sure you will

**Walden Briarhelm:** of people whose commander being Raphael, he uh he turns his back and now there's

**Christopher Hooper:** So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** magic stuff happening. I just see a I just don't see

**Tyram:** back.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that playing out nicely. And it's on a random boat. So, we have the captain and his crew, Dragon Boys, and we have us with possibly Bafel just being in our group, or maybe he just jumps ships and swims off. Who knows what his plan is yet? Thinking thinking what would the plan be? How many um do do we recall how many uh members were with the uh St.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, good question. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** George group?

**Christopher Hooper:** so there's Bafael and probably there's a commander and two knights. That seems to be like a click of them, but it looks like they had hierlings with them. Um, uh, probably some sort of squires if you had to guess. Um, there's probably about 10 of

**Walden Briarhelm:** say squires. I'm completely familiar with that word and that is why I'm not looking it up

**Christopher Hooper:** them like a night squire,

**Walden Briarhelm:** in the background right now.

**Ellis Taylor:** But

**Christopher Hooper:** you

**Walden Briarhelm:** like they're like a light knight then compared

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Ellis Taylor:** we hire them like they're just like mercenaries

**Christopher Hooper:** know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to they were hired by

**Ellis Taylor:** essentially.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I'm using that

**Walden Briarhelm:** the uh they were hired by the saint the

**Christopher Hooper:** more generically as just like people

**Ellis Taylor:** But so but they're

**Christopher Hooper:** working like they they look like hierlings.

**Luke Neverisky:** like a

**Ellis Taylor:** not like s whatever George dragon people die hards, right? They're just like 10 hired

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so it it's a mix there. The some of I was using the hierling phrasing like

**Ellis Taylor:** hands.

**Christopher Hooper:** generically, but there are probably 10 of them are

**Luke Neverisky:** caddy.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** St. George squires. You see that they have like St. George like uniforms

**Walden Briarhelm:** So it's not like they were workers that got that just got

**Christopher Hooper:** on. They're aspiring

**Walden Briarhelm:** hired for the day. These are people who still have paid

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** knights.

**Walden Briarhelm:** towards ah yes aspiring. There we go. Perfect.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So we've got 10

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** Aspirants.

**Walden Briarhelm:** 10 baby knights, two grown-up knights, one

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** gotcha.

**Walden Briarhelm:** elderly night, and then buffet. Okay,

**Ellis Taylor:** We can take 13. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, anyone who wants to um give me an insight

**Ellis Taylor:** cool.

**Walden Briarhelm:** perfect.

**Ellis Taylor:** Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** check, but only if you want to. You have to want

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I didn't want it enough

**Christopher Hooper:** to. Okay,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Boom. Yeah, I want

**Tyram:** I want

**Christopher Hooper:** good. What'd you get,


### [02:30:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** to die up to like a 50.

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus? 20. Uh, one thing that

**Tyram:** to 20

**Ellis Taylor:** apparently.

**Christopher Hooper:** you're thinking is like they're planning on fighting dragons plural. So, they're going to do that with

**Tyram:** 20

**Christopher Hooper:** like four people, your group, and like 10 like baby

**Walden Briarhelm:** How are we going? Yeah, we we need to talk to them what their

**Christopher Hooper:** knights.

**Walden Briarhelm:** plan is like now that we've discussed and thought through. Yeah. How the f*** are 20 people going to fight two dragons on a boat? How big is uh Captain Buckle's crew? Did we We don't know that, do

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, no, you don't. Uh from looking around, you see um there's probably those the the rest of the hierlings um

**Walden Briarhelm:** we?

**Christopher Hooper:** that are really hirings. There's another 10 of them and then there's already probably like 10 to 20 people on the boat just like getting the the boat

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** ready. Mhm. Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Limit. There's There's something a foot here. There's

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** there's no one dragon would probably be a real bad time just because also water environment.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** believe at this point we do not have

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** enough information to make much sense of this but we must return to what happens after the ritual. What are we going to do? Is there is there like a a a we're we're going to be out at sea. It's not like we

**Tyram:** I hate

**Walden Briarhelm:** can

**Tyram:** myself for saying this, but there's one person in Greyport who's connected to all of this dragon business that I remember who I don't think has anything to do with the St. Georgees. That might be a place we might be able to lay

**Ellis Taylor:** What is

**Walden Briarhelm:** What do

**Tyram:** low. Brew, do you know where f****** Victor

**Ellis Taylor:** that?

**Justin Hale:** Oh man, he's gonna love to see you,

**Tyram:** is? I

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, oh no.

**Walden Briarhelm:** you think? This must be one of his close

**Justin Hale:** buddy.

**Tyram:** hate it already.

**Walden Briarhelm:** friends.

**Tyram:** He said he was coming here. He was investigating that dragon, the literal dragon s***, the last time we saw him, and he says he's here now. He's one person in this city who has nothing to do with these

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Tyram:** uh St. Georgees or Ironclaws or anything like that who we

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** apparently also not connected to Elderan. He might be the one

**Justin Hale:** I'm going to pull out the

**Tyram:** person we can go to for help

**Justin Hale:** very ostentatious uh Victor sending stone that's

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** like completely with all of his logos and embellishments and all that. I'm gonna pull out the obnoxiously long antenna. I'm gonna ring him up.

**Tyram:** here. I already regret

**Walden Briarhelm:** Who

**Tyram:** this.

**Walden Briarhelm:** is Victor associated with? Which group?

**Tyram:** Victor was the one who gave us the bombs to go around blowing up like the

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, he disappeared forever looking up for or

**Tyram:** drug facilities

**Walden Briarhelm:** trying to go find resources. Was

**Tyram:** in um he was the one

**Walden Briarhelm:** that Yes. Yes. Sulfur.

**Tyram:** who kept bitching about like sulfur.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. Okay. Right. We didn't really like want to trust him very well because he was so flaky with us. Or so we thought.

**Tyram:** Um, well, he's just an incompetent buffoon is the reason Silus doesn't want to do anything with him. But I don't think there's a trust issue here. It's more of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Follow

**Tyram:** a he sucks

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so you get a

**Tyram:** issue.

**Christopher Hooper:** ring. Um, hello

### [02:40:00]

**Tyram:** I was thinking. It just seemed like something that was like a plot thread that was laid out a really long time ago and I was trying to pick up

**Walden Briarhelm:** What?

**Justin Hale:** Um, he did need the dragon egg

**Tyram:** on it, but no. I mean, we're going. Apparently, there's going to be dragon eggs where we're going.

**Justin Hale:** though. I don't

**Tyram:** I don't know. But did just say you wanted to make it into an

**Justin Hale:** think you could hear that part. It's not important what he needs it for. He just said he needed

**Tyram:** omelette.

**Ellis Taylor:** What happened to

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Tyram:** No, that that's an idiotic waste of a dragon egg. We could sell it for a lot of money.

**Ellis Taylor:** our What happened to our baby

**Justin Hale:** I

**Tyram:** We're not using it for an

**Ellis Taylor:** dragon? What happened to our baby

**Justin Hale:** mean,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, let's

**Ellis Taylor:** dragon?

**Tyram:** omelette. Pepsi back with the

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Were you bringing

**Tyram:** bugatti. Are we bringing Pepsi? I don't think we should bring Pepsi around all these George

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** what? Yeah, probably

**Christopher Hooper:** Pepsi? Okay, makes sense.

**Justin Hale:** not.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. And uh, all right. Y'all get on the boat and set sail. Sound

**Tyram:** people.

**Ellis Taylor:** god. Where?

**Justin Hale:** Who's that chick that's been tagging along that's not with

**Luke Neverisky:** Sounds

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Walden Briarhelm:** logical scarlet.

**Justin Hale:** us right now? Yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** Scarlet, where is she?

**Justin Hale:** her. She's with Pepsi, I

**Ellis Taylor:** Scarlet, is Scarlet in

**Christopher Hooper:** She's with

**Justin Hale:** assume. Yeah, she's the one taking care of

**Ellis Taylor:** town with us?

**Christopher Hooper:** Pepsi. Yeah, she's always

**Justin Hale:** Pepsi.

**Tyram:** Yes,

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. She's She's like an annoying little

**Christopher Hooper:** around.

**Justin Hale:** She's been really

**Tyram:** she travels with

**Ellis Taylor:** sister. Just always

**Christopher Hooper:** No, she's very helpful in doing most

**Ellis Taylor:** there. This is

**Christopher Hooper:** of your research for you.

**Tyram:** us. She's also

**Ellis Taylor:** true. I

**Tyram:** Toper's character if he ever wants to take from

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. She's super cool and all of you like her a

**Justin Hale:** annoying. No, she sucks.

**Tyram:** DM.

**Justin Hale:** She's a knowit all and she's always butting into everybody's

**Tyram:** Well, there's always

**Christopher Hooper:** lot.

**Justin Hale:** business.

**Tyram:** the constant worry that she'll start building the time and doom the

**Justin Hale:** That's the least of my biggest number one worry is she's

**Luke Neverisky:** This is

**Justin Hale:** annoying.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. So, you said sails as you hear Captain Buckle saying, "All

**Tyram:** universe.

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** right, batten down the hatches. We're setting sail." Everyone, hold on tight. Um, all right. and the rowers start rowing, the sailor start sailing, and uh you start moving out out of the harbor.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, they're

**Tyram:** Wait, they're

**Justin Hale:** sailing and

**Tyram:** mowing. Like, how are we

**Justin Hale:** rowing. Yeah, you

**Tyram:** in like a Viking longboat? Like,

**Justin Hale:** didn't get that vibe this whole time. Are you listening

**Tyram:** how No, I thought we were using modern

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Justin Hale:** to, Taylor?

**Tyram:** boat. This is like the worst boat we could possibly

**Justin Hale:** That was crazy

**Tyram:** take. We're gonna This

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's

**Justin Hale:** fast.

**Tyram:** is We could f****** swim and get there

**Walden Briarhelm:** like it's like like a hybrid engine, you

**Justin Hale:** No.

**Tyram:** faster. Is there a

**Justin Hale:** No. Yeah, it's a bunch of people.

**Tyram:** motor on this boat?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes, of course.

**Justin Hale:** Hello. We got

**Tyram:** Is there a motor that isn't people

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, of course. But you can't use

**Justin Hale:** like like 10 manpower here. What are you talking

**Christopher Hooper:** that in the harbor. It's a no wake

**Justin Hale:** about?

**Ellis Taylor:** Duh.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, you got to troll

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Tyram:** rowing?

**Christopher Hooper:** zone. You know,

**Walden Briarhelm:** out. Jesus. All right, so

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor, it's really embarrassing how little you know

**Walden Briarhelm:** we've

**Christopher Hooper:** about harbor at Harbor uh behavior right now. And I'm just going to let it

**Tyram:** I have never once seen a boat

**Christopher Hooper:** slide.

**Tyram:** row in a f******

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Tyram:** harbor. That is not a

**Justin Hale:** It's like it's like you don't even know like maritime etiquette

**Tyram:** thing.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** You

**Justin Hale:** at

**Ellis Taylor:** Like, how are you not well verssed in maritime law at

**Christopher Hooper:** row out until you hit beyond the reef and then you can turn on the

**Tyram:** This isn't a matter of me

**Ellis Taylor:** all?

**Tyram:** not knowing something that is a real thing. This isn't a real

**Christopher Hooper:** motor. This is

**Justin Hale:** all. How would How would you

**Tyram:** thing. People don't go in the f******

**Justin Hale:** know? How would you know? Are you some sort of maritime expert, Taylor

**Christopher Hooper:** This is why all cruise boats

**Tyram:** harbor. Apparently amongst this group I

**Christopher Hooper:** have all cruise boats have

**Tyram:** am

**Christopher Hooper:** little row ports for all the the workers

**Ellis Taylor:** slaves.

**Christopher Hooper:** to row the the cruise boats

**Justin Hale:** H? Yeah,

**Tyram:** No, they

**Christopher Hooper:** out. It's okay. I

**Tyram:** don't.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's kind of It's kind of a classist thing to assume that. All right. So, this

**Justin Hale:** exactly.

**Christopher Hooper:** is we're going to assume you don't know that you have to row out of port when you're on the boat, even if it has a

**Walden Briarhelm:** What is

**Justin Hale:** It's okay. Now you know. Now

**Tyram:** Whatever.

**Christopher Hooper:** motor. Yeah, it's okay. Now, you

**Walden Briarhelm:** happening?

**Justin Hale:** you

**Tyram:** So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** What?

**Tyram:** Captain Buckle sucks, too. Got it. All

**Christopher Hooper:** know, no, the world the world and society

**Walden Briarhelm:** Buckle

**Christopher Hooper:** hates Taylor specifically.

**Walden Briarhelm:** up.

**Justin Hale:** know.

**Tyram:** right, I

**Walden Briarhelm:** Have we made

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it out of port yet? Are we like at

**Tyram:** guess.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. Uh, that you see the ores come back in and they turn the motor

**Walden Briarhelm:** C? We were almost there. I felt the cadence

**Christopher Hooper:** on. Oh.

**Walden Briarhelm:** almost. Oh, so we are on the boat ports. Uh the the ports no longer have ores in them because we're moving too

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah, we're past the no zone. Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** quickly.

**Christopher Hooper:** they they drop in the motor.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Are

**Justin Hale:** aka

**Walden Briarhelm:** we uh are we able to see that like the uh the the Dragon Brotherhood uh Jesus, I can't say. The St. George uh people, are they doing anything worth

**Justin Hale:** health.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** noticing? Like do they do they seem to have like a formation they're working on or are they all just kind of keeping to

**Christopher Hooper:** Um they they're it

**Walden Briarhelm:** themselves?

**Christopher Hooper:** looks like they're preparing for battle.

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** They're sharpening swords, stretching stuff like

**Tyram:** I'd actually like to actually like to pick their brains a little bit. So, uh, how exactly are you guys going to be able to like deal

**Christopher Hooper:** that. Oh. Uh we'll

**Tyram:** with the dragons

**Christopher Hooper:** probably shoot him.

**Walden Briarhelm:** When

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** you say that you are going to shoot them, what do you

**Tyram:** here?

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, uh, we normally get a couple grappling hooks in them.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, send a couple people up on top and then, um, cut their head off and then, um, yeah, we'll, uh, try to use

**Justin Hale:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** a grappling hooks to pull their carcass onto the boat and carve

**Ellis Taylor:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** them right

**Ellis Taylor:** What do you do with

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Ellis Taylor:** them?

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, um we will we'll probably sell the hide to Armorus. Um we we may collect some of the bones for for more armor. And uh if we still have enough of the skeleton left, we'll probably open another

**Ellis Taylor:** Interesting.

**Christopher Hooper:** tavern. Yeah, the

**Ellis Taylor:** Interesting.

**Christopher Hooper:** taverns are really popular with uh bachelor parties. So, um we're making that's honestly uh one of the main economic vehicles for our

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I mean it is strong branding. I'll give you

**Christopher Hooper:** organization. So, uh

**Ellis Taylor:** that. No, what? No,

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah.

**Tyram:** because of all your

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm talking about the dragon

**Tyram:** f****** No, I mean like with the bachelor

**Ellis Taylor:** imagery.

**Tyram:** parties like is that what the bachelor parties are like

**Christopher Hooper:** What? You're the guy that didn't know about the

**Tyram:** attracted to?

**Ellis Taylor:** I like to imagine

**Justin Hale:** Got

**Tyram:** You know, you can just set the motor down to a lower

**Ellis Taylor:** that. It's incredibly

**Tyram:** setting. It's incredibly stupid to

**Ellis Taylor:** wasteful of valuable

**Christopher Hooper:** rowing.

**Justin Hale:** him. Excuse him. He doesn't know a

**Ellis Taylor:** energy. This is

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I

**Justin Hale:** lot about the maritime etiquette around here.

**Ellis Taylor:** clearly

**Christopher Hooper:** get it. You're probably new. There's some some weird things about

**Tyram:** row.

**Christopher Hooper:** great you just kind of get used to. They've got these silly songs and stuff. Bowser players are kind of crazy, but um yeah, that's probably what we'll do. Um I think we'll probably uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** we've got some boat station out there that should help us with some of the other dragons. We're hoping to get quite a collection today. um if we start an engagement. But uh um Rafael told us that um ideally we want to go ahead and get the ritual done um under stealth of night um if we can. Um so we might have to be fighting our way out. We'll see. What are y'all uh y'all y'all are part of the ritual crew, right? Y are going to get in and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh yes, that is that is the plan. Do you by chance know where Rafael is

**Christopher Hooper:** out. Yeah, I think he was um

**Walden Briarhelm:** now?

**Christopher Hooper:** I think he's back at the uh I don't know the boat term, but the butt of the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, he is on the poop deck. I will go visit

**Ellis Taylor:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** boat. I think that's the

**Walden Briarhelm:** him there. Well, if it's about the

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, that's definitely the

**Christopher Hooper:** I think that's the front of the boat,

**Walden Briarhelm:** captain's crew, you don't know what kind of ship it is,

**Ellis Taylor:** stern, guys. I lived

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Is the stir in the

**Walden Briarhelm:** right? Well, we're on the very back. We will be

**Ellis Taylor:** under a mountain and I know this

**Walden Briarhelm:** spider. We will be

**Ellis Taylor:** stuff.

**Walden Briarhelm:** spider walking on the back side of this.

**Tyram:** You were giving me s*** about not knowing about boats. You don't even know what the f****** stern

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes, cuz you

**Christopher Hooper:** front? Yeah. How about him,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Just be

**Ellis Taylor:** did,

**Tyram:** is. No, I'm talking to you, George

**Ellis Taylor:** Sylus.

**Christopher Hooper:** Halfling? Oh,

**Tyram:** assholes. Yeah, you're all like, "Oh, is that what the stern is?"

**Christopher Hooper:** what? Well, I

**Tyram:** And you were giving me s*** a minute ago.

**Christopher Hooper:** mean, yeah. Okay, fair.

**Walden Briarhelm:** clear. Anyways, going to uh going to excuse himself


### [02:50:00]

**Tyram:** f***

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh you

**Walden Briarhelm:** and try to find

**Christopher Hooper:** see uh Bafael on the um he's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Raphael.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh standing by the captain, but he's not talking to him. He's kind of looking out at sea. Um just kind of gazing out

**Tyram:** yourself.

**Christopher Hooper:** um and he sees you coming says, "Ola, welcome. Will you join me?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, yes, of course. Looking out at the sea. Do you uh does Bafel say anything or do I do I start a conversation

**Christopher Hooper:** Um if he would he'll fill the silence if you want but you can start if

**Walden Briarhelm:** here?

**Christopher Hooper:** you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Bafel, what is your plan? What happens if the dragons attack? What happens if the ritual finishes and suddenly they all turn on us?

**Christopher Hooper:** Why why if we do the ritual they would turn on us?

**Walden Briarhelm:** You were the one who told me as soon as they have what they want, why would they need us anymore? Why would they need you anymore?

**Christopher Hooper:** Why? Even though our aims are not the same as theirs, I believe they are men of honor. They believe what they are doing and they believe we are aligned with them as long as we are on their side. They will protect us and allow us to explore what is going on. But eventually we will have to choose to be their enemy. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I I grow more concerned that that is exactly what will happen. I do have another question. These orbs they seek, do we know what they are for or what they do when you bring them all

**Christopher Hooper:** think. I do not know. You think that

**Walden Briarhelm:** together?

**Christopher Hooper:** if they are brought together, I can only think something terrible might happen. But maybe this astral, it would concentrate her power. Maybe. I don't know if that's good or

**Walden Briarhelm:** I too have

**Christopher Hooper:** not.

**Walden Briarhelm:** fears of what will happen. I I would suggest that you watch your back. While these people may seem honorable, we have seen what the Elderon can do. And if they are working together, they are not to be

**Christopher Hooper:** What have you seen,

**Walden Briarhelm:** trusted. The Elderon are the one who blew up the moon. They directly attacked Luna.

**Christopher Hooper:** brother? Yes, that makes sense. With the moon weapon, it's so hard to get everything straight.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, we're really stuck on our shells, aren't we?

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, it was simpler when on our island. I wish that turtle never got

**Walden Briarhelm:** Now, times have changed. I'm going to go back to the crew and let them know that I have informed you and that there is little we know as for what happens next. If we form a plan,

**Christopher Hooper:** up. Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I will keep you updated. So, excuse Omar excuses himself again and rejoins the crew. Please, uh, if you guys want to, please get into it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Is anyone else um exploring anything right

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, uh, reiterates all that to the

**Christopher Hooper:** now? Um if not um you um it it begins to get dark. The the day waines.

**Walden Briarhelm:** group.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um as mentioned, y'all are heading to an area that is um frequented by dragons. So, if there's any like preparation spells or anything you want to do uh beforehand, now would be a good time. You're

**Ellis Taylor:** I know. I'm going to go ahead and just summon

**Christopher Hooper:** muted, Ellis, but that sounds

**Ellis Taylor:** Bob so he's with me. How long does that

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Ellis Taylor:** last? Five

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** hours.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um and at a certain point uh Rafael uh comes to your group and says we should talk about the ritual. Do you know what you must

**Ellis Taylor:** Not a

**Tyram:** Did we ever uh find anything about that like hell just journals or anything

**Ellis Taylor:** clue. Hey, Raphael's going to tell

**Christopher Hooper:** do?

**Tyram:** like how the ritual is supposed to

**Ellis Taylor:** us.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um you uh you were given there was a tablet that uh outlined what the ritual

**Tyram:** work? Okay. The one from the

**Christopher Hooper:** was. Mhm. I believe that we will all have to give our blood freely. Are you ready to do

**Ellis Taylor:** Give my side.

**Christopher Hooper:** that?

**Tyram:** vault. How much are we talking? Like how much blood do we have to like just like prick our fingers or do we have to like bleed out like a

**Christopher Hooper:** What? I don't know. I've never done

**Tyram:** unsettling amount of

**Christopher Hooper:** this before. I have already collected the violescent spheres and the salt. And we know the dragon

**Tyram:** blood?

**Christopher Hooper:** name,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the the full name or

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** the like the common name. There's many names for the

**Christopher Hooper:** I believe there is

**Walden Briarhelm:** beast.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh there there is one name a minox says this is the name that should be said at the ritual. It is important. Whoever holds Ring Goth must be the one to speak the name. But I do not know what will

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** happen. You uh Silus is it? Will you be ready to do this?

**Tyram:** Well, I guess I better

**Christopher Hooper:** I think she will seek to challenge you. Challenge your your will, your mind. Are

**Tyram:** be.

**Christopher Hooper:** you the best suited?

**Tyram:** Yeah, he's

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So, you know what I'm talking

**Tyram:** done. Yeah, like but

**Christopher Hooper:** about.

**Tyram:** hey, I get a I get a little help from my friends, you know, and that does make it

**Justin Hale:** You get by with little help from your

**Tyram:** easier. I I I do get by with a little help

**Justin Hale:** friend.

**Tyram:** from my

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay. Then

**Tyram:** friends.

**Christopher Hooper:** everyone understands what the ritual is and is

**Ellis Taylor:** Sure. No, I have no

**Christopher Hooper:** ready.

**Tyram:** Do we I mean do our characters know? Because I

**Ellis Taylor:** clue. I know I got a bleed on something and there's orbs and salt. That's all I

**Tyram:** don't. Well, like

**Ellis Taylor:** got.

**Tyram:** we read the thing before and like even like Victor apparently made those like Violescence orbs like for the ritual, I thought.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Right.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh yeah, we've got those

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** Didn't we have those orbs? I mean,

**Ellis Taylor:** Fix.

**Tyram:** we Yeah, we got the perfect spherical orbs. So, like, are those good for the

**Christopher Hooper:** so um, yeah, but it seems like

**Tyram:** ritual and

**Christopher Hooper:** he already has

**Tyram:** everything? I don't care whose

**Ellis Taylor:** apparently we got to do this seven

**Christopher Hooper:** some. I mean, these are things you could ask in

**Tyram:** orbs we use.

**Ellis Taylor:** times.

**Christopher Hooper:** person or you

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** So, do we still have

**Christopher Hooper:** can

**Ellis Taylor:** the tablet that tells us what to do?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I believe y'all took a rubbing of

**Ellis Taylor:** Hey, come

**Tyram:** Yeah, I guess I I I take that out of my backpack and I review it. Like, what do I need to

**Ellis Taylor:** here. Like, guys, guys, where's our

**Christopher Hooper:** it. I

**Tyram:** do?

**Christopher Hooper:** mean, yeah, he just went over it. Uh, so,

**Ellis Taylor:** homework?

**Christopher Hooper:** um, Hello

**Ellis Taylor:** I know. I'm tired.

**Christopher Hooper:** dragon. Should we Should we just call it and resume next time? I feel like we should just call it and resume next time. I'm talking to a bunch of zombies right now. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** right, we'll resume this uh next

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Yeah. So, we are on the ship. Night has fallen and we are preparing

**Christopher Hooper:** session. Yeah, that sounds


### [03:00:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** for the ritual next time.

**Ellis Taylor:** Ritual/bite

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay. Awesome. Well, I wasn't even really personally

**Ellis Taylor:** dragons.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that hooked into Luna, but now I'm like, well, Toeer Toeer went and did the thing, whirlwinded all of our groups, and

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I feel like it's the only thing that makes sense,

**Walden Briarhelm:** now it's great.

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** and then talking about bringing Pepsi in be like no nope Pepsi doesn't join

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, wait. Taxi shouldn't join us with the

**Walden Briarhelm:** us dragons

**Christopher Hooper:** dragon killer, should

**Walden Briarhelm:** that is a good uh I guess I guess he's still

**Ellis Taylor:** Does Pepsi love brew

**Walden Briarhelm:** small say that's an exit strategy for Brew though he can get

**Ellis Taylor:** yet or is he still working on it? Okay,

**Justin Hale:** Pepsi has always

**Tyram:** Yeah, Pepsi loves

**Justin Hale:** loved brew. What are you even talking

**Tyram:** Brew.

**Ellis Taylor:** good.

**Justin Hale:** about?

**Tyram:** They show more conventional forms of affection

**Christopher Hooper:** he? Yeah. All right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** out and Pepsi is a brown drink. I just realized like that just adds to

**Justin Hale:** See? See? It all comes
