**Ellis Taylor:** Huh? No, we're us. No, we're uh it's Lotus

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Tyram:** But thank goodness.


### [00:10:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** tell you it's not the hangover, too.

**Christopher Hooper:** hope Luke I hope at I hope Ellis talked to you about this

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, good.

**Christopher Hooper:** session because we're freeing

**Tyram:** Okay,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. No, she totally talked about that. Yep. 100%.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. No. Yeah, I'm doing all your

**Christopher Hooper:** Helisana.

**Tyram:** yeah. Oh, but Luke, you're probably thinking of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep. Yeah. No, I

**Ellis Taylor:** character development.

**Tyram:** um Justin and I are gonna collaborate to do the uh the the heist

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Tyram:** that was part of Ru and Silus's background. And uh when we do that,

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Tyram:** you guys will uh probably just be reskinned uh

**Luke Neverisky:** that's

**Tyram:** characters or if you want to make characters, that's fine.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I

**Tyram:** Um theoretically, like Silus and Brew are way stronger than they were back when they were doing the heist. So,

**Ellis Taylor:** No. Oh, we're doing like a flashback to when

**Tyram:** but

**Ellis Taylor:** you guys stole the orb. Oh, that'll be a

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, that makes sense considering

**Ellis Taylor:** fun one. I would totally be down for

**Christopher Hooper:** I Yeah, I think so, too.

**Ellis Taylor:** just a reskinned character that dies. No,

**Tyram:** yes. Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** they die

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, we should all die,

**Tyram:** Like it is part of the backstory that yes, all of you die at the end of the session.

**Ellis Taylor:** later at the end of the session or later on where they

**Tyram:** Oh, I guess you'll

**Ellis Taylor:** hunted down. How are you? How are you feeling, Ally?

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Tyram:** see. Oh, but at least two of

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I guess we'll have to find

**Tyram:** you need to be named uh peaches and cream. Those were the only names I

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh my god.

**Ali Leonard:** I'm planning my origin,

**Tyram:** remember. What? Okay. One of you can be peaches, the

**Luke Neverisky:** Dudes,

**Ellis Taylor:** Dibs, dance, dibs,

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Ali Leonard:** too.

**Tyram:** other one can be

**Luke Neverisky:** peaches, what do you want to

**Ellis Taylor:** dibs. Can I

**Luke Neverisky:** do? Okay, fine. I can be

**Ellis Taylor:** be peaches?

**Tyram:** cream. Sick.

**Luke Neverisky:** green.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm Rocky

**Ali Leonard:** That's an orange cat and a light

**Tyram:** I don't think any of the names have been established

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Tyram:** um as far part of our background yet. So yeah, everything anything else can just be whatever they

**Christopher Hooper:** Road. I think maybe Rocky Road

**Tyram:** want. And

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes. Or

**Christopher Hooper:** or Strawberry Shortcake. Trying to figure out which

**Ali Leonard:** cat.

**Tyram:** Brew are really the outcast in this group because the only ones that didn't have like food

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** cookies and cream. And then it gets very confusing because

**Tyram:** for names.

**Ali Leonard:** It's their leaf names, their

**Tyram:** Yeah. Oh, okay. So yeah, maybe Sil actually no.

**Christopher Hooper:** one.

**Tyram:** Silus. Uh, Silus's name when he was doing that was

**Ellis Taylor:** it's

**Tyram:** Bartleby Thatch. So, that'll be what uh that'll be what

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh lord. Why don't you

**Tyram:** Silus have to go by at the

**Ellis Taylor:** keep everyone else shows

**Ali Leonard:** covers and everyone else is like, "We're going with ice cream theme. What are you

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** here? It's like Silus, why are you not on

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Then we'll have to Then we'll

**Ali Leonard:** doing?

**Tyram:** time.

**Christopher Hooper:** have to replay Helga's last moments and say as Silus is asking what are their names? She'll have to go

**Ellis Taylor:** theme?

**Christopher Hooper:** Peaches and Cream, Rocky Road, Strawberry

**Tyram:** I thought it made for a better moment that she didn't remember

**Ali Leonard:** cuz it's

**Tyram:** the names.

**Christopher Hooper:** Shortcake. Yeah, but it would be really funny

**Ali Leonard:** impossible to forget

**Christopher Hooper:** if if we had already established

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. Really takes some of the punch out of my

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Tyram:** like, you know, final like jab at her like you don't remember their name.

**Ali Leonard:** those

**Tyram:** Oh, you do. Okay. Well, this is actually a little awkward. I'm gonna kill you

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** sorry.

**Tyram:** anyway. But now we're just waiting on Justin and Zach. Those

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh no. I feel like they're here in spirit, which is close

**Tyram:** bastards. It

**Walden Briarhelm:** First.

**Christopher Hooper:** enough.

**Tyram:** is. Do we want to go and do the recap? Is it even necessary to do a recap since we're doing like a side thing

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Um I mean

**Tyram:** anyway?

**Ellis Taylor:** sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. What happened in Ark

**Ali Leonard:** Oh

**Tyram:** Maybe not all of Ark 2,

**Luke Neverisky:** What

**Tyram:** but I do like to imagine like Olivia's

**Luke Neverisky:** happened?

**Tyram:** back down in the village like, you know, working with logistics, like directing like crews

**Ali Leonard:** god.

**Tyram:** to go like pick up rubble and like get infrastructure set up and she's thinking to herself, you know, hey, Silus and Brew really grew as people, you know, like they really like stepped up here. And then like Silus and Brew come cruising in with the

**Christopher Hooper:** 2?

**Tyram:** Bugatti and start doing like donuts around the parking lot like they left

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm just like, "God damn.

**Tyram:** the Bugatti. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Damn it. He's like, "God damn

**Tyram:** Oh man, honestly, I'm jazzed as hell that we got the Bugatti back. Like, you know, we're going to have a whole fleet of

**Luke Neverisky:** That's really

**Tyram:** cars. So, right now, we have the the Ford F-150,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that's the real victory.

**Tyram:** the Bugatti, the Broomfall, and the Zoomfall,

**Ellis Taylor:** it. We got We did get the fort back. That was that was very

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I thought that

**Tyram:** right? f***

**Ellis Taylor:** infuriating. Yeah, it's

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** was the city owned

**Tyram:** that. We're taking it. Did they give us the

**Ellis Taylor:** a city

**Tyram:** keys? Then it's our car.

**Ellis Taylor:** vehicle. We had the keys. We did

**Ali Leonard:** Now, I was explicitly told

**Tyram:** Right.

**Ali Leonard:** the idiot Mcdot face was driving

**Ellis Taylor:** this. He's He's endearing. I feel like I'm heavily My opinion is heavily colored by the AI like

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** overview I read. Um, let's see. I guess

**Justin Hale:** which was what? We

**Ellis Taylor:** it was just said that he's he's he's he's

**Justin Hale:** We weren't very nice to the

**Ellis Taylor:** competent. He's just very socially awkward and needs guidance essentially is what the AI

**Ali Leonard:** the See,

**Justin Hale:** Jenzers

**Ellis Taylor:** said. He might

**Ali Leonard:** I'm colored by the fact that he's going to murder

**Ellis Taylor:** he might wear my skin. We'll see.

**Ali Leonard:** you. So, I just really don't love that. And

**Justin Hale:** who Oh, Chuck

**Tyram:** He does have serious stalker energy.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we're talking about rock

**Ali Leonard:** I think instinctually I want to

**Justin Hale:** Ros.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, he

**Ali Leonard:** protect. I'm like, "Oh, serial killer

**Luke Neverisky:** does definitely. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like

**Ali Leonard:** shouldn't give him a Ford F150."

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, he he's going to wear your skin as a suit for

**Christopher Hooper:** y'all just assume the worst out of every

**Justin Hale:** sure.

**Tyram:** Yeah. You told us he has figurines of

**Ali Leonard:** But he has figurines

**Ellis Taylor:** chalk.

**Christopher Hooper:** embassy of the whole of whole police

**Ali Leonard:** and that's a sign of a serial

**Tyram:** Olivia. That's not better.

**Ellis Taylor:** He's lonely

**Ali Leonard:** killer. He said he had a lot of

**Justin Hale:** I

**Tyram:** These are informed

**Luke Neverisky:** Awi has a shrine.

**Ellis Taylor:** and he's trying to

**Ali Leonard:** Olivia and he said he has some of Olivia's hair, so I don't love

**Justin Hale:** wonder. I

**Tyram:** assumptions that we're making about chalk rock or chalk

**Ellis Taylor:** like they

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Justin Hale:** wonder who, hold

**Ali Leonard:** The idiot.

**Justin Hale:** on, who would have instilled that

**Tyram:** rock. That

**Christopher Hooper:** department. I don't

**Justin Hale:** Pavlovian nature into this

**Tyram:** is an excellent point.

**Ellis Taylor:** are

**Christopher Hooper:** know. I don't know why you don't trust

**Justin Hale:** party? Yeah. Who turned

**Tyram:** I can count on one hand a

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** the NPCs or anything they do.

**Justin Hale:** Pokemon into rapid science

**Tyram:** number of NPCs in this campaign who didn't betray us or like somehow like turn out to be this huge piece of

**Justin Hale:** experiments?

**Christopher Hooper:** I gotta say, when I was making my list of like the

**Tyram:** s***.

**Christopher Hooper:** NPCs that were going to be captured that y'all gave a s*** about, I'm like,

**Tyram:** You couldn't even

**Christopher Hooper:** oop, this is rough. All

**Ali Leonard:** Damn.

**Tyram:** fill out all the cages without resorting to someone who we did not

**Ellis Taylor:** surprise. George

**Tyram:** care died

**Christopher Hooper:** right, here you go.

**Justin Hale:** I am rather surprised you

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Justin Hale:** haven't manipulated our love of Jasper for something like

**Tyram:** explicitly.

**Christopher Hooper:** Jasper. I don't want to kill Jasper. He's

**Ali Leonard:** That's

**Justin Hale:** this. Ah, there it

**Tyram:** He's

**Christopher Hooper:** like doing good in the world, you

**Ali Leonard:** you. And

**Justin Hale:** is.

**Ellis Taylor:** He's abducting orphans. What are you talking

**Ali Leonard:** we have we have free tickets to

**Tyram:** know that is true. Ter

**Christopher Hooper:** know?

**Ali Leonard:** see him later. So, it's like we got to keep him

**Tyram:** would burn a plot hook if he killed Jasper.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, that's that's actually a really great way for you to know which NPCs

**Ali Leonard:** alive.

**Justin Hale:** That makes

**Christopher Hooper:** to trust is if you already have a plot hook with that

**Tyram:** Oh, so if we find an NPC we

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. FL

**Christopher Hooper:** NPC

**Tyram:** like, we should like kind of like plant the seed like,

**Luke Neverisky:** armor.

**Ellis Taylor:** about? Make

**Justin Hale:** sense. Meta the s*** out of it.

**Tyram:** hey, well, yeah, we need to like somehow like set up a future

**Ellis Taylor:** them make them essential.

**Christopher Hooper:** later.

**Justin Hale:** Uhhuh. Make them super important.

**Tyram:** meeting and try to make it like super plot critical

**Ellis Taylor:** like Naomi. She's She's so

**Justin Hale:** a a very quick flashback

**Ali Leonard:** down.

**Justin Hale:** of uh Silus trying to argue with Brew for the top bunk and Pepsi just snarling at him and immediately winning that

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** argument.

**Ali Leonard:** So when Kevin comes to wake Elizabeth up, I assume that cuz Boxbox is powered down next to Elizabeth, so I assume Kevin just snuggles in with us instead of waking us

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** You get a whisper in your ear. I'm

**Ali Leonard:** up. I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** god, Kevin, don't get

**Ali Leonard:** Kevin. And just cuddles under the

**Tyram:** Okay, so since it's like the like break of dawn, I assume

**Luke Neverisky:** You wait a

**Ali Leonard:** covers. I'm

**Tyram:** Olivia is already out making her bodega run.

**Ellis Taylor:** creepy. Oh, Olivia's already had

**Ali Leonard:** Kevin.

**Luke Neverisky:** second.

**Ellis Taylor:** a full workout and has brought everyone back muffins for her

**Tyram:** All right. So, we gota wait for Olivia to get back before we kind of head

**Luke Neverisky:** She already walks around the mall and

**Ellis Taylor:** usual.

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's about

**Tyram:** out, I guess. But,

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, let's say you've gathered everyone in

**Tyram:** um,

**Ellis Taylor:** like the main living area and Olivia comes

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** okay. Uh so um Helisada went for that audition and apparently she's like uh her and the Ravers have like started a uh an occupation of the place like they're doing concerts 24/7 and

**Ellis Taylor:** home.

**Tyram:** uh apparently they're just like really being bad guests.

**Luke Neverisky:** What color means the

**Tyram:** Um, well, hey, I got her out of the city. But you know what? This cannot stand. Uh, my honey lamb is not getting a good night's sleep. So, we are going to go there and handle this right the f***

**Luke Neverisky:** pride? That's so cute. You call her a

**Tyram:** now. Whatever. Yeah, let's

**Luke Neverisky:** honey.

**Tyram:** go.

**Ellis Taylor:** Um um quick question. How do we get

**Tyram:** Oh. Uh, we have to go. Well, the last time we went from

**Ellis Taylor:** there?

**Ali Leonard:** Do we have to go to the

**Tyram:** uh Yeah, we have to go to the tree, I guess. But does anybody know another extra dimensional portal we could use just to

**Ali Leonard:** train? That's a great question.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh. Um, well, I've been working on some stuff. We could give it a

**Tyram:** get Oh, yeah. That'd be really convenient because I don't want to have to go all the way back to Red's Village. Bad memories and all

**Christopher Hooper:** try.

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't even know who that

**Tyram:** That's true. You never met him. Oh. Uh, uh, you also probably have no idea what any of us are talking about, right? That's right. But

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, that that is.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, that's almost munching down on a

**Christopher Hooper:** is.

**Tyram:** anyway,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, you are correct. I I do not know who these people

**Tyram:** wait, have you been wearing a pirate hat this whole time?

**Walden Briarhelm:** are. Oh, no. That's uh you

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** ignore that. That was

**Ellis Taylor:** muffin.

**Ali Leonard:** Powerabanga.

**Tyram:** Well, it it seems like a weird choice is all, but anyway. Yeah. So,

**Luke Neverisky:** right. Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** nothing.

**Ali Leonard:** Georgia's Halloween costume.

**Tyram:** um uh Liliana, you remember all this from being in

**Luke Neverisky:** y

**Tyram:** like the back of Helga's mind,

**Luke Neverisky:** Hell's

**Tyram:** right? Okay. Um Right. So, um, during one of our misadventures, we went to a casino in another dimension. I had the greatest night of my life, but, um, we need to go there and, uh, help my girlfriend who is,

**Luke Neverisky:** obvious

**Tyram:** uh, apparently dealing with Helison's b*******. That's pretty much the long and

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, your little your honey boo, right? Or whatever

**Tyram:** short. It was five seconds ago. Get your head

**Luke Neverisky:** you call

**Ellis Taylor:** Honey Bear. Oh, he calls her honey lamb.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's

**Ali Leonard:** Honey

**Tyram:** together. That was it.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, she calls him Honey Bear or Sugar

**Ali Leonard:** lamb. Honey

**Tyram:** Yeah. Jugger bear and honey.

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** Bear. Yeah. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Taylor, you noticed that gold card that was in the envelope has started

**Tyram:** Yep.

**Ellis Taylor:** to kind of buzz a little bit, hum a little bit in your

**Ali Leonard:** lamb. It's

**Tyram:** Oh, all right. Well, I I picked like I kind of

**Ali Leonard:** a howler. Watch out.

**Tyram:** examine it to see if there's a any way I can like

**Ellis Taylor:** hand.

**Tyram:** uh like answer it or

**Ellis Taylor:** Um,

**Tyram:** something. Sure.

**Ellis Taylor:** so you do you want to do a little investigation check on

**Justin Hale:** This is

**Tyram:** Yeah. If that grabs my dice. Okay. Uh

**Ellis Taylor:** it? Okay. You see written on the front of the card, it says guest transport. It's dated today. Um, and it says 10:00 a.m. on

**Justin Hale:** all

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Tyram:** 15. What time is it now?

**Ellis Taylor:** it. And then underneath, um, I don't know, we'll say it's like 9ish by the time you got everyone up. 9 9:30. Um, and then there's some fine print underneath, but that's a little hard to

**Tyram:** Okay. Sorry.

**Ellis Taylor:** read. There's some fine print underneath that,

**Tyram:** What? Hey, uh Olivia, do

**Ellis Taylor:** but it's a little hard to

**Tyram:** you have like a magnifying glass in here

**Ellis Taylor:** read. Oh, yeah, she does.

**Tyram:** somewhere?

**Ellis Taylor:** She's got a monle actually that gives her advantage on investigation text. You can just

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** borrow

**Tyram:** Um, and I try to read

**Ellis Taylor:** it. Do you want to roll investigation again? Ironically, I did not have Olivia's character

**Christopher Hooper:** What's

**Tyram:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** sheet pulled up because I didn't think I was going to need it.

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, well, my investigation is actually really bad. if someone else wants to try to read it.

**Ellis Taylor:** or Olivia could try to read it for you. Sure, you take a look at it. You're

**Christopher Hooper:** happening? What are you looking at? You need me to take a look at

**Tyram:** Sure. Yeah, there's really fine print on here that I have

**Ellis Taylor:** probably better than

**Tyram:** a hard time

**Christopher Hooper:** something? Oh, yeah. That is fine print.

**Tyram:** reading. What does it

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Tyram:** say?

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia. Yeah. So, the fine print

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, I got a 19

**Ellis Taylor:** says, "All guests with a reservation to hold this card at the specified time for instant transportation to the

**Ali Leonard:** It's a

**Tyram:** That

**Ellis Taylor:** Lotus." It's a

**Christopher Hooper:** investigation.

**Ali Leonard:** porky. It's not a

**Tyram:** was super important. That should have been bigger on the cards. I think Marvin that

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Ali Leonard:** howler. I thought you were going to wear your glasses, Silus.

**Ellis Taylor:** party. All right. Well, it looks like we've got a little bit of time. If

**Justin Hale:** Oops.

**Ellis Taylor:** everyone wants to get back here with like five minutes to spare to gather anything you feel like you need, eat your snacks.

**Tyram:** part. All right. So, I guess we go through like a prep montage where like all of like a

**Ellis Taylor:** Uh yeah, we're all getting it out kitted out to

**Tyram:** Yeah, I zip up my Spider-Man hoodie. Um

**Justin Hale:** Just uh if you cut to Brew Bruce just talking to Pepsi, he's like,

**Ellis Taylor:** go.

**Christopher Hooper:** room.

**Ellis Taylor:** entire building. And in that laundry room waiting is the resistance. So Naam is going to be like, "All right, guys. Um I don't I know you know a couple of people. Actually, I don't know you, Mr. uh Turtle Man, but um I'm assuming you're with Sy. This is all cool. Um I guess I could just do a little introduction."

**Justin Hale:** anymore. No, he just shoved a he just shoved a gold card in our faces and

**Tyram:** No, I

**Ellis Taylor:** like Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, so like now it's not because Talisana's taken

**Justin Hale:** we ended up

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yeah. So Helison's kind of taken over

**Ali Leonard:** over.

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Ellis Taylor:** everything. The casino is like kind of still going, but

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** really she's

**Tyram:** didn't.

**Ellis Taylor:** like she's kicked out all the normal performances. Her ravers are just like going crazy. She's forcing us to go to these daily concerts. It's just absolute chaos here now. Like my son, my little baby Julius, he can't sleep at all. It's just so loud with all the partying. We really just um so the plan is we really need you guys to help us out. So we have a plan. I hope I'm hope you guys are ready for this. It's a little bit of a weird one. Um so not surprisingly something like this has happened before. Um Marvin

**Justin Hale:** Something very similar to this has

**Ellis Taylor:** the casino it's been taken over a couple of times.

**Justin Hale:** happened before.

**Ellis Taylor:** So Marvin Junior Jr. Junior's ancestor. They actually built in this kind of factory reset button

**Justin Hale:** Is it

**Ellis Taylor:** that well I think it was his like his

**Ali Leonard:** Cool.

**Justin Hale:** ancestor? Is that just

**Ellis Taylor:** great-grandfather when this first happened but Marvin's kind

**Luke Neverisky:** The Marvin Senior.

**Ellis Taylor:** of yeah Marvin Senior but Marvin's done a little of improvements because it

**Luke Neverisky:** More like Marvin

**Ellis Taylor:** has happened under his watch as well. Um and since I've been here this has happened before. So, there's a factory

**Justin Hale:** Marvin?

**Ellis Taylor:** reset button that will basically reset the magic of this place. So, anyone that's not like supposed to be here gets

**Luke Neverisky:** Senior.

**Ellis Taylor:** sent home and then the casino itself gets moved in space and time. Um, it's a little bit of a headache because we do kind of get cut off for a while. It's hard to we have to reestablish everything. But the the good thing is all the raers will be sent home. Helena will be sent home. even y'all will be sent home right

**Tyram:** Oh, well have to be sent home right

**Ellis Taylor:** away. And normally Marvin could just part of the magic, honey. I mean, um Marvin, normally

**Christopher Hooper:** should should you be raising a

**Ellis Taylor:** Marvin, it's got great benefits and

**Christopher Hooper:** child in this

**Ellis Taylor:** there's an entire like daycare facility that's part of it. It's honestly

**Tyram:** away.

**Ellis Taylor:** it's really nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** environment, okay? Cuz we have like a whole city. Just

**Ellis Taylor:** Um yeah, the one that's you're rebuilding. Yeah, that's not

**Christopher Hooper:** uh keep that in mind.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I got a good career here. I'm like kind of on upper management track. So, well, once we get everybody

**Christopher Hooper:** Are there

**Ellis Taylor:** out of here and it's back to normal, sure. But also, I mean,

**Christopher Hooper:** resistance? Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** I am kind of in charge of the resistance, too. Again, I am on the upper management track,

**Christopher Hooper:** Sorry.

**Ellis Taylor:** but okay. This isn't about my

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Sorry. I

**Justin Hale:** Oh, so by saving by sa No, I see what this is. By saving the hotel in the casino, that's how you get promoted. You're going to use that as leverage for

**Ellis Taylor:** career. You guys are reading way more

**Christopher Hooper:** I Oh, yeah. That's

**Ali Leonard:** I think right

**Justin Hale:** promotion. I I see what you're doing. This very This very

**Ellis Taylor:** into this than I intended. Okay. Any any All

**Christopher Hooper:** art. That's smart. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** smart. That's very

**Luke Neverisky:** He's just trying to build a resume. I get

**Tyram:** This place would already fall apart without her. She don't need to do

**Justin Hale:** smart.

**Tyram:** shenanigans. Got you,

**Ellis Taylor:** right. Thank you, Sugar Bear.

**Ali Leonard:** away, right?

**Justin Hale:** But it looks good on it look good on on promotion sheet.

**Ellis Taylor:** Uh, I'm not going to say no, but that's not why I'm doing this.

**Justin Hale:** Yes, I I got you. I got

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Tyram:** honey.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm trying to, you know, save everything. All

**Justin Hale:** it. Sure. Yes. Right. Right. Of

**Christopher Hooper:** It looks really bad right now and I bet she has to recover her

**Justin Hale:** course. I

**Tyram:** This is

**Ellis Taylor:** right. It's not What?

**Justin Hale:** see. Never mind.

**Tyram:** her

**Walden Briarhelm:** Do uh you you

**Christopher Hooper:** reputation.

**Walden Briarhelm:** mentioned something about the reset button.

**Ellis Taylor:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I mean

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. So, the reset button, normally Marvin could just do it on his own, but

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** Helisana's uh kidnapped him and incapacitated

**Tyram:** fault.


### [00:40:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** him. Um, but before when she first got here, before s*** super hit the fan, Marvin told us that he had given the key to his most trusted employee, which we cannot for the life of us figure out who that was, and they have not come forward. So, what we really need for you guys to do is without Helisana figuring out, she doesn't know this key exists. She doesn't know this button exists. We need you to find the key and get down to the basement level where the reset is and re use the key to reset the

**Tyram:** Oh, is new Helisana's lack of knowledge of resistance of

**Ellis Taylor:** lotus.

**Tyram:** logistics would be her

**Luke Neverisky:** you definitely. Yeah, we I we didn't really pay attention to that geography and

**Tyram:** undoing. Oh, Naomi. Um, I don't know. I guess introductions.

**Luke Neverisky:** logistics in school. wasn't

**Ellis Taylor:** it also there's there's a couple of problems with

**Ali Leonard:** wouldn't send Alana to the

**Ellis Taylor:** that. Um, first off, our magic doesn't work like that. It's just to and from the casino. And then after the rest gets hit, the

**Christopher Hooper:** ocean.

**Ellis Taylor:** casino kind of gets shut down for a long time. Um there's no in-n-out while um

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Ali Leonard:** barge.

**Tyram:** Well, if the casino is going to be shut down for a while, do you want to maybe come visit in our realm for a bit then

**Ellis Taylor:** yeah. Um I

**Luke Neverisky:** That's so

**Ellis Taylor:** have to get out of here before the reset happens. And um it depends.

**Ali Leonard:** How long are you trapped

**Ellis Taylor:** It depends on how much the magic we have to fix and reset. So there's really no knowing until

**Christopher Hooper:** Who? How else?

**Ali Leonard:** here?

**Luke Neverisky:** sweet.

**Ellis Taylor:** we honey.

**Christopher Hooper:** How do we bet on

**Ellis Taylor:** That is a you problem. That is not a me problem or here

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia's backing you

**Ali Leonard:** into those youths if you teach about

**Luke Neverisky:** Well,

**Tyram:** session. Let's leave it behind for

**Ellis Taylor:** up.

**Christopher Hooper:** her. All right, I'll find

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** another way to to place a few bets on that. For now, let's learn more about

**Tyram:** now. Are all of your characters going to be like

**Christopher Hooper:** this problem at the library. You right behind

**Tyram:** ineterate gamblers?

**Christopher Hooper:** you.

**Luke Neverisky:** What's it say about

**Tyram:** Toeer. It does seem to be a constant in

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Justin Hale:** It's the easiest flaw for cover to to

**Tyram:** these little personas you

**Christopher Hooper:** What other persona has been a

**Justin Hale:** build. Do you do

**Luke Neverisky:** him?

**Tyram:** create. Aar lost all his money within like five minutes of the last time

**Justin Hale:** you have something that you need to tell

**Tyram:** we were

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** gambler? Oh,

**Justin Hale:** us? Yeah. Do you is there something that you're trying

**Christopher Hooper:** maybe.

**Justin Hale:** to tell us that you just you're trying to speak through your characters about? Is this

**Christopher Hooper:** Listen, I never gamble at all in real life. So,

**Justin Hale:** a is this an elaborate cry for

**Tyram:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** in fantasy world, I'm going to spend some money like it ain't

**Justin Hale:** help? So in

**Christopher Hooper:** mine.

**Justin Hale:** the in the fantasy world, you're a terrible gambler. All

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Let the AI record show that Toeer has a gambling

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** Oh, okay. So, I

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I can't wait for that to pop up in there somewhere.

**Tyram:** I saw the the eight was a B there. Like one boob. It's off. What the f***,

**Justin Hale:** One boob. ET

**Tyram:** Zack?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** is off. f****** ET. ET is

**Luke Neverisky:** problem. That's the plastic surgeon,

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's That is the hardest I've left. Thank you

**Justin Hale:** crazy these

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Tyram:** What the

**Walden Briarhelm:** for that. One

**Tyram:** hell are you

**Walden Briarhelm:** boob. You just read

**Justin Hale:** days. Just one. Only

**Tyram:** saying?

**Walden Briarhelm:** and leak still. That's I I feel you

**Ellis Taylor:** What? 8

**Justin Hale:** one.

**Walden Briarhelm:** completely, man. Boob. It's off. Sorry, I've derailed

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** us.

**Ellis Taylor:** Z85. All right. So, honey, there is no library. What we need is we need to find the key and then we need to hit use it to set the button. Hit the button.

**Justin Hale:** off.

**Ellis Taylor:** That's on track. Marvin does not have

**Christopher Hooper:** And Marvin has the

**Ellis Taylor:** the key. Marvin said that he left it with his most trusted employee, but no one has come forward and we

**Tyram:** Wait, when his most trusted employee

**Ellis Taylor:** cannot figure out who it

**Tyram:** should obviously be

**Ellis Taylor:** is. I know that is what you would think,

**Tyram:** you, man. You are your

**Ellis Taylor:** but I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** key.

**Tyram:** talents are wasted on Marvin, honey. I mean, he doesn't

**Ellis Taylor:** know.

**Tyram:** appreciate. I am.


### [00:50:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** You're going to try and talk her into leaving.

**Tyram:** Yes. Yeah. That's gonna be

**Ellis Taylor:** Especially cuz she's got to get cut off from you for who knows how long. I

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe Silus can stay

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. That's so sad.

**Tyram:** sad. Well, yeah. Okay. I'll just roll with a

**Ellis Taylor:** know. Byebye,

**Tyram:** new character,

**Christopher Hooper:** here. He ends up being Chalk

**Tyram:** but no. Oh, I I'll I'll roll with a character

**Ellis Taylor:** Taylor. Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** Rock. That'd be great.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh my

**Tyram:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** god.

**Tyram:** like. All right. Okay. So, we got

**Ali Leonard:** god.

**Tyram:** to find the key, get to the room, hit the button, and uh find some way to establish a way for you and I to talk while you're trapped here. Got it. You got it,

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, yes.

**Tyram:** honey. All right. So,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Tyram:** uh where do you know where all the employees are? Do you have like a do you have any like candidates for who might be his most trusted employee?

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, it's a bit of a mixed bag. Half of us are under hell. Oh, not half, over half of us are on Helisana's thr right now. I mean, this

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** room is I know. Seriously, this room is pretty much everyone I trust, but none of us have it. So, the room is like, like I said, Spike Fison and his

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** two goons, uh, but not Fufu. Uh, and a few other random employees. Um, I can listen. There's uh Carl from maintenance. He's just like a very old kermaginly man who the thr doesn't do anything on. Um, there's Liliana and No, not Liliana. Sorry. Lily and Laya from must be okay. Lily and Lana from the M from the spa. And then I I couldn't find the name of the bartender you guys talked to, but what was he was he had a British voice. I couldn't find it. What's

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, now this isn't some like him being a schmuck and like his most trusted employee is like it's not like behind like a portrait of him or something, is

**Ellis Taylor:** going I I

**Luke Neverisky:** no. Oh, that's clever.

**Tyram:** it? He seems like the type

**Ellis Taylor:** mean we didn't think of that But it doesn't seem like

**Tyram:** of prick who would do that.

**Ellis Taylor:** Marvin. He's not the kind He's not really the kind to stroke his own ego.

**Tyram:** Sorry, but

**Ellis Taylor:** He's very humble kind of

**Tyram:** most of my memory of him is of him accidentally roofing us.

**Ellis Taylor:** guy. I mean, yeah, he's good. I know it's hard.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, drug dragging us for sure. For sure. For

**Ellis Taylor:** He's He's surprisingly competent in many ways. Potions, he is just It's a passion, but he's not good at it. He keeps

**Tyram:** So

**Ellis Taylor:** trying, though. I mean, he does have a real good understanding of magic. Um, I mean you guys can roll insight if you

**Ali Leonard:** sure. Most interested

**Ellis Taylor:** want to try and like deduce what you think about him. Scarlet who hasn't

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes, there was some

**Ali Leonard:** employee.

**Ellis Taylor:** met

**Ali Leonard:** Just from these

**Christopher Hooper:** insight.

**Tyram:** Uh, I got a 20 on

**Ellis Taylor:** him. Oh, okay.

**Tyram:** insight.

**Ellis Taylor:** Scarlet got 28.

**Justin Hale:** Are we all rolling in

**Luke Neverisky:** Nothing.

**Ellis Taylor:** Jesus. if you

**Justin Hale:** sight? Guess it won't

**Ali Leonard:** stories. It could

**Justin Hale:** hurt. Oh, wow. Okay,

**Luke Neverisky:** I did

**Ellis Taylor:** want.

**Ali Leonard:** hurt.

**Justin Hale:** that was that was a good

**Ellis Taylor:** Jeez. So, we got a

**Tyram:** Damn, we're

**Ellis Taylor:** 20, a 21, a

**Tyram:** insightful as

**Ellis Taylor:** 28. Doesn't know s***. Which makes sense because you weren't

**Luke Neverisky:** not.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I rolled a

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** roll.

**Luke Neverisky:** No.

**Walden Briarhelm:** four. I rolled a one.

**Ellis Taylor:** there. Ally, did you say something?

**Tyram:** s***.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Well, with so Brew, Silus, and Scarlet just from being around and listening to everyone. You guys know, are you guys kind of deduced that you know that Marvin, while pretty incompetent with potions, he actually does know a lot about magic. Um, and he would know that like he needs the key to go to someone who won't go under Helisana's thrral and is someone who is pretty, you know, well trained and is a good

**Tyram:** So is it

**Ellis Taylor:** boy. It's poo poo. Ally, you got that so fast. So, yeah. You think

**Tyram:** foo?

**Ellis Taylor:** the key is with

**Tyram:** Okay, there's only Yeah, that There's makes sense. only one person who uh wouldn't have the, you know, wherewithal to turn in the key by this point. Yeah, that makes sense. All right, so we got to get into that magic

**Ellis Taylor:** Fufu? Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** So

**Ellis Taylor:** F. I did not even think about that. Makes so much sense. Um, all

**Tyram:** show.

**Ellis Taylor:** right. Well, David is gonna go on. David is going to go on and show starts in about 10 minutes. If you could like, but Foo is kind of in the middle of the act. So, if you could get in there before Foo goes on

**Luke Neverisky:** fun.

**Ellis Taylor:** stage. I don't know. Maybe it's in his cage. Maybe it's on him. I don't

**Tyram:** Oh man, I hope he didn't eat it. All

**Ellis Taylor:** know.

**Tyram:** right, let's go

**Luke Neverisky:** Okie

**Tyram:** team. Oh, I thought that

**Ellis Taylor:** So you

**Justin Hale:** calm down,

**Tyram:** was Scarlet going. We like, okay, it's that's a character choice.

**Ellis Taylor:** guys, what did Scarlet roll

**Luke Neverisky:** dokie.

**Ellis Taylor:** 26 for?

**Justin Hale:** Kevin.

**Ellis Taylor:** Don't worry about it. Just

**Christopher Hooper:** We

**Ali Leonard:** just for

**Ellis Taylor:** revives.

**Ali Leonard:** vibes.

**Tyram:** Okay. Okay. Um, so are there like ravers like

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Tyram:** causing mayhem in the hallways or

**Ellis Taylor:** What? Yeah, there are ravers all over the place, but they are kind of keep they're they're causing mayhem. They're not like attacking everyone. They're more attacking the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** establishment and the man because there is a st a fair

**Ali Leonard:** Hell yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** mix of like especially of employees and guests

**Tyram:** anything?

**Ellis Taylor:** who are still there but they can't leave so they're kind of like working around the chaos or mostly sticking to their rooms. Um but I need to know what you guys are doing if you're sneaking. I mean you're very familiar from the

**Ellis Taylor:** down, the door, the elevator doors open and you go into this

**Luke Neverisky:** honestly.

**Ellis Taylor:** kind of like dimly lit room and at the other end of the room is a single door. And next to the door is this base of this kind of like bowl of water. And as you walk up to the door, you guys see some symbols carved into the

**Tyram:** Is it in a language any of us can

**Ellis Taylor:** wall.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, what kind

**Tyram:** read?

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, I need you all to do history

**Luke Neverisky:** of

**Ali Leonard:** good.

**Walden Briarhelm:** studying.

**Ellis Taylor:** Ma. Well, all righty. And let me go to our chat. So, this is a picture paste. This is the symbols and ma you instantly recognize it as your native Aquan

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh yes, it's so

**Ellis Taylor:** language. And above it and what what it says

**Walden Briarhelm:** obvious.

**Ellis Taylor:** is ask me to

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hey, uh I think

**Ellis Taylor:** proceed.

**Walden Briarhelm:** we are supposed to maybe ask the door or the bowl of water if we may proceed. Uh it does not

**Luke Neverisky:** What is it?

**Walden Briarhelm:** specify but the bowl of water seems to stand out as a unique feature. Perhaps we should speak to the door uh to the pool of

**Tyram:** Do you maybe speak to it in whatever language that

**Walden Briarhelm:** water.

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh. Uh, yes, of course. Uh, do I just do it? Let me

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean try

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** is

**Walden Briarhelm:** see. Yeah, it's a language I

**Ellis Taylor:** you. So yeah, when you try to say when you try to say a sentence in your native language, nothing comes out of your

**Walden Briarhelm:** know.

**Ellis Taylor:** mouth. And you know that ever since you've left your underwater village, city, I'm not sure where you're from. Whenever you've wanted to speak your language, nothing's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Interesting. Okay. I'm trying. Okay. So, I think I understand your puzzle, but my my intelligence is only a 10.

**Ellis Taylor:** happened.

**Justin Hale:** And I and I climb up on Elma's back and like push his head towards the

**Tyram:** It's also true

**Walden Briarhelm:** Um, that sounds

**Tyram:** that 10 doesn't mean you're an

**Walden Briarhelm:** better. No, but I don't know that

**Justin Hale:** water. It would stand a reason that you if this is a language that you speak, you probably know you can

**Tyram:** idiot.

**Walden Briarhelm:** he I would think so. I like

**Justin Hale:** only speak it

**Walden Briarhelm:** yours though. Yours is much funnier. Like as as you're crawling up on my shoulder,

**Justin Hale:** underwater. Sure, that's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I kind of turn just a little be like, "Oh, do you have an

**Tyram:** I'm justing you just like kind of like crawl on his back and then just do like an

**Walden Briarhelm:** idea?" As I'm sitting up there, I'm like,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** RKO and like pull him into the

**Walden Briarhelm:** "Oh, out of

**Justin Hale:** fine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** nowhere." Oh,

**Tyram:** Nothing.

**Ellis Taylor:** vibrating next to them and everything kind of

**Justin Hale:** Our

**Ellis Taylor:** starts starts pulling apart to where you can

**Justin Hale:** dead.

**Ellis Taylor:** things to trip you

**Christopher Hooper:** puzzle.

**Ellis Taylor:** up. This would have been over

**Christopher Hooper:** But

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Bruge genius was just too That's

**Ellis Taylor:** like Yeah, I was actually

**Justin Hale:** Hey,

**Ellis Taylor:** planning on like dropping a puzzle because I thought you guys were going to take so long

**Ellis Taylor:** doing stuff, but you figured out food really quickly. You did

**Tyram:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** some great roles.

**Christopher Hooper:** through yeah, a lot of people contributed. I didn't, but a lot of

**Justin Hale:** burden. Those were abnormally high

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, no. I I I was the anti-contribution

**Christopher Hooper:** people did.

**Walden Briarhelm:** today. Think I rolled a two and two

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like you contributed.

**Justin Hale:** averages.

**Walden Briarhelm:** ones.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah. You did the water

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, you did the water thing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the first time I have in since you guys were my uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** first D&D exposure. That's the first time language I think has come up in a character for me almost ever.

**Justin Hale:** yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Like I've always like I just never see language is being used and now

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, me too. I

**Tyram:** Well,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm like oh well it's that simple. You

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** I was curious if a lot of you were going to remember your languages, but you rolled so well. I was like, well, I'm

**Tyram:** mean,

**Walden Briarhelm:** just did

**Ellis Taylor:** just going to tell him he knows his

**Tyram:** language is always always just like necessarily has to be something the

**Walden Briarhelm:** have it

**Ellis Taylor:** language.

**Tyram:** DM very purposefully includes, right? So, do we level

**Luke Neverisky:** Wait some

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. A lot of

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Hell

**Luke Neverisky:** time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** before. You get all the things from the bag of lies.

**Ellis Taylor:** puzzles.

**Tyram:** thank you. Hell yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, thanks.

**Justin Hale:** worthless. Yeah, that was

**Luke Neverisky:** there. Thanks for bringing us back to the

**Tyram:** So next week we want to try to do the uh the

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Justin Hale:** fun.

**Ellis Taylor:** tried. Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** Ellis. Sounds good to

**Justin Hale:** next week.

**Tyram:** heist. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** Uh, yeah, I think that's fine. That's not when I'm out, right? No,

**Luke Neverisky:** loading.

**Tyram:** Oh, well in that case we should do it next week

**Walden Briarhelm:** Let's

**Justin Hale:** it's the week

**Tyram:** so that you'll be there for

**Christopher Hooper:** me. Do you want people

**Justin Hale:** after. Yeah, because the week after that I'm

**Tyram:** it. I do New

**Christopher Hooper:** who Oh, yeah. In uh

**Justin Hale:** playing D and D for a

**Tyram:** Orleans.

**Christopher Hooper:** New Orleans. Yeah. For those who don't

**Justin Hale:** week. Yep. Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** have uh names yet in your gang, should we come up

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. Um we'll probably like

**Christopher Hooper:** with

**Tyram:** uh give you guys I guess whatever homework you're going to have to do um now and then. Um, I'm wondering if we should like

**Walden Briarhelm:** do

**Tyram:** just like just handwave it or if like we should do a thing where

**Christopher Hooper:** some?

**Tyram:** like Silus and Brew um a wizard comes by and zaps them with magic juice and they're like six levels higher than they should have been when this

**Ellis Taylor:** Maybe

**Tyram:** happened. Probably just handwave

**Ellis Taylor:** they're trapped in a dream world and having to relive

**Tyram:** it. Well, if you guys want to um roll up third

**Ellis Taylor:** it. Oh my

**Tyram:** level

**Ellis Taylor:** gosh. What if um Crowley comes back and you're having to relive

**Justin Hale:** Yes, f******

**Tyram:** characters,

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's

**Tyram:** no, I think I think it I don't think we need to over complicate it. I think we just need to make

**Walden Briarhelm:** pretty

**Ellis Taylor:** this?

**Justin Hale:** growling.

**Tyram:** it. It's just a memory. It's just something that it's as it happened before.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. It's just an ammo.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Um I do have some plans for Crowley and that's not part of it. So, I don't want to like

**Walden Briarhelm:** cool.

**Tyram:** she warned that in. Okay. But yeah, and Ally is going to do a like a race or something, I think, at one point. Something she said,

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Oh, that'll be

**Tyram:** right? All right. So, that leaves uh Luke and uh Zach, you slackers need

**Ellis Taylor:** fun.

**Tyram:** to I guess come up with whatever you're going to

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. And Justin,

**Tyram:** do.

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Or are you co-deming?

**Justin Hale:** I assumed you were DMing this. I was just helping you with

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Tyram:** Yeah, we can do that. Yeah. Yeah, you can. Yeah, fine. That that

**Justin Hale:** it. I can I can DM something else.

**Tyram:** that's cool. I I'll DM it next week. Um and you and I can uh collaborate on what we want the heist to look like. So

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice.

**Justin Hale:** there. You guys You guys want me to bring back the

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice.

**Justin Hale:** super depressing

**Tyram:** Okay. I mean, I guess

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, of

**Justin Hale:** god? The chaos

**Tyram:** the only stipulation here is it needs to be like a flashback or something that

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** makes sense to do while we're in H High Forge,

**Justin Hale:** god.

**Tyram:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I mean it doesn't have to be an eye forge. It can be

**Tyram:** Or sure, like or something we could have done during our

**Christopher Hooper:** regional.

**Tyram:** downtime month

**Walden Briarhelm:** course.
