**Justin Hale:** Open it. It like fans out to show the

**Christopher Hooper:** When you open it, it like fans

**Walden Briarhelm:** I thought it was a flash

**Justin Hale:** lead. Yeah, it looks like it. It looks like a stick of gum. And then it

**Christopher Hooper:** out. Don't put it in

**Justin Hale:** has charcoal black

**Christopher Hooper:** your

**Justin Hale:** erasers refills. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** computer.

**Justin Hale:** crazy. It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** drive. So all

**Christopher Hooper:** Put in your

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, it's

**Justin Hale:** crazy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that reading of books, you just had to just start writing one. Is that what this

**Luke Neverisky:** crazy.

**Justin Hale:** No, I I decided to be extra for D

**Walden Briarhelm:** is?

**Christopher Hooper:** computer. Hi

**Justin Hale:** and D and I bought a little Sue Catch book that I then turned into my D&D character sheet and all my

**Walden Briarhelm:** All

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, wow.

**Justin Hale:** all my stuff for it. So, I just keep notes

**Christopher Hooper:** Thanks.

**Justin Hale:** in this little catchy book. So, I've got my obnoxiously expensive little notebook and my

**Christopher Hooper:** Chef

**Justin Hale:** obnoxiously expensive little pencil to go with

**Walden Briarhelm:** right. I love that for

**Justin Hale:** it. Because, you know, why

**Walden Briarhelm:** you. Your notes are going to be explosive. They're going to be the

**Tyram:** Is this starting to sound disturbingly like the conversation in the movie American Psycho where they're talking about

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Business

**Tyram:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah. Oh my

**Luke Neverisky:** cards. Yeah. Oh, f***. I love

**Justin Hale:** not

**Walden Briarhelm:** bomb.

**Christopher Hooper:** god. Look at that mechanical

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** The way the text is indented slightly, you can feel it with your thumb

**Christopher Hooper:** pencil.

**Walden Briarhelm:** as you rub across it.

**Justin Hale:** I'm going I'm going crazy in my little basement

**Walden Briarhelm:** Very nice.

**Justin Hale:** hole, guys. I'm going

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm

**Walden Briarhelm:** channeling your inner

**Tyram:** I mean, it was only a matter of time once you moved to

**Justin Hale:** crazy. Is that

**Tyram:** Ohio that just people inevitably go insane.

**Justin Hale:** right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** brew. That sounds

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** right. Isn't Ohio like

**Tyram:** Yes, it's a well-known fact about

**Walden Briarhelm:** mostly Is it mostly forest or did I make that up? cuz I drove through it once and it was

**Justin Hale:** That's pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** like just woods and interstate.

**Christopher Hooper:** sure. That doesn't sound

**Tyram:** Ohio. Well, I mean the part if you're just going on

**Christopher Hooper:** right to me. Is that

**Justin Hale:** wood.

**Tyram:** the interstate, it's disproportionately going to go through wooded areas. That's true of

**Walden Briarhelm:** I was thinking like cuz it was main interstate all your

**Tyram:** basically everywhere.

**Walden Briarhelm:** main cities would have been somewhere around and it seemed like it was

**Tyram:** I

**Walden Briarhelm:** just always

**Tyram:** mean, the part of the interstate that goes through the city is always a

**Walden Briarhelm:** trees.

**Tyram:** relatively brief part of the

**Justin Hale:** Ohio is the only

**Walden Briarhelm:** How much of Ohio is forest?

**Christopher Hooper:** real?

**Justin Hale:** place I've ever seen black

**Walden Briarhelm:** 30 to 35%. So, no, not as much as I

**Tyram:** interstate. I

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't think you're supposed to say

**Luke Neverisky:** their

**Justin Hale:** squirrels. You know, I really don't know what I would say

**Walden Briarhelm:** thought. Are you a

**Tyram:** was thinking I making a joke about it, but like Yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** color. I don't

**Tyram:** I suppose you wouldn't, would you,

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Luke Neverisky:** see color for

**Justin Hale:** otherwise. I I have seen them called

**Tyram:** Justin? You and your prejudiced

**Justin Hale:** squiggas online and that got that one

**Walden Briarhelm:** racer? Oh my god,

**Tyram:** mind. Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** us.

**Justin Hale:** got I was like, "Holy s***, that's wow, that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** that's AI don't

**Tyram:** no. I'm impressed by your restraints. Not calling them that

**Justin Hale:** good." Those were crazy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** translate. This is

**Luke Neverisky:** No, this is

**Justin Hale:** They're uh they're like

**Tyram:** yourself.

**Justin Hale:** crazy

**Walden Briarhelm:** America. Our property

**Christopher Hooper:** Simple.

**Walden Briarhelm:** has a tree that's dead, but it won't fall. Like the top broke off of it, and it is a squirrel metropolis. We have got

**Luke Neverisky:** how

**Walden Briarhelm:** every color. I have not seen a full albino

**Justin Hale:** furry.

**Walden Briarhelm:** though. We've seen brown with per or brown with black tails and black with brown tails which are supposed to be really strange phenotypes. No albinos. I'm hoping one

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe if you if you stay right with God,

**Walden Briarhelm:** day. That's it. That's it. Raise

**Christopher Hooper:** you'll see an albino No squirrel one

**Walden Briarhelm:** up. I love

**Justin Hale:** crazy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. Like the furthest I think I can get from specifically Christianity would probably step away from

**Christopher Hooper:** day. I was um I I really like the idea about the atheist in a D&D world where like gods are like manifested and like will will actually like perform actions and you have people that are like

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** superpowered from their belief in like their god and it would just be funny to

**Walden Briarhelm:** The opposite

**Christopher Hooper:** be like h that's all fake.

**Justin Hale:** Would atheism at that point

**Walden Briarhelm:** of the paladin.

**Justin Hale:** be god denial or would it be like god smiting like oathbreaker paladin style?

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, I think that's a different type of belief because because atheism is that you don't

**Tyram:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** believe that God

**Tyram:** which yeah, that would be rather difficult when there is just

**Christopher Hooper:** exists.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, right. Right. It's not

**Walden Briarhelm:** There's a nubis walking down the

**Tyram:** tangible proof that they

**Justin Hale:** really It's not really denying the existence. More

**Luke Neverisky:** Unless

**Justin Hale:** so like purposely ignoring their

**Tyram:** do.

**Justin Hale:** existence.

**Tyram:** I feel like that would be more the equivalent of being a Satanist where like you're

**Luke Neverisky:** there's

**Walden Briarhelm:** street.

**Tyram:** not denying that they exist, you're just directly opposing

**Walden Briarhelm:** This is a fun

**Luke Neverisky:** Or I guess in the world hopefully magic and s*** one could say like someone

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** them.

**Luke Neverisky:** could play mental gymnastics to say no it's just an illusion or that's just magic that's not

**Tyram:** Yeah, I guess that's fair that like you could just say like, "Oh, well that was

**Luke Neverisky:** der

**Tyram:** fundamentally the same as what a wizard does only like you

**Justin Hale:** Okay, that would be fun.

**Walden Briarhelm:** part.

**Tyram:** know, I could see that. I

**Justin Hale:** That would be

**Tyram:** guess although if you got a powerful enough cleric, they can actually have like direct divine intervention, which I feel like would be more difficult to chalk up to

**Justin Hale:** Trigger the lights. Trigger the lights.

**Tyram:** wizard magic.

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe maybe an atheist

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** could believe that they are just like a born sorcerer or they're like a

**Tyram:** Maybe

**Luke Neverisky:** Hey, like major illusion exists.

**Tyram:** um it kind of reminds me of like mo like like Christmas movies where like Santa

**Christopher Hooper:** wizard.

**Luke Neverisky:** It's all

**Tyram:** is one of the characters and yet there are people in the movie who don't think Santa is real. Like that doesn't make any sense. Like who do you think is leaving these presents out every Christmas if you don't believe that Santa is real in this fictional world where he is very much a real person, you

**Luke Neverisky:** tough.

**Christopher Hooper:** You like looking at the people? Yeah.

**Tyram:** know?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Nope. I was talking

**Luke Neverisky:** I was enjoying it. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh Ben Ben Smith and I are still in touch. I don't know if you talked to him at all. Uh he has been writing for the last uh like nine months to a year his

**Christopher Hooper:** Hello. Okay, let's talk

**Luke Neverisky:** got

**Walden Briarhelm:** lore bible. So he wrote like it's

**Christopher Hooper:** about something.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a what do you call that when you believe in multi-gods? There you go.

**Luke Neverisky:** Not the opposite of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Polytheistic Bible. So it is a world set in a place where all the religions kind of like weave into each other and they wrote one like mega bible.

**Tyram:** polytheism.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, he sent me a 200page document of what he's written. And I'm like,

**Luke Neverisky:** mono.

**Walden Briarhelm:** "Holy like, I I got plenty of time. I'd love to sit down and read it, see what he's got." He said, "Today was the day he woven Christianity." And he was like, "It was hard. Like, Christianity stands out as the weirdest one of the others. It just doesn't want to plug and play like the others

**Tyram:** Well, yeah. Monotheistic religions are completely

**Walden Briarhelm:** do. I'm I haven't gotten to read

**Tyram:** incompatible with polytheistic ones, you

**Justin Hale:** Come

**Walden Briarhelm:** it yet, so I'm curious what his twist is, but like that's his passion is coming up with crazy lore for his

**Tyram:** know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** campaigns.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, one time when we were together at uh Bonding

**Justin Hale:** on.

**Luke Neverisky:** in 2020 three I think. Um

**Justin Hale:** Awesome.

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah, he went on he like talked to me for like two hours about this like campaign in this world and

**Walden Briarhelm:** So yeah, it's it's his passion project

**Luke Neverisky:** things he's made up. I was like,

**Walden Briarhelm:** for sure. I think he also does the thing where he has been a DM who's been

**Luke Neverisky:** "Damn, did you

**Walden Briarhelm:** paid. So maybe that's maybe it's more than just

**Luke Neverisky:** uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** passion. What were you going to

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Uh have you joined his he has a Discord for his

**Walden Briarhelm:** ask? She invited me like

**Luke Neverisky:** like TTRPG thing he's making or

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** 6,000 years ago and I just forgot. It's

**Luke Neverisky:** something?" Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** like years ago. That's a

**Walden Briarhelm:** there somewhere. Yeah, Discord

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** travels. I rounded down slightly, I

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** guess. Yeah, some

**Luke Neverisky:** It's a couple

**Justin Hale:** long discord. the uh the one true Magna

**Walden Briarhelm:** zero errors. Yeah. How are you doing, Toeer? I see you still have Babby is guest DMing or Oh, you're double muted on your double

**Christopher Hooper:** We are close. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** login.

**Justin Hale:** Carta. Don't you lie to

**Christopher Hooper:** but not yet there yet. Don't you lie

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. I

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** to

**Walden Briarhelm:** mean, we're starting

**Tyram:** I mean, let's not are we there yet, Toeer. I mean, he'll let

**Walden Briarhelm:** Are we uh are we starting like a new

**Tyram:** us know when he's

**Walden Briarhelm:** act tonight as we enter Graport or are we wanting to wait for

**Christopher Hooper:** me. We already started a new

**Tyram:** ready. We started the new act last week.

**Luke Neverisky:** That was the

**Christopher Hooper:** app.

**Walden Briarhelm:** everybody? Oh, okay. I guess I was thinking that was the end and

**Luke Neverisky:** start when we

**Walden Briarhelm:** now we're going somewhere new. But you're right. We did enter the gates because I recall Taylor gave that cool uh display that was in the main entrance. Yeah, I guess we did.

**Luke Neverisky:** went.

**Justin Hale:** Have fun with my disabled

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, if if y'all want to go

**Justin Hale:** dog.

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead and review what we had last time, we actually did a


### [00:10:00]

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I remember reading the the summary and I

**Christopher Hooper:** lot. Hey.

**Tyram:** Although the

**Luke Neverisky:** forgot I was like, "Oh, right. We did that that week,

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh.

**Tyram:** summary was incorrect on some details,

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. Let's point those out now.

**Tyram:** but oh well. But but Oh, well, sure. All right.

**Luke Neverisky:** too.

**Tyram:** Um, okay. So, um

**Luke Neverisky:** It's a little

**Tyram:** we started off last time we were still like in the uh rebuilding um High Forge. Um apparently Ellith's god Tony um has uh established a presence now. There were uh there were believers who uh kind of have integrated Ellith into their number a little bit at least

**Justin Hale:** Thank you.

**Tyram:** like she was introduced to them at least.

**Luke Neverisky:** dirt.

**Tyram:** Um, you guys are uh learning to make pizza

**Walden Briarhelm:** Six.

**Tyram:** apparently. Uh, f****** uh Chalk Rock is thriving and I kind of hate it. Like he's got a Patrick Warbertton voice and he's like, you know, just like the strutting around town and I I am glad that we are out of his presence because I could not stomach how well he's doing right now. Um but um

**Christopher Hooper:** Live out loud.

**Tyram:** yeah, um Brew and Silus though uh they discovered um amongst Helga's journals that um apparently the uh leader of our old gang, Thrander, his corpse was not amongst the bodies of uh the Cisphus circle. And so, um, yeah, we, uh, we needed to get to Greyport to see if we could pick up the trail. Um, and also we need to get to Greyport to, uh, deal with the dragon orb, which, um, I think the, uh, journal said that it was like the order of soft paws, which it's St. George if I remember correctly. How the

**Christopher Hooper:** He really struggled with

**Tyram:** hell

**Christopher Hooper:** St.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, maybe that's why I missed things because I just felt like

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. They also tried to say if their sander had the orb, which

**Luke Neverisky:** hallucinations were

**Tyram:** is also not true. I have the orb.

**Christopher Hooper:** George. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** real.

**Tyram:** Um, but whatever. Um, anyway, so yeah, um, we all decided to head out to Great. We had to leave the Ford F-150 behind, which I can only assume Toeer implemented as a a party

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** balance measure because clearly we weren't losing ever again with the Ford F50 on our side. Um, but we still have the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Bugatti and we still have uh there's some I think there was some discussion about whether we needed to rename the Broomfall now that uh now that uh Helisana is not part of the party, but I think we

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** We could just

**Tyram:** decided to keep the name.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah.

**Justin Hale:** call it the broomfall instead. BRU. Just name all of

**Tyram:** Um maybe it's just the Brew

**Justin Hale:** our vehicles after me. Now I get to turn

**Tyram:** Fall. the Bugatti and the Brewfall.

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Justin Hale:** until

**Tyram:** I don't know. I mean, I'm I'm not against it. We can put that up to a discussion.

**Christopher Hooper:** You could try to have Leiana be the front for

**Tyram:** Um, oh man. Oh, actually, if we ever want to

**Luke Neverisky:** all

**Tyram:** lure out Helisana for a confrontation, that should

**Christopher Hooper:** Doomfall.

**Tyram:** be how we do it. Like, we introduce uh Liliana

**Christopher Hooper:** a

**Tyram:** as like the new face of uh Doomfall, and

**Christopher Hooper:** concert. Oh.

**Tyram:** she that would piss off Helisana so much. I'm sure that she'd come out

**Luke Neverisky:** You

**Tyram:** and like confront us. Okay, so put that in our back pocket. Um

**Luke Neverisky:** f****** That's

**Tyram:** anyway, um Scarlet told us also that um she needed

**Christopher Hooper:** Uhhuh.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** some of the reality stones from Red's old village to put some of the finishing touches on the uh the pocket village that we had been working on for so long. Um so yeah, we decided all to uh to head out to uh Greyport. Oh, and also we need to go there because uh Ma's moon goddess apparently fell into the sea somewhere near

**Justin Hale:** The

**Walden Briarhelm:** my moon

**Justin Hale:** moon goddess.

**Walden Briarhelm:** goes. I didn't know if

**Tyram:** there. Is that not what I

**Walden Briarhelm:** there were more. That was my only thought was that there were other potential with the fake moon. Just

**Tyram:** said? I didn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** curious.

**Tyram:** say whatever. Um, oh, and uh, finally, we do have Jasper's, uh, bakery, brewery, and bakery thing. Probably not in that order that we needed to cash in. So, yeah, we had lots of reasons to go to Graport. And, uh, yeah, we headed out that way. We took the detour over towards uh, uh, not Melstrom. Um, I forget what the Goliath village was

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. Oh.

**Tyram:** named.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah. I don't think we talked about I'd have to look it

**Tyram:** whatever. Um, we went there and apparently those f****** from Elderan were uh mining stuff from the village somehow. They were feeding into a machine. My best guess is they were teleporting it uh to either their moon base or maybe to Elderan or someplace. Uh, whatever they were doing, we were not having it because whatever they're doing is just automatically something that

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Tyram:** we want to oppose. Um, so yeah, we blew up their machine. Uh, Ellit pushed one of them through the machine. It apparently severed his legs, so he's probably dead, but yeah, f*** him. Um, Ma was able to run into the uh the stockpile of reality stones and grab like 500

**Christopher Hooper:** It's not leing it.

**Tyram:** pounds worth and we were able to stuff those into the pee hole.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's working.

**Tyram:** And uh so yeah, we should have all that we need to finish the pocket village now hopefully. Um, which a few days did pass between then and us arriving at uh Graport. Do we have an opportunity to finish the pocket

**Justin Hale:** Is

**Tyram:** village? I don't know. Hope will tell us, I'm sure.

**Justin Hale:** Grim the right name?

**Tyram:** Um, say

**Justin Hale:** Grimvar the Goliath.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um.

**Tyram:** what spine was the mountain path that might I don't know if it was that

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh. Oh, Grimvar Spine. That's

**Tyram:** or

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Yeah. Let me look it up for you.

**Tyram:** not. feel like it had like a very Nordic

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Tyram:** sounding.

**Christopher Hooper:** Voscar. That's what it

**Justin Hale:** Uh,

**Tyram:** Okay. But we hate everyone who lived there. So, I don't know. It's

**Justin Hale:** cool.

**Tyram:** maybe not something that we our characters would even care about, but um anyway, so yeah, we did finally arrive in

**Christopher Hooper:** was. And one of these days I'm going to make a

**Tyram:** Grayport. It is

**Christopher Hooper:** political entity y'all really

**Tyram:** yet to happen. I mean, well, I I feel like we're pretty cool with the people

**Christopher Hooper:** like.

**Tyram:** currently um running uh High Forge and I feel like we have uh we have friends in Red

**Christopher Hooper:** You literally just told me you hate the

**Tyram:** Brook. s***, that's right. Everyone besides him with though. Is he the Is he officially the mayor

**Christopher Hooper:** mayor.

**Tyram:** now? Damn

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Oh, so you like Grim

**Tyram:** it. All right, never mind. and High Forge can go f*** itself

**Christopher Hooper:** Jaw.

**Tyram:** now. Um, I don't know. Maybe we'll run into the leadership of Greyport here and we'll be cool with them. I don't know.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm I need to really probably need to cross out

**Tyram:** Um, but I mean,

**Christopher Hooper:** some character features of

**Tyram:** actually, I think about it though. Um, as players, I'm sure we're all excited to be back in Great Port, but all of our characters had

**Christopher Hooper:** theirs.

**Tyram:** extremely traumatizing events happen there. So, I don't know how thrilled they are to be back

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** there. Pilots Brew and Ellit at least all had

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Tyram:** terrible experiences last time they were

**Christopher Hooper:** race. Yeah, I guess um Liliana didn't have a great experience around

**Tyram:** here. I think Didn't we say Liliana's never been here

**Christopher Hooper:** hereish. Uh her family home is near but not here maybe. Is that right,

**Tyram:** before?

**Luke Neverisky:** near here. Yeah, we said Helisana when she was touring didn't I don't think her

**Christopher Hooper:** Luke?

**Luke Neverisky:** fame made it to Greek court. Yeah, but you're right

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And's

**Luke Neverisky:** to near. Yeah, adjacent.

**Walden Briarhelm:** just

**Christopher Hooper:** dead god is like around here, too. So, that's not great

**Walden Briarhelm:** chilling.

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, I mean like I feel like the the god who

**Luke Neverisky:** Let's

**Tyram:** apparently is alive is what we heard is like that's actually seems like a source of hope for Ma rather than a source of

**Christopher Hooper:** either. Oh, yeah. Even.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Maybe I'm the only one who will walk out of Great Port with a good story. We'll

**Tyram:** trauma. Who's to say? Well, any of it though. So,

**Luke Neverisky:** jump.

**Tyram:** um Oh, and then the very last thing that happened was we walked up to the uh the bakery, brewery, bakery of Jaspers and we ran into

**Walden Briarhelm:** see. While Toeer's away, can somebody give me a bit more background on their sander?

**Tyram:** Theirander. there. Sander was the character that Ally played during the flashback episode. Um, he was the leader of the Sisphus circle. Um, and he's a dwarf, I believe. And, uh, yeah, I guess that's pretty much the long and short of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Was he a character from the previous

**Tyram:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** campaign? Okay. I didn't think

**Tyram:** No, he was the, uh, he was from Silus

**Walden Briarhelm:** so. Got it.

**Tyram:** and Brew's background.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Perfect.

**Tyram:** You have played exactly as much time with the character as

**Walden Briarhelm:** Every time we talk about Graveport, I tend to be

**Tyram:** the rest of us

**Walden Briarhelm:** a little like I don't know who is an old character or what is old lore. So that's my hesitation.

**Tyram:** have. Um, old characters from the uh old campaign. Um, Gary's still alive somewhere. I don't know if he's in Greyport or not. Um, Justin's old character, Shield, is still alive, but does not currently live in Graport. Um, you already met Alli's old character, Caspian, who does not currently live in

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.


### [00:20:00]

**Tyram:** Greyport. Um, my old character, Fluke, is dead, so

**Luke Neverisky:** Joel.

**Tyram:** he's not around, but his shop should still be around. And his dragon, Iro, I think we established, is running it. I actually have a uh a oneshot idea for that. So, uh, I guess pin in that for now.

**Walden Briarhelm:** A dragon runs the shop. I love that. I don't know what it

**Tyram:** Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** means, but I like it out of

**Tyram:** yes. Uh, Fluke ended up with a dragon egg

**Walden Briarhelm:** context.

**Tyram:** which hatched and uh, and imprinted upon Fluke. Now, dragons are super smart, so I don't know how permanent something like imprinting would be, but um, I will go ahead and tell you that he still runs Fluke shop. He does think of Fluke as his dad. And for that matter, I would say he also thinks of Gary and Shield as his older

**Luke Neverisky:** Gosh, I've

**Tyram:** brothers. Well, you got

**Luke Neverisky:** always wanted a dragon

**Tyram:** one

**Luke Neverisky:** brother. He gets top bunk. f*** that s***.

**Justin Hale:** Pop's the one we

**Christopher Hooper:** Perfect.

**Luke Neverisky:** Actually

**Justin Hale:** fight

**Luke Neverisky:** doesn't true

**Christopher Hooper:** All right, I'm

**Tyram:** Hell

**Luke Neverisky:** actually.

**Christopher Hooper:** ready. Zach's in a new

**Walden Briarhelm:** Excellent.

**Justin Hale:** over.

**Christopher Hooper:** room. We already talked about

**Walden Briarhelm:** Just a different

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Yeah, you're in a different

**Walden Briarhelm:** room. It's just It's just a different room.

**Luke Neverisky:** We're

**Christopher Hooper:** room happening.

**Walden Briarhelm:** There's a thermostat.

**Luke Neverisky:** very much happy with our

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I Justin usually travels his whole house

**Luke Neverisky:** backgrounds.

**Christopher Hooper:** but ends up in his basement and Taylor I think is in his room every time but always uses the coffee shop as his

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** I do, I guess.

**Luke Neverisky:** There's

**Christopher Hooper:** background.

**Luke Neverisky:** always the clouds brewing thing. You can kind of see

**Christopher Hooper:** What? Oh, is this like IDs from conferences and

**Luke Neverisky:** it. Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** stuff? Oh, yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** there's also that. But behind that is the clouds brewing thing. You can see

**Tyram:** I can't say it from this angle, but I am uh glad to know that it's

**Luke Neverisky:** it. Yeah. It's

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Justin Hale:** heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** there. It's a comforting presence in these trying

**Christopher Hooper:** so I believe we left off the last thing

**Tyram:** times.

**Christopher Hooper:** you saw was their Sander at the bakery and it looks like he was uh he had a nice baker's apron on.

**Luke Neverisky:** always

**Christopher Hooper:** Um he was carrying a huge uh bag of bread and it looks like he was um setting up the shop uh refilling some stocks uh as you're walking down the street and um and he's uh and let's see. Y'all are heading down the main throw affair and at some point he makes eye contact with Silus and Brew and he says, "Hi guys." And then the bakery explodes. Um, I would

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, but the

**Christopher Hooper:** like you all to make a dexterity saving throw.

**Justin Hale:** What's uh

**Tyram:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** what's happening

**Christopher Hooper:** So, um,

**Tyram:** f***.

**Luke Neverisky:** bread.

**Christopher Hooper:** so for this dexterity saving throw, the DC, um, the DC is 17,

**Tyram:** What?

**Justin Hale:** here?

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, to do kind of like a a basic save. You'll still take a little bit of damage. If you beat 17 by five, you'll take no damage and you'll have a little bit of a extra time to to move react. Uh you'll take kind of the the first spot. Um and if you do less than

**Justin Hale:** Whoops.

**Christopher Hooper:** five, uh you'll have some consequences. And if you do even worse than that, then you have uh even worse consequences. Um, okay. So, let's see. Um, we'll do you first. So, you had uh you did not get within five. So, you will receive the full uh 86

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, good

**Christopher Hooper:** damage. Good

**Walden Briarhelm:** start. Good start.

**Christopher Hooper:** start. Um, except

**Walden Briarhelm:** bottom left corner. The

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** to get it. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** little Oh, you mean all across the whole side.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. So, you receive um 19. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** see. Same for you, uh, Brew with that nine. Let's see. With the 13, that puts you within five. So, you luckily only receive um that 19 damage and you're set prone. And oh, Taylor uh beats it

**Walden Briarhelm:** Heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** um but not enough to get the the the the good stuff. So, you're only going

**Tyram:** Well, I do have evasion. So, if I'm saving

**Christopher Hooper:** to Okay, cool. So, you'll just you won't

**Tyram:** for half, it means I save for full instead.

**Christopher Hooper:** get that little bonus reaction piece, but you'll uh you'll only get half the damage and then half and then uh none. Cool. So, you have just seen they the bakery has just exploded. It looks like um well, let's see. Does anyone want to do anything uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** What's that?

**Christopher Hooper:** that? Oh, and Brew, you are deafened. So, all of this is like

**Tyram:** here. Oh, can I think it at him with Can I establish psychic phone

**Luke Neverisky:** Huh?

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't think you know he's

**Tyram:** and think it at all of

**Christopher Hooper:** defined on their Sander. Um unless you have another reason uh that wouldn't be

**Tyram:** them? All

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Tyram:** right. Okay. Um I guess um as soon as I have a reason to piece together they're not coming to help, maybe I'll establish a clone. But

**Christopher Hooper:** case. Um yeah, I think right now you're Let's go

**Tyram:** sure, not

**Christopher Hooper:** back to you. Um so you find their uh their

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** stander. He is gashes. He was right next to this explosion. Uh, lots of wounds here. Um, what are you going to try to do

**Tyram:** Um, I'm trying to see if I have like a heal potion or anything

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Oh,

**Tyram:** in my inventory. I do have a potion of healing

**Walden Briarhelm:** Nice sleep.

**Christopher Hooper:** full potion, but it looks like he's stabilized uh for the

**Tyram:** Okay, I'm going to try shouting out uh for help again. Um, is there anything I can do

**Christopher Hooper:** moment. Well, let's jump

**Tyram:** to like clue into the fact that they're not hearing

**Christopher Hooper:** phase. Um Liliana, you see that Ma and Brew

**Tyram:** me?

**Christopher Hooper:** like they can't really hear you. They're you're like trying to yell at them, ask if they're okay. Um, and they are both showing they're like not uh hearing you at

**Luke Neverisky:** Do they do you

**Christopher Hooper:** all.

**Luke Neverisky:** guys know sign language? because they have no sign

**Justin Hale:** I'm just

**Luke Neverisky:** language. Crying this time like are you

**Justin Hale:** like right back at you, buddy.

**Christopher Hooper:** Doubt. Uh uh Silus

**Luke Neverisky:** okay? That's

**Christopher Hooper:** in that that case you want to give me an insight check here.

**Luke Neverisky:** rude.

**Christopher Hooper:** Insight or perception either one is

**Tyram:** Sure. I'll go with

**Christopher Hooper:** fine.

**Tyram:** uh my insight is better. All right. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um you kind of gather that it

**Tyram:** 20

**Christopher Hooper:** seems like uh the explosion was loud enough that they they probably can't hear you right now and that's why none of them are following following

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** you.

**Tyram:** Can I uh see them from where I am? Do I need to be able to see them to do psychic

**Luke Neverisky:** Excuse

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, I think yes and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sorry.


### [00:30:00]

**Tyram:** phone? Okay. Oh, if I can see them, I'll uh I'll go ahead and uh activate psychic phone. All right. So, we got that going on for

**Christopher Hooper:** yes. All

**Tyram:** uh 7

**Luke Neverisky:** me. Nice.

**Tyram:** hours. Okay. So, I'll think at them. Hey, um anyone who can walk right now, I got their Xander here. They're stable,

**Justin Hale:** Your

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** but I need to get them out of this rubble.

**Justin Hale:** voice is the only thing I can hear and I think that's more troubling than anything

**Walden Briarhelm:** I think I am dead. What is

**Justin Hale:** else.

**Walden Briarhelm:** happening? You are talking to a man with brain.

**Tyram:** I'm going to need you guys to get your s*** together sooner

**Walden Briarhelm:** Um, I am a

**Tyram:** rather than later

**Luke Neverisky:** I'll do

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I see what you did there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** bit

**Tyram:** here.

**Luke Neverisky:** fine.

**Justin Hale:** That's pretty,

**Tyram:** Big guy, you're the one who's best equipped to dig this dig us out of this rubble. I really need your help right

**Justin Hale:** man. All right, I'll get up if you need me that

**Walden Briarhelm:** shocked. I I will do my

**Justin Hale:** bad.

**Walden Briarhelm:** best.

**Luke Neverisky:** I I think he meant I think he

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, I I do want to see this. I

**Luke Neverisky:** meant

**Walden Briarhelm:** need a moment to get up. Brew, let's see what you've

**Tyram:** now.

**Justin Hale:** sure. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** got. Sound of a wick sparking up as he

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh no.

**Walden Briarhelm:** grabs some

**Justin Hale:** right. Just start unfoiling my debt cord.

**Walden Briarhelm:** dynamite. What? What has happened? You seem to know Silus. What is happening?

**Tyram:** Um, I there was a f****** explosion. I I don't know much more than that right

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Is everybody else okay? Where

**Tyram:** now. Okay, I've

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Tyram:** got someone here who I want to make sure survives this because my goodness, this would be the worst reunion I have ever had. I have had some bad

**Luke Neverisky:** All right. Well, where are you, Marco? Oh, wait.

**Walden Briarhelm:** everybody?

**Tyram:** ones. I can see

**Luke Neverisky:** Can I see him?

**Justin Hale:** I like Marco Polo

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, Silus,

**Tyram:** you.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Marco is even

**Justin Hale:** better.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm going to give you an action before I uh do something

**Luke Neverisky:** better.

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Um, can I like assess like what is uh keeping me from moving through Sander right

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, you see with that insight from earlier, um you see it looks like he's pinned under um the door actually blew out like on top of him and it looked like it actually protected him from a lot of the worst damage, which is why he's not dead right

**Tyram:** now?

**Christopher Hooper:** now. Um but it's like a heavy door that's like on top of him right now.

**Tyram:** Okay. Is there like anything I could use as like

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** a is like a wedge and like a lever here or anything like

**Christopher Hooper:** why don't you give me a perception

**Tyram:** that?

**Christopher Hooper:** check? Oh, 16. Great.

**Tyram:** Okay. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you see, uh, if you were to jump into

**Tyram:** 16

**Christopher Hooper:** the frame, uh, into the flames, there's one of those like long pizza like shovel things, you know? Yeah, long pizza paddles. Um, but it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** like made of like iron. Um, and uh, uh, it looks like it's like right inside the doorway, but it is like

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***.

**Justin Hale:** pizza. Iron

**Christopher Hooper:** within the flames right

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** pizza paddle be counterproductive? Like wouldn't it get

**Christopher Hooper:** now. I feel like

**Justin Hale:** hot? It

**Christopher Hooper:** that's what I've seen.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, they're metal

**Justin Hale:** wouldn't get

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I mean, you don't leave it

**Tyram:** Um

**Luke Neverisky:** peels. The handle.

**Christopher Hooper:** in.

**Tyram:** Okay. But if it's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, not

**Tyram:** in flames, I'm guessing it's red hot right

**Justin Hale:** hot.

**Christopher Hooper:** yet. All right,

**Tyram:** now. Okay. In that case, I'll try to get to it before it becomes

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Give me um athletics or

**Tyram:** so acrobatics

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** all

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, if you can uh

**Justin Hale:** Can

**Christopher Hooper:** acrobatics. Yeah. You want to do

**Tyram:** day. Um

**Luke Neverisky:** never

**Justin Hale:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** something? Can I?

**Tyram:** 23

**Justin Hale:** I want to stand up and immediately assess the surroundings. see if

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes.

**Justin Hale:** there's anybody like running away from the scene or uh if there's an immediate obvious

**Luke Neverisky:** mind

**Justin Hale:** like trying to get away with it

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yeah. Give me a perception check. Um, so that 23 uh what was it? Acrobatics or athletics? Acrobatics. Um,

**Justin Hale:** situations 20

**Christopher Hooper:** you are Oh,

**Tyram:** Acrobatics. I can boost if you need me

**Christopher Hooper:** that's very good. Very good. Um, so Silus, you're you like like this s*** is

**Tyram:** to.

**Christopher Hooper:** falling down and you're able to dive through the the opening and grab the pizza paddle, sling it through um and then jump uh barrel roll through like kind of like a gymnastic

**Justin Hale:** Baby, arrow

**Christopher Hooper:** uh tumble um gracefully

**Justin Hale:** roll.

**Christopher Hooper:** and you're able to uh start leveraging uh using that as a lever to start lifting up the door. Um, right now it's taking both of your hands. Um, you're you're probably going to need help uh to to drag their sander

**Walden Briarhelm:** H I think this is where Elmo would step in and while the paddles like lifted up be like I think that I am

**Christopher Hooper:** away.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the necessary help you need and like I don't I don't even know I have the gloves of all strength so

**Christopher Hooper:** I think even without those you are you can definitely drag a body away. Um I think with your what's your strength at 25?

**Walden Briarhelm:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, it is very easy for you to very delicately like lift this unconscious body up um like a little

**Walden Briarhelm:** 125. I'd like to imagine I'm also

**Christopher Hooper:** baby.

**Walden Briarhelm:** with one finger on the other hand that's free like trying to get some dust out of my

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, for

**Walden Briarhelm:** eye while I just pick him up and walk.

**Justin Hale:** 30

**Christopher Hooper:** sure. Yeah. You're just cradling him one hand uh like a like a tinder little baby. Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. Oh, yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Brew uh Nat 20. What is the

**Justin Hale:** 30 plus

**Christopher Hooper:** total?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Heat.

**Justin Hale:** 10 perception

**Christopher Hooper:** 30. You see a lot. You see,

**Justin Hale:** baby into the

**Christopher Hooper:** firstly, it's almost like the fact that you're

**Tyram:** Bam.

**Christopher Hooper:** deafened allows your eyes and your brain to be like a little stronger connection here.

**Tyram:** Oh man, he's becoming inverse

**Justin Hale:** kind of cut up. I'm trying to

**Christopher Hooper:** Um um so there's the obvious stuff. People are like running away screaming. It's but

**Tyram:** daredevil.

**Justin Hale:** see. Yeah, people just running away

**Christopher Hooper:** like you can't hear the scream so you just hear

**Justin Hale:** with weird silly faces. This What a bunch of

**Christopher Hooper:** like Yeah. Yeah. And Yeah. Yeah. covered in ash. Um you see people like trying to crawl away from the

**Justin Hale:** idiots.

**Christopher Hooper:** debris. Um a few like roasty roasties uh in the midst. Um, and it's just at that moment you would just the timing of when you looked up and started surveying. That's when you see some figures moving moving from the back of the building out to a little little alley. They don't

**Justin Hale:** Hey.

**Christopher Hooper:** look they don't look like they're scared. They look like they are just orderly moving. And you see that they are in like knights armor. Um, and they appear to have these dragon skull emblems on uh the the back of their armor. And they are walking um into this alleyway and that's the

**Justin Hale:** Um, I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** and then that's it. That's the last you see

**Justin Hale:** I'm going to pull out a trick that I have yet to do.

**Christopher Hooper:** them.

**Justin Hale:** Um, can I tail them with crimson and see through crimson's

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Justin Hale:** eyes? Because crimsons is is fine, familiar, and I just keep him around all the time.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. Yep. Go ahead. Um, so, uh, what what is what is

**Walden Briarhelm:** What?

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Uh, it's a little um like cardinal. He's a little cardinal

**Christopher Hooper:** crimson? Oh, right. That's right. That's right. Um, yeah. So, Crimson the Cardinal uh takes flight and starts following them. What's the range on

**Justin Hale:** bird like

**Christopher Hooper:** Crimson? Like, no. Like,

**Justin Hale:** speed.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, how long can you follow their their sight?

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I don't know. I've never used this before.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, why don't you look that up? Uh, anyone else want to take a turn here? Uh, we've got Ma cradling Sander away as Silus lifted up the door. Um, Liliana, what are you doing here right now? Um, other folks are kind of moving around you. Uh, what are you

**Luke Neverisky:** Um the Sander

**Christopher Hooper:** doing?

**Luke Neverisky:** um how does he is he is he really really beat up or is he looking

**Christopher Hooper:** He looks

**Luke Neverisky:** like post administration of the potion? How is he

**Christopher Hooper:** pretty beat up still. Uh it looks like he had all he had

**Luke Neverisky:** looking?

**Christopher Hooper:** like his arms are like burnt up. His body is just like battered. Um so he's it looks like he's like he might have some like internal like abdomen stuff going on. Um, and he's got like severe burns on his arms. Um, he's not bleeding. He's stabilized. Uh, but he he's in pretty rough shape and he's unconscious at this


### [00:40:00]

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Um, all my So, I'll um I'll try to like meet up with Ma and Sander on the way there. Are there any like uh from the explosion? Are there like fires and s***? I'm guessing there

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** are. I'm gonna on my way over there, I'm going to pew pew, press the ditation to try to extinguish some of those smaller

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. Okay. Gotcha.

**Luke Neverisky:** fires. At

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, give me um Why don't you give me a spellcasting

**Luke Neverisky:** least I can do

**Christopher Hooper:** roll? Um, if you want to really extinguish the fire, I might ask for some spell

**Luke Neverisky:** that. Okay, I'll I'll invest. So, I got a 19

**Christopher Hooper:** slots. Okay, that's great. I think

**Luke Neverisky:** on my spell on my spell attack

**Christopher Hooper:** if you give me um either like two level ones or one level two, like you're able to put out this

**Luke Neverisky:** roll. Yeah, I'll put out two level ones. Um, and then, um, when I get to Oman to Sander, um, I'll give the sander a a cure wounds as

**Christopher Hooper:** fire. Okay, cool. And um let's see. Does cure wounds does it? So it gives him HP. Yeah. So he he it hits him almost like an adrenaline shot like,

**Luke Neverisky:** well.

**Christopher Hooper:** "Oh my god, what where am I? Where am I? Oh, a

**Luke Neverisky:** It's okay. This is a friend of

**Christopher Hooper:** turtle."

**Luke Neverisky:** um Silus. Just just enjoy the

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus. Who's

**Walden Briarhelm:** I've got

**Tyram:** That's me. I

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus? Bartleby.

**Tyram:** say I kind of like I guess run to the group.

**Luke Neverisky:** ride. No, that's Silus. I don't know. He's He's in shock still. It's

**Tyram:** It just it let it go. I I I

**Luke Neverisky:** fine. Just Just

**Tyram:** go by silence these days. Hey

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, hey. Hey. Oh my god. You should I thought you were dead. I thought I was dead. Hey, we got to get out of here. Uh, do you all have a safe place to go? Uh, oh

**Tyram:** boss, we just got

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I was hoping

**Christopher Hooper:** s***. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** to get some of your bread. Oh, smell

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Uh, so I've been working with these dragon people and uh I think maybe if we go to their place they could help us

**Tyram:** here.

**Justin Hale:** There you

**Christopher Hooper:** out. Okay. And uh

**Tyram:** U lead the way.

**Luke Neverisky:** delicious.

**Justin Hale:** go.

**Christopher Hooper:** he starts pointing um around um and uh Justin um did you see what your range was for your

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. 100

**Christopher Hooper:** familiar 100 ft.

**Tyram:** Um

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So, um they uh

**Justin Hale:** ft.

**Christopher Hooper:** once they get in their alley, it looks like they start um jogging and with that natural 20 perception 30 total, you see they are chasing uh another group and uh your your cardinal is basically like getting this like aerial view of this chase that's going on between the two. Um, and you're now getting this other perspective of

**Justin Hale:** Thanks.

**Christopher Hooper:** your friends moving through that alley, but then they take instead of the right, they take a left and they're basically like heading another direction. Um, and you now see that it looks like uh the the two groups are headed uh looks like they're chasing each other uh deeper into the city uh towards um the the northern part of the city uh where the old like university and like wealthy people were up there. Um whereas it looks like your friends are walking um towards the the docks the uh

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Um, I'm going to thank out to uh Silus and uh and say I think the people that did this are going to the universe to decide. I'm going to chase them around. Uh, and then I'm going to leave the view

**Christopher Hooper:** harbor

**Justin Hale:** of Crimson and start like keep tell Crimson to keep tabs on them and then to just I'm going to follow Crimson through the sky like just looking at

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay,

**Tyram:** Hold on, Brew. We probably need to stick together. Um I uh say over I I think of the others I say first of

**Justin Hale:** following

**Tyram:** Sander Bruce Taylor the ones who are who did this we need

**Christopher Hooper:** gotcha.

**Tyram:** to we need to back him

**Luke Neverisky:** Okie

**Tyram:** up. Oh

**Luke Neverisky:** dokie.

**Tyram:** um could um Olivia and Ellsworth take uh their Sander to the safe place while we

**Christopher Hooper:** That's a good idea.

**Tyram:** chase the bad guys?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah, we'll say they do that. Um you toss them off. Um he's like, "Oh, oh, hello." Um, and you'll

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, as I walk away though, I'm going to turn around and throw Sander and be like, "Not how I pictured our reunion going, but it's good to see you

**Christopher Hooper:** start jury's still out on seeing

**Tyram:** again."

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Well, uh,

**Tyram:** Fair enough.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, be careful out there. These are dangerous

**Tyram:** So are we. And I turn around and I'm gonna go

**Christopher Hooper:** people. Nice. Um, all right, y'all. Uh, catch up to

**Tyram:** with probably the most badass thing Silus has gotten to say

**Justin Hale:** Damn. There's a thing that Silus practices at

**Tyram:** so far in

**Justin Hale:** in

**Tyram:** the I mean we've established that like not

**Justin Hale:** bed.

**Tyram:** just Silus but a lot of people in the party practice these like cool like moments like putting on sunglasses for explosions and

**Justin Hale:** That's fair. True.

**Christopher Hooper:** Brew.

**Tyram:** stuff.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, very cool. Very cool.

**Justin Hale:** Fair.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, okay. Um, so you see, um, you Brew is trying to to keep up with the cardinal. Um, it's pretty

**Luke Neverisky:** Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** difficult. Um, why don't you I think you're going to need a survival check for this. Um if if we can have one leader um whoever's best at it, if you

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** if you whoever wants to lead can um and others like help um let me

**Tyram:** Um, would would we be able to do this better from the rooftops? Okay, everyone jump in the pee

**Luke Neverisky:** probably.

**Justin Hale:** probably.

**Christopher Hooper:** know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Zanimar.

**Tyram:** hole. And I uh with my spider climb

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Tyram:** ability, I'm just going to walk up the wall to a rooftop and um let

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool.

**Tyram:** everybody out once we're on top and just move across the

**Christopher Hooper:** I like it. I like it. Take uh inspiration for that.

**Tyram:** rooftops.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um Okay, cool. Let's get a

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** group uh athletics or acrobatics.

**Tyram:** Do we all have to do the same?

**Christopher Hooper:** No.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Come on, big

**Tyram:** Okay. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** 28.

**Justin Hale:** 12.

**Christopher Hooper:** Good. 12. Two

**Walden Briarhelm:** money.

**Christopher Hooper:** 12ves. Not so good. And

**Tyram:** 28

**Justin Hale:** Hey, 212 is a

**Christopher Hooper:** 25. That's true. But it also means the other one is a

**Justin Hale:** 24. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** Can we go

**Luke Neverisky:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** zero.

**Walden Briarhelm:** back to how you got 24 out of 212s? That's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't know,

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's a real stunner for

**Tyram:** I assume he just

**Luke Neverisky:** 12*

**Walden Briarhelm:** me. Oh. Oh s***. That's why

**Tyram:** said 12 +

**Christopher Hooper:** man.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I got confused. use their own

**Luke Neverisky:** 2. It's math. Math is

**Justin Hale:** mean, I think we're someone else's

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, I I did not mention this, but um

**Justin Hale:** money.

**Christopher Hooper:** this campaign is using the same map that we are

**Tyram:** 12.

**Luke Neverisky:** hard.

**Christopher Hooper:** familiar with. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** math. Oh. Oh, see, I should have known. I didn't know if we had the same order

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Good to

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I it's it's not dagger

**Walden Briarhelm:** of operations. My My

**Luke Neverisky:** know. No, it's you want you want to assume

**Christopher Hooper:** heart math, so we're it's the same.

**Walden Briarhelm:** bad.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um so, uh yeah, and Silus are are doing great. Um but you do at some point see Liliana and and Brew kind of struggling. Um so you're having to go back and catch them. Uh you're you're beginning to lag a little bit. Um, let's see. Anyone who wants to give me a perception

**Tyram:** Can more

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Tyram:** than one person do

**Justin Hale:** Oh my

**Tyram:** it? Uh

**Justin Hale:** gosh, that was a net one.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Oh,

**Tyram:** 18. You can reroll

**Justin Hale:** Oh yeah. Oh, all right.

**Christopher Hooper:** no. Oh, nice. Wow. All

**Tyram:** those.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Uh, so you went from the worst to the only one that passed the

**Justin Hale:** 21. Nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** DC19.

**Justin Hale:** I'll take

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, so, um, you are basically the only one that clocks it before anyone else does. But, um, it looks like you have company

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** on the roofs. Um there are um let's see with that 20 uh you

**Justin Hale:** like chasing us or or just also on the roof

**Christopher Hooper:** have

**Justin Hale:** like going in the same


### [00:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** what you clocked that they you uh you see that they're headed in the same direction. They're on like a convergence

**Justin Hale:** direction.

**Christopher Hooper:** course with you. You have uh one action before they see

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Fireworks. I'm I'm throwing Roman candles or bottle rockets at

**Christopher Hooper:** you. All right. All right. Um let's see. What are you trying to do here? Like uh like catch him like while they're transitioning buildings or

**Justin Hale:** them. Yeah, that sounds great.

**Christopher Hooper:** something?

**Justin Hale:** just explosions right in their

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, give me um give me something you want to roll for

**Justin Hale:** way.

**Christopher Hooper:** that. What do you think you would do? What What do you think is

**Justin Hale:** Um, I may just be able to do a spell. I guess I have I have

**Christopher Hooper:** that? Oh, you want to do a spell,

**Justin Hale:** pyrochnics, which is essentially I guess what I'm going for

**Christopher Hooper:** huh?

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Would it benefit you if you were thrown up into the air to make said magic spell happen with better visual and aim?

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh man, I hope the answer's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Maybe even considered

**Christopher Hooper:** yes. Yeah. You want to tag team

**Walden Briarhelm:** advantage.

**Christopher Hooper:** this? Um, cool. Why don't

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** y'all uh Well, have you decided um what kind of

**Justin Hale:** Yes. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** check you're thinking here? Uh

**Justin Hale:** I'll leave it up to you. If we do it as the fireworks pyrochnic spell, it's a con save. Otherwise, we could just flavor

**Walden Briarhelm:** yeah.

**Justin Hale:** it as like I'm throwing fireworks at them. Like legit fireworks at

**Luke Neverisky:** Thanks.

**Christopher Hooper:** Justin. Okay. In that case, why don't you give me a spellcasting um check and

**Justin Hale:** them. Spell

**Christopher Hooper:** Omo give me an athletics

**Justin Hale:** casting check. Is that just my spellcast mod or a spell

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Justin Hale:** attack?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yes. So, there's like uh Yeah, give me a a a spell

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Okay. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** attack. Is that a strength roll or an athletics

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. Oh, sorry. Athletics.

**Justin Hale:** plus that's a 2 + n. So 11.

**Christopher Hooper:** roll? Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** But do you have advantage from me throwing it so

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I don't know. What did you

**Walden Briarhelm:** far in the air to

**Christopher Hooper:** roll?

**Walden Briarhelm:** see or

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, okay. It says strength roll. I didn't know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** 26? So yeah, I I

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay. Um, so,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I know brain well.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, he he tosses you and normally it's kind of throwing you off, but also you have such a better, um, perspective that it's pretty easy to hit them from how far up he is throwing you. Uh, and you manage just as like a there are six of them and you hit as two are like crossing over and right about the jump and they end up like like falling into

**Justin Hale:** Hello.

**Christopher Hooper:** the building instead of making the jump that the other four um you're as they fall like between the buildings and the other four now turn to you. Um, you in that moment see uh these are you see the the tattoo of the iron claws on them. Um, and they now see you uh in your group. Uh, and they

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** are now changing course and heading directly towards you. One of them uh shoots

**Justin Hale:** heat.

**Christopher Hooper:** a fireball at your group. Um, I need you all to make a

**Justin Hale:** Aren't they supposed to be good

**Christopher Hooper:** dexterity saving throw.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, I don't

**Tyram:** just the ones in high for I assume. remember the journals hinted that like uh Helga's mom was

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***.

**Tyram:** like probably the head of like some

**Justin Hale:** now?

**Tyram:** ironclaws in her own right, you know. So I'm Yeah, I think we're

**Christopher Hooper:** know.

**Tyram:** uh we're feuding with Helga's mom now is what I assume. Um uh

**Christopher Hooper:** 21. Good. Um, you're going to need a a a

**Walden Briarhelm:** I was too busy focusing on brew in the air. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** DC15 X

**Walden Briarhelm:** why my exit is bad. Sorry.

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Tyram:** 21

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. So, uh, who we got? So, if you made it, um, so if you did not make the DC-15, you take half of 19, which we round down to, uh, what? Uh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Go

**Christopher Hooper:** nine. Nine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** ahead.

**Tyram:** either nine or 10 if you're feeling how depends on how you're

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so, uh, if you made the save, you only get nine fire damage. If you failed the save, you get the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** full 19 fire

**Walden Briarhelm:** So,

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** damage.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I have I I have a thing that I just wanted to verify. It's a

**Tyram:** feeling.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a class feat or a a species trait, which

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Christopher Hooper:** where when you're jumping between buildings and someone

**Walden Briarhelm:** um that

**Christopher Hooper:** casts a fireball on you, um you actually uh it bounces off you and go back to

**Walden Briarhelm:** one.

**Tyram:** The

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. How'

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's

**Tyram:** game designers thought it was too specific, but they decided to include it anyway.

**Luke Neverisky:** you know?

**Justin Hale:** I think it's called the I'm rubber your glue

**Luke Neverisky:** Just in

**Justin Hale:** feet.

**Christopher Hooper:** them. Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** exactly I I have

**Tyram:** But but only for jumping between

**Walden Briarhelm:** I Yeah, you have to be in midair. I have a evasion when subject to

**Tyram:** buildings.

**Walden Briarhelm:** an effect that allows you to make a deck saving throw to take only half damage,

**Tyram:** That's a

**Walden Briarhelm:** etc. I Yeah, I was I was

**Tyram:** monk thing, not a turtle

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** unders all I thought it was a species trade. It's a class feature. So

**Luke Neverisky:** case.

**Christopher Hooper:** So you have evasion just like

**Walden Briarhelm:** in this particular case, so

**Tyram:** thing.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah, all the uh all the dexi classes tend to get it. I think rangers get

**Walden Briarhelm:** half. So just to be clear then I would take nine not

**Tyram:** it,

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus. That's right. Purely from

**Walden Briarhelm:** 19 purely because of evasion.

**Tyram:** too.

**Christopher Hooper:** evasion. Um, cool. What are people's health at

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** right

**Walden Briarhelm:** So important.

**Tyram:** Thanks to invasion, I've avoided damage so

**Justin Hale:** forward.

**Christopher Hooper:** now? Nice. All right. Well, let's keep going.

**Tyram:** far. Are we in

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, no. Um, but you can feel free to if you want to

**Luke Neverisky:** Huh?

**Christopher Hooper:** act, you can

**Tyram:** initiative? Okay, the one who uh threw the fireball at us, how close are

**Christopher Hooper:** act. Uh, they're pretty close.

**Tyram:** they?

**Christopher Hooper:** Probably 30 ft. Like one building

**Tyram:** Okay, I want to uh try

**Christopher Hooper:** over,

**Tyram:** to uh teleport behind them and stab

**Christopher Hooper:** teleport behind them, and stab them. I love it. Okay. Yeah, go

**Tyram:** them. Okay, so

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead. So

**Tyram:** I'll use Misty Step for this one. Use my free one, you

**Christopher Hooper:** beyond just damage, um what are you trying to do

**Justin Hale:** Go.

**Tyram:** know. Um I really am just trying to kill this guy. Um I think

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Okay.

**Tyram:** is is the extent of my plan

**Justin Hale:** He wants them to not be

**Christopher Hooper:** Um just

**Tyram:** here. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** alive.

**Tyram:** Well, I guess I'll think at the others like we only need one

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** to answer questions and uh yeah, I'll teleport next to him and I'll try to stab him with my psychic

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, you

**Tyram:** dagger. Do do I get like a full turns worth of actions here?

**Christopher Hooper:** can. Um, I will I will just remind you there is like

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** a totally like these two groups that like are running basically ahead of you um that are not engaged right now. Um, so just

**Tyram:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** keep that in mind if you're going to stay and fight because that'll slow

**Tyram:** man.

**Christopher Hooper:** these ambushers down, but it'll slow you down a

**Tyram:** Okay. I guess I'll think of the group. Brew, you're the only one who really needs to be tailing them. You're the one with the the lookout, right? Okay.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. All right. All

**Tyram:** I'll try to slow these guys down. Okay. All right. So, I'm gonna try to stab this

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** lot.

**Tyram:** guy. Uh 23. All right. That was with not advantage. So, I'll just have to roll if and I rolled a one. Um but that is still uh six

**Christopher Hooper:** It's okay. Cool. Um, so you kind of catch him. Yeah. Go

**Tyram:** damage. Oh. Oh, wait. Never mind. I already used my bonus

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead. Oh, for teleporting. Yeah.

**Tyram:** action. Never mind. Yeah, never mind. I was going to try to stab

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh uh you

**Tyram:** him again, but I can't. But I have him vexed at

**Christopher Hooper:** you kind of catch him unawares behind you uh behind him. Um he turns and uh and stumbles as uh you cut at him uh and then uh turns around to attack

**Tyram:** least.

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Um but instead of attacking you uh he is going to Um, does a 19 hit?

**Tyram:** Um, is it like a normal attack roll? Okay, I'm going to use uh uh defensive duelist to uh block the attack, which boosts my

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. Okay, cool. It looks like he

**Tyram:** AC up to uh 22.

**Christopher Hooper:** like threw some sort one of those I don't know what it's called, but Batman always uses it, which has like two balls around the string and

**Tyram:** Oh, like a

**Christopher Hooper:** it Oh, is that what that's called? A

**Tyram:** like a bolo, I think.


### [01:00:00]

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, hello. Thank you.

**Christopher Hooper:** bowler that like wraps around something to like Yeah. So,

**Tyram:** So,

**Christopher Hooper:** he tossed that at you and it looks like he who was going to hit you, but

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** your defensive duelist uh allows you to dink it away. Um, and the others are

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** now continuing to run um across the buildings. Uh, anyone uh who else wants to act here?

**Luke Neverisky:** So there are, just to reiterate, there's a couple people that have tried to engage us and then there are

**Christopher Hooper:** That's great.

**Luke Neverisky:** the a few people on the streets below that are running away. Is that

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** right? Okay. Crimson is chasing the Okay. Um, so we'd like to catch up

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** with those people. Okay. Um, we can see

**Justin Hale:** They're

**Christopher Hooper:** You can

**Luke Neverisky:** them. The people that Crimson is trailing. Is that

**Christopher Hooper:** you can see crimson like hovering like right above them. Um and like

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** if you wanted to you could push yourself to try to like make eye contact like get eyesight of the groups. But right now, like as you're running on the on the

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** building tops, you're ma mostly trying to keep up with

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Um, it's probably too much. I'm guessing it's probably too much for me to know Crimson is right above them and like hypnotic pattern and draw the cube like on Crimson to have that. That seems too metaming. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** crimson. Talk me through it.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, so I'm thinking right if Crimson is in theory on top of like the two people we're chasing and if my target of hypnotic pattern is on crimson essentially that's a 15 foot radius if you

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** will and I'm wondering if them but I don't think I even know that crimson's on top of

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, you could give me an inside

**Luke Neverisky:** them. So I think that's probably too

**Christopher Hooper:** check. Um or yeah, some sort of int

**Luke Neverisky:** metagaming.

**Christopher Hooper:** based check here I think would be good if you wanted if you wanted to go through

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, that's a 20 on

**Christopher Hooper:** that. So you're kind of big braining right now. uh you figured out uh like like Brew told you like he assigned Crimson to like follow them and you you think that you can just quite figure out and predict where

**Luke Neverisky:** insight.

**Christopher Hooper:** these two groups are going. Now Brew told you I think Brew told you there are two groups um running. I don't think he's told you much more than that.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so, uh, you probably think that if you had to guess, you would think that the

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** trailing group is is probably like, you know, diagonal, right? Uh, you know, diagonal in front of Crimson. And you think you could probably place that hypnotic pattern just right to hit that that trailing group if you wanted to. Now, another insight is you don't know who the good guys

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, that's a good point. I also don't want to hit pattern crimson. I just thought about that. I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** are.

**Luke Neverisky:** assuming that he would also fall to that. So,

**Tyram:** Yeah. If Crimson is a failure, then

**Luke Neverisky:** okay. All

**Tyram:** he's susceptible to all the stuff that would affect

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe

**Tyram:** a any other character. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. In that case, um the one on the roof or one of the ones on the roof that's didn't stab um I will make them do a wisdom save of 16 or be held the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so all four. Is that what you're

**Luke Neverisky:** person. Uh oh, actually I could have guessed it,

**Christopher Hooper:** saying? Well, so there's one engaged with

**Luke Neverisky:** huh?

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus right now and then three that are coming on to you.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, okay. In that case, I will Yeah, you know what? I'll try to upcast it. Um, so I'll try to target all three. Need to make a

**Christopher Hooper:** So,

**Luke Neverisky:** wisdom save of

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Um, they all

**Luke Neverisky:** 16. Well, all right

**Christopher Hooper:** failed. Hold person. Is that what you said? Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Thank

**Luke Neverisky:** then.

**Christopher Hooper:** Give me the duration on that and uh any

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Uh, one minute. And they make their save

**Christopher Hooper:** constraints 6 seconds or whatever. Yeah. Um

**Luke Neverisky:** every Yeah.

**Tyram:** I don't think that's the case. I think that just it's I don't think they get back up. I don't think they get saves anymore. I think it just last out. Hypnotic

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Oh, you're right. I was Well, let me

**Christopher Hooper:** and old person,

**Tyram:** pattern is great. Oh, sorry.

**Luke Neverisky:** see. No, this is hold

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Tyram:** I thought you were doing hypnotic pattern. My mistake. Oh, yeah. They get safe for hypnotic. They get

**Luke Neverisky:** person. You're good then. Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** At the end of the turns,

**Tyram:** safe for a whole person.

**Christopher Hooper:** they repeat the save. Um, they have the paralyzed condition. Um, and you need to This is not a concentration spell. It is. Okay. Okay. For one minute. All right. Gotcha. Cool. So, you catch the um what what happens if they receive damage?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. Nothing. uh every they're paralyzed so all damage is critical and uh but that's it. They're still I don't believe they have to make a save when they're damaged either unlike um I can't think of it at the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. All right. Great. Um, so you catch three. one was just transitioning between

**Luke Neverisky:** moment. I was going to ask about

**Christopher Hooper:** buildings. And let me look at is fall

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** damage 1d6 every 10

**Luke Neverisky:** Plus for every 10 ft I

**Christopher Hooper:** ft. Um y'all are about 30 ft up. Uh let's see. You said um they're all damage is critical. Is that what you said?

**Luke Neverisky:** think I believe so as part of paralyzed if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure incoming attacks are critical.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, so that would be uh if we're doing crit damage rules, that's um 18 uh is the max for 3d6 plus an additional 11. Um so um you hear a very loud thump and nothing else because it realized Uh, I

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, do you think it's okay?

**Christopher Hooper:** don't think so. I don't think he's

**Tyram:** Who cares? They're iron

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Tyram:** claws.

**Luke Neverisky:** traumatized for

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, uh, Brew,

**Luke Neverisky:** a

**Christopher Hooper:** um, I need you to give me a dexterity saving throw to try to maintain, um, your your, um, your, uh, chase. the DC here uh because of the s*** going on around you, I'm going to say is

**Luke Neverisky:** citizen.

**Christopher Hooper:** probably actually they've done a really good job of of keeping the heat off you. I'm going to say it's probably a uh we'll say a 13

**Justin Hale:** Does meet it beat it? Cuz I got a

**Christopher Hooper:** here. Meets it beats it. Nice. Nice.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hey.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah, so like you're in the zone, you're like

**Justin Hale:** 13.

**Christopher Hooper:** moving poof poof um keeping up with Crimson. You're very focused and it looks like your team has basically like kept the heat off you. Um, is still free to act if you want to if you want to act

**Walden Briarhelm:** I think I'm mostly just if I were in character, I'd be making sure that people aren't getting hurt. I don't think I'd be able to do a whole lot ranged and let everybody else

**Christopher Hooper:** here, you're going to make sure people aren't getting

**Walden Briarhelm:** do their thing. Just being support role right now. I can't cast spells

**Christopher Hooper:** hurt. So, the big thing is there's basically two

**Walden Briarhelm:** or throw things. So I don't do much for

**Christopher Hooper:** groups, right? There's the ones that are at least Silus seems to be hanging back. Um, uh, Liliana paused at least momentarily as Brew is kind of like sprinting ahead. So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** range.

**Christopher Hooper:** you kind of have a choice to either try to like stay and try to take care of the Iron Claws or to keep going with Brew.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Going with team green skin. Going to run it

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, cool. Um, go ahead and give

**Walden Briarhelm:** with

**Tyram:** You move faster than any of

**Christopher Hooper:** me Yeah,

**Tyram:** the rest of us. So, yeah, you'd be a good person to be part of the chase

**Christopher Hooper:** that's true. Um, do you want to give me

**Walden Briarhelm:** brew.

**Christopher Hooper:** a athletics or acrobatics check or do you want

**Tyram:** party.

**Christopher Hooper:** to do you have any other idea of what you want to do?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Um, we're all able to go through the silus switch of mental talk. Uh, uh, Brew, what are you doing? What are you going to do if you catch

**Justin Hale:** I didn't think that

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. Oh, good

**Walden Briarhelm:** them? You You did

**Justin Hale:** was

**Walden Briarhelm:** not think. Okay, if I am able to catch them, what

**Justin Hale:** first. First thing

**Walden Briarhelm:** do you want me to

**Christopher Hooper:** question.

**Walden Briarhelm:** do? Okay, if I can catch them, I will do my best

**Justin Hale:** later.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to uh secure them for you. I'm going to try

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to take off. I'm going to try to just burst

**Justin Hale:** He's straight

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, you are very fast, ma. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** ahead

**Christopher Hooper:** and you can be even faster if you choose to.


### [01:10:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** typically.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I guess the big question I have for you

**Justin Hale:** ahead.

**Christopher Hooper:** is, uh, which group are you trying to to get on top

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm having a hard time with theater of the mind here, but it goes group A, ironclaws, and then

**Christopher Hooper:** of? Um, it

**Walden Briarhelm:** brew. as far as maybe I should say as far as distance away

**Christopher Hooper:** is

**Walden Briarhelm:** from because I know the groups aren't huddled together. It's they've

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. So um if we if we put um as the origin in our plane um we

**Walden Briarhelm:** diverged.

**Christopher Hooper:** have Brew uh Crimson group uh A chasing group B ahead of them and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** then behind Ma is uh Ironclaws and Helisana and then Silas.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, wow. Okay. Group A, group B, and group ironclaw. Oh, man. And everybody's kind of in a train running. I'm just going to try to get to the front, I guess. Like, I'm going to try to stop the train completely. I'm going to suplex the

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh yeah, go

**Walden Briarhelm:** train. Uh,

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it I would want to start by just accelerating and possibly just jumping building to building to try to get ahead instead

**Christopher Hooper:** Do you want

**Walden Briarhelm:** of sticking to this running thing we're

**Christopher Hooper:** to do you want to push yourself

**Walden Briarhelm:** doing. Yeah, we're going

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Okay. Uh why don't you give

**Walden Briarhelm:** for it. Kaio

**Christopher Hooper:** me an athletics check? The DC is uh we're going to say a 20 gets you to the first group. If you beat a 20, um, you do it for free and you can get in front. If you get below a 20, um, you can get to

**Walden Briarhelm:** can.

**Christopher Hooper:** the front, but it's going to cost you 10 HP. Um, if you get 10 below a 20, um, you can try to get to the front, but it'll cost you an exhaustion level. If you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** get below that, you get

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I rolled a 12, so I'm above

**Christopher Hooper:** nothing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the exhaustion, but I take 10 HP. How do I take this damage? Just from pushing myself.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um, so as you're running, um, so you make it to the front, but you get beaten up along the way. You want to describe how you do

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh yeah. So, as

**Christopher Hooper:** that?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm I'm I'm chasing down Brew basically and uh I pull like on your left and take a long bound and jump between one building to the next, landing uh closer to group A. And uh as I'm passing them, is there maybe this is an opportunity? Uh do I notice anything about them or am I more I would I think I'd probably be more dead set

**Christopher Hooper:** I think with

**Walden Briarhelm:** on getting up front and less about trying to perceive anything that

**Christopher Hooper:** that 12. No, you you're pushing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** stands out.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Uh I would say as I'm trying to pass this group, we've got some people that are like watching me and maybe even somebody's tried to like shove at me. Maybe I stumbled a little bit and as I go for the next jump to try to catch up to the front group, I land a little

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** poorly. Something along those lines. 10 HP shouldn't be too

**Christopher Hooper:** I was thinking like as you like jump off the building like you try to stifle your fall but even still you you hit the ground pretty hard and uh hit into another wall. Um, you are you you eventually

**Walden Briarhelm:** bad.

**Christopher Hooper:** through this cascade you you stop and you see in front of you three ironclaws that are running that are just kind of like stop themselves right in front of you. Uh, and that is the first group. Um, and then behind them you see these knights in full full armor and they have these incredible

**Walden Briarhelm:** Dragon

**Christopher Hooper:** like knights helmets on with that are in the shape of like a dragon skull. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** armor. So

**Christopher Hooper:** and they have uh these like uh the one

**Walden Briarhelm:** awesome.

**Christopher Hooper:** in the center there's uh three of them and the one in the center has um these scabbards that uh are adorned with um dragon bone wings that are coming off the the back. Um and um he uh he pulls out a huge great sword um and approaches the dragon claws and and you on the other side um and uh he

**Walden Briarhelm:** Awesome.

**Christopher Hooper:** says stop in the name of the order of St. George. Um, at this point, the Ironclaws uh turn around and they they lunge at him and he swiftly beheads him. Uh, the one that lunges. Um, and I mean, you have the drop on them at this point. Uh, do you want to do anything in this

**Walden Briarhelm:** Jeez. You're telling me dragon boys just head

**Christopher Hooper:** moment? Uh, yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** chopped the iron claws that were at the front?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Damn. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** I need a moment to think. What would Wilma do?

**Christopher Hooper:** why don't we take a beat there as you're thinking and we can hop to the to other

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** perspectives. Um so why don't we resolve Silus here. Um you're mono ammono. He's like um you're you're one-on-one with this

**Walden Briarhelm:** yeah.

**Tyram:** Okay. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** guy.

**Tyram:** I managed to hit him with my attack last time, which means he's vexed. So, I should be able to attack him with advantage now. Okay, so I'm going to jump at him and just like try to like bring down my knife on

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay,

**Tyram:** him. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** that

**Tyram:** 24. And now I get my sweet, sweet

**Christopher Hooper:** hits

**Tyram:** sneak

**Justin Hale:** Oh yeah, girl.

**Walden Briarhelm:** What? I'm sorry. What did you call the

**Tyram:** attack.

**Walden Briarhelm:** shoulder armor? Did you call them

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so uh he has like his greatsword like scabbard mounted on his back. Yeah. And on the

**Walden Briarhelm:** scabbards? Oh, okay. Okay, there we

**Christopher Hooper:** back is adorned with the dragon bone

**Walden Briarhelm:** go. Got it. Sorry. I wanted to

**Christopher Hooper:** wings.

**Walden Briarhelm:** really enjoy that mental image. So, are they Is there any color to the armor?

**Luke Neverisky:** Hello.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's all like bone

**Walden Briarhelm:** Are they all different? Are they the same? Oh, this is cool. Sorry.

**Tyram:** Pulrons. Okay. Um I get him for uh 28 damage with that first

**Christopher Hooper:** white. All right. How do you want to kill

**Tyram:** attack. Okay. So, um I guess I'm just picturing like um I man like I'm going to say like maybe he

**Christopher Hooper:** him?

**Tyram:** zero on

**Luke Neverisky:** D8

**Justin Hale:** 15.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. 15. Um you uh you're running and uh you're trying to keep pace and you actually miss a step that would have taken you cascading between the buildings and a little like song note uh gives you a little platform

**Tyram:** them.

**Justin Hale:** Holy

**Christopher Hooper:** to step on as you continue to the next building. Um,

**Tyram:** Yeah, this f******

**Christopher Hooper:** and

**Tyram:** Mario mechanic ass s*** you're pulling

**Christopher Hooper:** you uh you reach to the to the building where you

**Justin Hale:** s***.

**Christopher Hooper:** now see uh the ironclaw lunge at this knight uh that you saw their their bone emblems uh in view on on the back of their uniforms. And you

**Tyram:** out.

**Christopher Hooper:** see him draw a sword and and um behead him at that point. Um, and you hear you can hear them. Uh, you're you're close enough uh on the on the rooftops to be able to hear them. Um, they are basically at this alley that is just about to hit this main thoroughfare, but they're just tucked right inside at this point. And you seem like right behind the ironclaws like ready to fight but like just saw these like uh f****** sick cool dragon knights behead an ironclaw person. Yeah. Go

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, so Ma

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead.

**Walden Briarhelm:** has been standing there and he realizes the moment's intense and he only has one fall back when the energyy's that strong. He leans over and you see him maybe kind of rumaging and out comes a black mask and he ties on and says, "Are you ready, brother?" It's doing like a flex just to show um I don't know what I would roll, but if I was trying to be Oh, I do know what I'd roll. Intimidating. Can I give that a

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah, go ahead.

**Walden Briarhelm:** shot? I I don't know that I can intimidate people who wear badass dragon bone armor, but I want to try. All right, here we go. Got a

**Christopher Hooper:** 15.

**Walden Briarhelm:** 15.

**Luke Neverisky:** intimidation.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I think uh you're like large presence and uh you have like a large

**Justin Hale:** Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** like shadow that kind of emanates from you as you put on

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** the mask. Um, and

**Tyram:** Roll the

**Christopher Hooper:** you um you can just make out a little smirk from this knight approaching these two ironclaws and the ironclaws like look back to you um

**Tyram:** truck.

**Christopher Hooper:** like in surprise. This is they didn't even realize you're behind them. Um and they and they uh one as they turn like swipes at you. Um Um, does a 16 hit? Um, he swipes at you and you're

**Walden Briarhelm:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** just able to to step aside uh as he swings. Um, cool. Uh,

**Justin Hale:** I swung

**Christopher Hooper:** anyone have something they want to do here?

**Tyram:** I want to kill one of the other paralyzed Iron Claws real quick if

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Okay. Do you want to do the one that uh Liliana's

**Tyram:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** like um napping against or the other

**Tyram:** can. I'm trying to think which would be funnier. Probably the one that it Liliana is like pressing

**Luke Neverisky:** Nothing

**Christopher Hooper:** one? Um I think yeah I I

**Tyram:** against,

**Luke Neverisky:** against

**Christopher Hooper:** think you're already stabbing the other one. Um but up to

**Tyram:** right? I'm going to arrogantly assume that I can one hit kill them if I get an automatic crit in my sneak

**Christopher Hooper:** you probably

**Tyram:** attack because I'm going to start at uh 36. Sorry. I'm going to start at 41 damage and then roll five d sorry

**Christopher Hooper:** It's a good

**Tyram:** 6d6 on top of that.

**Christopher Hooper:** chance. I mean, yes, you will one hit kill either of

**Tyram:** Okay. Okay. So, I'm looking at Liliana like pushing against this

**Christopher Hooper:** them.

**Tyram:** guy. I'm just going to like hop up on that guy's shoulders. I'm going to be looking at Liliana materialize my dagger above his head and just be like straight down into his head. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** No, you don't need to. Unless you want

**Tyram:** Do you want me to roll or not? Okay, you know

**Christopher Hooper:** to. Yeah.

**Tyram:** what? Let's see how high this goes. I rarely get to do this much damage.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yo.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Um, oh, and I rolled pretty solid, too. Um, okay. So, that's a 14.

**Christopher Hooper:** damn

**Tyram:** Okay. Came back down to earth a little bit there at the end there. Um, yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Who needs

**Tyram:** Uh um so that's a total of 63

**Luke Neverisky:** some?

**Christopher Hooper:** averages 63. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Is that a

**Tyram:** damage.

**Christopher Hooper:** Is that a campaign high? I don't know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** God damn.

**Tyram:** Yeah, it might

**Luke Neverisky:** I think

**Christopher Hooper:** pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** That attack could be Ma in an arm wrestling match. That's

**Justin Hale:** Perfect.

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Walden Briarhelm:** crazy.

**Luke Neverisky:** so. That would want to hit

**Walden Briarhelm:** Holy. Yeah, I'm at 64 health currently. If I was

**Tyram:** be

**Walden Briarhelm:** in the wake of this, who knows?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um Um All right. And then Liliana, do you wanna

**Tyram:** Got

**Christopher Hooper:** Um Hey, Christie. What do you

**Luke Neverisky:** full.

**Christopher Hooper:** do?

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm gonna let out like a little a little like

**Tyram:** it. Technically, there's

**Luke Neverisky:** shriek and be like, "Ew, it's gross. It's blood everywhere."

**Tyram:** no blood. It was psychic

**Luke Neverisky:** Silus. Well, never mind. There's no

**Christopher Hooper:** Which is even

**Tyram:** damage.

**Luke Neverisky:** blood. Actually, you know what? I'm gonna like

**Christopher Hooper:** weirder.

**Tyram:** You just you just see the like you just see the light like just

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm gonna be so

**Justin Hale:** So

**Tyram:** drain out of this guy's eyes

**Luke Neverisky:** distraught. I still

**Justin Hale:** much psychological

**Luke Neverisky:** think I'm still getting used to uh Silus's maybe psychic things. I'm

**Justin Hale:** life.

**Luke Neverisky:** gonna assume there's going to be blood and be like, "What the

**Tyram:** basically. You're good. You're

**Luke Neverisky:** f***?"

**Tyram:** good.

**Luke Neverisky:** But I I almost had

**Tyram:** There's the other one over there. If you want to try

**Luke Neverisky:** him. I mean it. Yeah, I got this

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. What are you going to

**Luke Neverisky:** one. I'm get a I'm get a running start and try to

**Christopher Hooper:** do? Yeah. Good. Good. Give me an athletic

**Luke Neverisky:** shove it. Please fail. Please fail. Please fail. s***. I got a

**Christopher Hooper:** pick. Oh, pretty good. Uh, yeah, you do a good job, I think. Uh yeah, like

**Tyram:** again.

**Christopher Hooper:** describe describe what you do

**Luke Neverisky:** 17. So, I'm gonna like roll up my sleeves and then just kind of like run across the rooftop to to them. Um, and then just try to uh do like the most basic like run and then just shove and hopefully uh hopefully it goes

**Christopher Hooper:** here. Uh yeah, he like uh you you carry enough momentum and you you have this like you know

**Luke Neverisky:** somewhere.


### [01:30:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** wiry woman like strength that you're able to yeet him off and off the side of the building and you hear another silent uh as he hits the the ground.

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh

**Luke Neverisky:** definitely don't look. I'm just

**Christopher Hooper:** um cool. Uh, so y'all have vanquished the ambushers. Um, we hop over to Ma and

**Luke Neverisky:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** Brew and you see the uh the commander look now that he's closer. It looks to be um a dwarf figure. Call for a dwarf. um very like huge huge uh builtup um knight looking person. And at this point uh the the two Ironclaws kind of look around and say, "Oh, we I'm getting out of here, Cletus." And uh they try to run past you. Uh yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh are they on uh both

**Christopher Hooper:** Only one's trying to run

**Walden Briarhelm:** on one side or are they split half and

**Christopher Hooper:** right now.

**Walden Briarhelm:** half? Okay. Uh Ma is in full Ninja Turtle mode now. He's going to do like a where do you think you're going, brother? And like try to throw out the arm and hit the uh what do you call that? The clothes

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Uh, go ahead and give me um some kind of roll. Either probably like an attack roll. The maybe a straight attack roll.

**Walden Briarhelm:** line. Holy s***. I haven't done that in so long. I almost had to think

**Christopher Hooper:** You could do an unarmed strike roll,

**Walden Briarhelm:** like where where is that even at? Where do you do

**Christopher Hooper:** I think, here if you wanted.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that? Claws and unarmed are the same for me. But let's see what

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Walden Briarhelm:** we come on big month. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, 14. Uh, just beat him.

**Walden Briarhelm:** okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, he had a 13. So, you close on him. He falls down. Um and the other one of the other uh knights um has a bow

**Walden Briarhelm:** 14

**Christopher Hooper:** at the revity and shoots the other one in the head. The other one falls down. Um and there's this uh one ironclaw and the um the kind of head knight approaches you and says, "Thank you for your service, citizen." And uh he says, "I'll be taking this one for questioning." and he one hand picks up uh the ironclaw by his ankle and throws him over his shoulder and uh begins to walk off if you uh if you let him. Um Brew, uh you can jump too if you um have a chance. Um because you're you're pretty close

**Justin Hale:** Nope. This guy sounds bad.

**Christopher Hooper:** there.

**Justin Hale:** Scary.

**Christopher Hooper:** hear and she's no longer with you but you make great

**Walden Briarhelm:** gets.

**Justin Hale:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** time uh and you you get to the final building

And I can do compelled duel, basically taunt I'm wondering if the two that aren't carrying the iron claw are like leading the way because he stepped forward. I'm wondering if I can compelling duel the guy carrying the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so pretty much like the

**Walden Briarhelm:** ironclaw.

**Tyram:** Just talk to them. Why are you making this a

**Christopher Hooper:** two.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I'm I'm kind of just curious,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so to lay to lay the scene and like he

**Walden Briarhelm:** too.

**Christopher Hooper:** him.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. So, he would have led the way out. Okay. Just

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um so they are starting to stroll down

**Tyram:** Good. Find somewhere.

**Walden Briarhelm:** up and brushes off the the the debris and is like, "Oh, I'll join you at the

**Luke Neverisky:** Rice

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's You are so disciplined. It's

**Justin Hale:** Delicious.

**Walden Briarhelm:** insane. If you could potentially package just like a few units of discipline and ship them over

**Luke Neverisky:** cake.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to me, I'll pay for like a dry ice overnight if it's one of those kind of things. Cuz to

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Walden Briarhelm:** think about sitting down and is it plain or is it like cinnamon or is there anything fun? That's

**Luke Neverisky:** right. It's a lightly salted

**Walden Briarhelm:** that's I did the stuffed peppers from Costco tonight and typically they're not good.

**Luke Neverisky:** plane. Heck

**Walden Briarhelm:** I've had them twice before. I was like I will never get these again.

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** And I was at the store and there was one more, just one sitting packaged that day, which was yesterday. And I was like, something's telling me I'm supposed to do it. So, I took It is the first time I've had one that had seasoning in it. It feels like they never add salt or pepper to it, and it just tastes bland. This one was like marinara. The rice was tender inside of it, and peppers were good. like they tasted like bell pepper and not like uh cellulose that's colored. You know what I mean? When it's nothing, it's just plant

**Luke Neverisky:** Got it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** matter. H I ate two of them and I feel like I could explode, but it was really

**Luke Neverisky:** It was weird, but I was I was listening as I was getting this and you ever do like my brain just totally went offline and I brought my my rice cakes to like the the island in my kitchen. I started like grinding pepper on them. It's like what the f*** am I

**Walden Briarhelm:** good. Want a little bite with your rice

**Luke Neverisky:** doing? And so

**Walden Briarhelm:** cake?

**Luke Neverisky:** Kayla's over. She's like, "What are you doing?" I'm like, "I don't know. I just got totally distracted by D and D. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** The edible just hit and I was like, I need to

**Luke Neverisky:** just went on autopilot

**Walden Briarhelm:** spice up. I need to hit it with my spice weasel.

**Luke Neverisky:** here." Damn. Yeah, that was those moments you feel like you're going crazy. You're like, I I swear I'm not

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***. Sometimes, especially on Fridays, the brain just dumbs. And you did gym earlier, so you let your brain turn to like auto

**Luke Neverisky:** high.

**Walden Briarhelm:** instead of think mode. I mean, when I'm at the gym, I don't typically let my brain do a lot. I just go with the whatever 15 years of doing it that just autopilots me through it. I totally opposing note. I have started to figure out how to combat my lower back pain from sitting and working all day. Back

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** extensions with the Yep. But

**Luke Neverisky:** I was Just ask

**Walden Briarhelm:** not just doing them because like I can go grab 70 pound dumbbells and and pop off 10 and be like, "Yeah, I'm so strong." But then I'll feel like I'm going to vomit. I have to sit like on the ground and breathe for a while. Uh I'm doing no weight, but I'm doing like a I don't know how what else to call it, but a progression. So it starts with hands crossed until you get to the bottom. Then you

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** release and you like let your arms tuck towards your feet. So you are fully inverted at this point. And then you try to touch your toes. Like the goal is to get all the way to the toe and then release and allow for a moment to stretch. Then reflex after you've decompressed up. And the idea is that it's to go slow. I can do like 11 of those and I feel like I might die. But afterwards, I'm like, "Holy s***, the stretch in the lower back and going slow with no weight." How it becomes difficult is more about utilizing more of the many layers of back muscle than it is about like getting big, bro. And I've been throwing it in on every day except

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** for uh more of an upper body day, so push day. And I gotta say, I am I am liking it quite a bit. I do feel like it makes a difference. Uh, and I've been watching videos about the whole SI joint anyways because sitting all the time just feels like poo poo. So, I'm trying to get it

**Luke Neverisky:** fine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** fixed. And back extensions seem to be the winner. You remember me talking about Logan? He moved to Chicago. He's 6'4 and he sits all day. I feel like his back has got to feel like just toasted by

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** like 2 PM. I can't even imagine what his back feels like. But he has also been following the same kind of plan that I've been doing with the back extension and he's like it's starting to just feel

**Luke Neverisky:** over.

**Walden Briarhelm:** okay. Like no amount of stretching has ever really

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Walden Briarhelm:** fixed it, but abdominal strengthening and lower back extensions have made a huge difference.

**Luke Neverisky:** good. Yeah. Feel a little lower back. Get a little glute activation with that. Um, yeah. I mean, that's that's why I do a lot of my calls off camera for work and I'm just prone on the floor in back extensions just because one, it feels good to not be sitting and then two, you actually get some passive stretch there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yep. I'll do it just because we're on camera. I sit like this if I'm on the bed with my feet up all like like I'm on like a phone call and then stuff. This is how I take most calls. But clients don't tend to like

**Luke Neverisky:** No, do it on stand up. You won't

**Walden Briarhelm:** that. Oh, challenge. This is

**Luke Neverisky:** do

**Walden Briarhelm:** easy. I'll do it with a client. I'll call that guy chicken f*****.

**Luke Neverisky:** it. License and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sorry. Justin's walking through a house with children and I just said the

**Luke Neverisky:** registration. Trader.

**Justin Hale:** Oh, with any luck, they're asleep.

**Walden Briarhelm:** phrase I said.

**Justin Hale:** 10 o'clock. I hope they're

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, I will put that good luck out there. Pretty sure Liliana can cast sleep, so like put it on

**Justin Hale:** asleep. They got to be a swim class at 8:30 in the morning. So, they better be

**Luke Neverisky:** Thank

**Justin Hale:** asleep.

**Walden Briarhelm:** her. They have what? Class. What? Oh, swim class. I was like, they have class. It's Friday. That ain't

**Justin Hale:** Swim.

**Walden Briarhelm:** cool. How are they

**Luke Neverisky:** you. They do it over there in Ohio.

**Justin Hale:** Yep. Good. Ollie just got moved into the next

**Walden Briarhelm:** doing at

**Justin Hale:** class up. We're both level nine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** swimming? What is that?

**Justin Hale:** Uh it uh we're not sure yet because this will be his first time, but like he was learning like actual things to do right before they moved him up. So like torpedo and like different spins underwater

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Justin Hale:** and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh s***. You're teaching him how to swim. He's going to have free

**Luke Neverisky:** know

**Walden Briarhelm:** form like movement. I'm thinking like how to stay buoyant and maybe how to do your your typical overhand, not

**Luke Neverisky:** that. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** breast stroke and f****** leaky

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's what it started at. But he's

**Walden Briarhelm:** s***. That's awesome

**Justin Hale:** um quick learner on the on the

**Walden Briarhelm:** though.

**Justin Hale:** swim.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, maybe he's the next

**Justin Hale:** The uh the wise swim classes are are pretty

**Walden Briarhelm:** Phelps. That's right. That's what I

**Justin Hale:** dope. Yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** did when I was a kid, I think, to learn.

**Tyram:** All

**Justin Hale:** I got a freaking Olympic sized pool and

**Tyram:** right.

**Justin Hale:** multiple year swim teams and whole bunch of stuff. It's kind of crazy.


### [01:50:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** Anyways, cool. That's exciting.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I hope he enjoys it and sticks with it. Has he done Has

**Justin Hale:** No, no, they still have them in the

**Walden Briarhelm:** he done any diving boards

**Justin Hale:** uh in the kitty

**Walden Briarhelm:** yet? Okay. So, he's probably like one more class away then from like getting to do the first

**Justin Hale:** pool.

**Walden Briarhelm:** diving board, whatever that is, just to jump off and become and

**Justin Hale:** Oh. Uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** swim. How old is he? Right. He's

**Justin Hale:** seven

**Walden Briarhelm:** smart. That's why you say things that he does and I'm like kids were like 10 when I think of that stuff. All right. Sorry. Seven. No, he's like

**Justin Hale:** first grade.

**Walden Briarhelm:** first or second grade then.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Speaking of smart, he um

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's

**Justin Hale:** their reading comprehension is supposed to be uh I can't remember what it what it was. It's like at the end of the year he's supposed to be at like I don't remember what the numbers are, but it's like 60 something for words. Uh, I don't know if it's words per minute or like what the thing

**Walden Briarhelm:** super

**Justin Hale:** is. Yeah. So, it's the the number is supposed to be at 60 and his

**Walden Briarhelm:** comprehension.

**Justin Hale:** number when he started school this year was 180. So, yeah, we were like, "All right, that's one we don't have to worry about."

**Walden Briarhelm:** He's gonna love school, I

**Justin Hale:** Oh, he absolutely loves

**Walden Briarhelm:** think. I was going to say he sounds like he absorbs. He doesn't

**Justin Hale:** school. his so

**Walden Briarhelm:** learn, he

**Justin Hale:** uh Donkey Kong Bonanza the Switch 2

**Walden Briarhelm:** absorbs. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** game playing with me because it has like this like co-op light

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** mode and he reads all of the uh dialogue and there was one part I can't remember what it said but it was like uh what was it thermonuclear precipitation or something and he straight up site read it and I was like what the hell

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's amazing. You're really giving me hope because the little bit of social exposure I have to reading comprehension in this country has me scared. So, I'm glad that you've got a kid who's reading for like

**Justin Hale:** You're um he gets mad when I tell him to go read a read a

**Walden Briarhelm:** five

**Justin Hale:** chapter of a book and then like he'll straight up throw a fit and then he comes back and he's like, "Okay, I read three. You happy?" And I'm like, "I just wanted you to read one chapter, dude."

**Walden Briarhelm:** Man, I'm pissed. You got to go read another

**Justin Hale:** Right. Bet you won't read

**Walden Briarhelm:** one. You know what? I'm going to have you read a math textbook and then I'm going to test you on chapter one and two. The first chapters on

**Justin Hale:** four. You know what pimas is,

**Walden Briarhelm:** proofs. You going to learn

**Luke Neverisky:** s***.

**Justin Hale:** boy?

**Luke Neverisky:** Please excuse my dear own Sally. That's

**Tyram:** I actually never heard the PIMDS uh framing for until I started

**Walden Briarhelm:** today. I didn't do

**Tyram:** tutoring. Yeah, I heard Please excuse my dear aunt Sally. That's the one that

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** Wheelie used. But PMDOS just makes so much sense. I'm just surprised that none of

**Justin Hale:** Really? That's what we used pretty much

**Tyram:** my math teachers ever use that one.

**Justin Hale:** exclusively in uh in high school

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Justin Hale:** back in the day.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I never heard that. I I also didn't hear that. Even in Scholastic Bull, that wasn't something we were taught, but probably because you should know that by then, like more inherently. I like the one the the rule I never learned in school was the X% of Y is Y% of X. Like, oh, what a rule to know. Like if somebody asks you what 17% of 50 is, you're like the f*** if I know. But if I asked you what's 50% of 17, you're like, well, that's doable. Yeah, that is I wish you you teach that

**Tyram:** Yeah, that is a good one to

**Walden Briarhelm:** to kids and they be like, "Oh, math's kind of cool." Like, "Yeah, yeah, there's little

**Tyram:** know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** tricks like that all over." And if you get really good at it, you can do it with huge numbers. What do you guys got for the weekend? Anybody got a a big exciting? Oh, never mind. He has returned. Unless you have something cool or exciting this weekend.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, we also have swim class tomorrow where Ash's doing a great job. Yeah, very it's

**Tyram:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** been great. Which uh I like that swim class is just like I never had swim lessons as a

**Justin Hale:** Nice. Same.

**Christopher Hooper:** kid and I hate it. Like I I wish I were better at

**Walden Briarhelm:** To

**Christopher Hooper:** swimming. Um, and I'm like, "You're going to be good at swimming."

**Tyram:** yeah. Yeah. I remember all those times you've almost

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I I have a couple times

**Tyram:** drowned.

**Christopher Hooper:** actually. Um, so yeah, I'm like, "Not you, kiddo. No child of mine." Uh, and she loves it. So, this is

**Tyram:** Yeah, we go up to like, hey, let's just swim across this pond real quick. was like, "No, guys. I got to walk

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I'm offended you would

**Christopher Hooper:** awesome. But

**Walden Briarhelm:** Ashton's at the front of the pack

**Christopher Hooper:** Caleb, I can't. Have any of youall seen Mighty

**Walden Briarhelm:** leading

**Christopher Hooper:** N? All right. It's It's really good, but uh The Goblin is afraid of

**Tyram:** Who does their taxes in a public cafe like this? That actually seems like a really bad

**Justin Hale:** It's like typical grayport behavior.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh

**Justin Hale:** Actually, it's kind of weird. Don't do your taxes in public.

**Christopher Hooper:** um

**Tyram:** idea.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I don't know. I guess so. No reason not

**Walden Briarhelm:** Roll

**Christopher Hooper:** to.

**Walden Briarhelm:** for initiative.

**Luke Neverisky:** for

**Justin Hale:** ape? Pulling thorns out.

**Tyram:** um I mean physically

**Justin Hale:** Licking

**Tyram:** you seem okay, but it looks like your heart's been

**Luke Neverisky:** grooming. Did

**Tyram:** broken.

**Luke Neverisky:** you know there's other people with my name here? I know. It's okay though. She has brown hair. That's

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm imagining as we're walking there's a bouquet that says

**Luke Neverisky:** fine. Are

**Walden Briarhelm:** Liliana's like flowers

**Tyram:** Impossible. Oh, what was that? The

**Walden Briarhelm:** like

**Tyram:** Simpsons like we're out of Liliana license

**Luke Neverisky:** we

**Justin Hale:** Oops.

**Christopher Hooper:** It is what it is. Um, all

**Tyram:** plates.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. You make your way through the the thoroughare along the canal and you um eventually get to uh you see first as it comes

**Luke Neverisky:** bored?

**Christopher Hooper:** up there is a storefront uh not a storefront a huge inn and mounted on the top is a dragon skeleton and right above the entrance is the is a huge adult dragon's skull. Um that uh is right above the door. Um and below it, the sign uh is called the dragon's hide. Uh and uh yeah, the uh the knights take you uh to this building.

**Tyram:** This isn't supposed to be a secret headquarters, is

**Christopher Hooper:** Um no one comes looking for us. Why are

**Tyram:** it? Fair

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** you say not secret? Huh?

**Tyram:** enough. It just it it this feels like you guys are like really leaning into the dragon

**Luke Neverisky:** sticky.

**Justin Hale:** It's a

**Tyram:** theme with the building here. Like if I was looking for dudes

**Justin Hale:** little It's

**Tyram:** wearing like dragon wings, this is the first place I'd

**Justin Hale:** kind of the only building with an entire dragon on top of it. Yeah. I

**Christopher Hooper:** You think so? Oh, no. There's the

**Justin Hale:** mean, but do you

**Christopher Hooper:** museum. It's got a dragon in

**Justin Hale:** see how those are different,

**Christopher Hooper:** it. What am

**Tyram:** look

**Justin Hale:** right? I mean, you

**Christopher Hooper:** I supposed to do with the dragon? Huh?

**Justin Hale:** could not display it on the top of the building right in front

**Christopher Hooper:** It doesn't fit inside. It would take so much space

**Justin Hale:** of

**Christopher Hooper:** inside to store it. What? This is valuable stuff. You

**Justin Hale:** No,

**Christopher Hooper:** want me to just get rid of

**Tyram:** No one said

**Justin Hale:** it's it is not inconspicuous if that is what you're going

**Christopher Hooper:** it? You think they look at that and they think

**Justin Hale:** for. What

**Christopher Hooper:** us? You think they they connect the two?

**Justin Hale:** I mean, giant dragon on the roof,

**Tyram:** that. Yes.

**Justin Hale:** dragon armor. It's not starts.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, but we but we like don't like dragons. So, they would be like, "It's definitely not that place with the dragon,

**Tyram:** But see, like you're wearing a bunch of dragon

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I don't I don't think the

**Tyram:** themed accutraments right

**Justin Hale:** perception is the part that is the disconnect there.

**Christopher Hooper:** right? It's pretty cool though, right? All

**Tyram:** now. Oh, no one said it wasn't

**Justin Hale:** It's cool as hell. But like

**Tyram:** cool.

**Luke Neverisky:** Pretty

**Justin Hale:** literally just tell people like, "Yeah, it's the building with the dragon on it." They be like, "Oh yeah, that one. I see it all the time. It's very

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Yeah, that's how we tell people to meet us. We

**Tyram:** Fair

**Christopher Hooper:** say it's a secret

**Justin Hale:** obvious. But see, it's not a

**Christopher Hooper:** inn. It has a giant dragon skeleton on top of

**Luke Neverisky:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Tyram:** enough. Yeah, you're you're really stretching the use of the

**Christopher Hooper:** Did you know this was

**Tyram:** word secret there.

**Justin Hale:** secret. I mean, we just got here,

**Tyram:** Yeah, we've been in

**Justin Hale:** so

**Tyram:** town. I mean, it's been a it's been a few years since we came through town, so no,

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Well, don't tell

**Tyram:** we're uh we're still kind of getting the lay of the land

**Justin Hale:** I It's not

**Christopher Hooper:** anybody about this place. It's

**Tyram:** again. I don't think I need

**Justin Hale:** possible to not know

**Tyram:** to. I I I suspect that your enemies are already well

**Christopher Hooper:** secret. And if you see them around

**Tyram:** aware of

**Christopher Hooper:** there, they're the next all all another

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** in called snitches

**Tyram:** it. Silus actually gets like a serious look on his face. Ironclaws

**Christopher Hooper:** hide.

**Tyram:** die on

**Justin Hale:** Hey, wait. Another serious question. If you

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I can agree

**Justin Hale:** open another in, what skeleton are you going to build on top of that

**Christopher Hooper:** there. Whoever Reddit our us

**Tyram:** sight. I look over

**Justin Hale:** one? So, it's going to be called the turtle hide.

**Christopher Hooper:** out or turtle

**Tyram:** at

**Christopher Hooper:** shell. I like that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I I I I I am picking up on

**Justin Hale:** No, different turtle. It's a

**Walden Briarhelm:** what you are all trying to say. I will be

**Justin Hale:** different turtle.

**Walden Briarhelm:** quiet. Yes. Yes. There's many

**Justin Hale:** Yep. At least to the I know. Is there your right? Something wrong with

**Christopher Hooper:** How How many turtles are

**Walden Briarhelm:** Who? Who

**Christopher Hooper:** there? Are there

**Walden Briarhelm:** is this?

**Justin Hale:** your There's so many tles you don't even know.

**Christopher Hooper:** a lot of turtles in the

**Justin Hale:** That's crazy how

**Christopher Hooper:** world? Okay. So, it's like enough where it would be inappropriate to if I saw one, you probably don't know him,

**Walden Briarhelm:** You you would be mistaken if you made that

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** assumption. Yes, I do not know every toal because I am a

**Justin Hale:** many. Do you know

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay. I won't I won't ask you

**Justin Hale:** any Do you know every

**Christopher Hooper:** then.

**Justin Hale:** door?

**Christopher Hooper:** No, but there's a lot of dwarfs. There's a whole

**Walden Briarhelm:** tortoise.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, there's a whole city of turtles,

**Christopher Hooper:** city where

**Walden Briarhelm:** There

**Tyram:** although this is like a a human city, so like I feel like dwarves are still the minority

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, yeah. I mean, sure. Yeah, I know

**Tyram:** here, you

**Christopher Hooper:** most of the dwarves in this

**Walden Briarhelm:** was

**Tyram:** know?

**Luke Neverisky:** Not

**Justin Hale:** too.

**Christopher Hooper:** city.

**Tyram:** Actually, we probably need to check on our friend who we pretty sure was brought

**Christopher Hooper:** Noted. Oh, all

**Tyram:** here. Uh maybe let's let's move this

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Let me let you in to the secret h.

**Walden Briarhelm:** not

**Tyram:** along.

**Christopher Hooper:** He opens

**Tyram:** Oh, and we've been having this whole conversation outside. Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** dead.

**Walden Briarhelm:** We're in

**Justin Hale:** Wait, hold

**Justin Hale:** you Did he just open the door? Like the no no secret like way to get it was just open the

**Christopher Hooper:** it. No. No. Of

**Justin Hale:** door. Okay. All

**Christopher Hooper:** course. You open the door. It's an in. What are you talking

**Walden Briarhelm:** the

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** about? A tavern.

**Luke Neverisky:** I like This

**Justin Hale:** Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** Inside there's lively music and people dancing and singing. Oh, we kill dragons and we love to fight and we

**Walden Briarhelm:** Are they all in the

**Christopher Hooper:** drink all day and we f*** all

**Tyram:** No one would ever suspect this place is your headquarters.

**Justin Hale:** emotionally more than

**Walden Briarhelm:** sleep. I think I

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Good job,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Nailed it.

**Tyram:** Mission accomplished. Although

**Christopher Hooper:** specifically?

**Tyram:** like if one member of the party is least likely to get hurt in almost any situation, it is probably the

**Justin Hale:** Follow.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, that Yeah, that one did have a lot of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Damn.

**Tyram:** rogue.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mr.

**Christopher Hooper:** like deck saves and like requiring like acrobatics or athletics.

**Tyram:** Oh, it was basically all the stuff that I'm very good

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. a very is like a highlight reel and then you got to

**Tyram:** at.

**Christopher Hooper:** reveal your like uh core character backstory. It's great. I am I am really cur

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** uh curious um like how you like how you want to interact with the um order of St. George. Um whether you just want to hand off the orb or whether you want to like insist on ensuring the ritual happens or something like

**Tyram:** Um, I feel like Silas, like his character arc now is that he wants to he's like starting to take more responsibility for these things. So like he probably would want to see it

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Tyram:** through at least like not necessarily like take point on anything, but like definitely like not just hand off the orb

**Walden Briarhelm:** What is the

**Tyram:** and f*** off.

**Walden Briarhelm:** reputation of the order of St. George? Do we know that

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I think

**Walden Briarhelm:** yet? Maybe is the

**Christopher Hooper:** only Silus would probably know that. Maybe

**Walden Briarhelm:** better

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus or Brew. Um, I What would you say, Taylor?

**Tyram:** Um, they seem very narrowly focused on like all these dragon related issues. So, I don't know if they actually have too much of a crossover with like the average Citizens of Greyport. Like it looks like they're in bit something of a turf war with the Iron Claws. Definitely like open combat in the street and all that. So, um I pro I assume they probably treated like another gang, but one that doesn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oops.

**Tyram:** like terrorize citizens the way that the other gangs probably

**Christopher Hooper:** probably more like a guild, right, that's really focused

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Tyram:** do.

**Christopher Hooper:** specifically on hunting

**Tyram:** Yeah. I guess I just been gang in the sense that

**Christopher Hooper:** dragons, right?

**Tyram:** they're like clearly outside of like the

**Christopher Hooper:** Right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Good to know. Good to

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, but I would say like they I don't think they have I think they have a mostly positive reputation rather than

**Tyram:** law probably.

**Christopher Hooper:** like Yeah, they're not like dealing drugs to fund their their dragon hunting

**Walden Briarhelm:** know.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait a minute. Double double. He's tricking

**Justin Hale:** They're definitely not doing

**Christopher Hooper:** expeditions. You're definitely not dealing

**Walden Briarhelm:** us. Got drugs and sex. So, he needs like a couple more

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Tyram:** No. I feel like this next thing was just like Toeer made up something

**Luke Neverisky:** You roll if you committed.

**Walden Briarhelm:** components. I think he's I

**Tyram:** in the heat of the moment. just decided to rush

**Justin Hale:** I mean it

**Walden Briarhelm:** think you like you got into a a

**Christopher Hooper:** drugs.

**Walden Briarhelm:** little jig soon and

**Tyram:** it. He Yes. Anded

**Walden Briarhelm:** then

**Tyram:** corner.

**Tyram:** if you walk in at night,

**Walden Briarhelm:** slayers.
