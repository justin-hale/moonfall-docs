Luke Neverisky: crazy.
Tyram: really show league, but it
Christopher Hooper: playing career. So, it's uh
Tyram: felt great to dominate my
Christopher Hooper: it's Yeah,
Tyram: opponents.
Christopher Hooper: exactly. Exactly. We all had a smile while we were crushing
Luke Neverisky: Yes. Hey man, no matter how sweaty things are, it's still comfortable. That's my
Christopher Hooper: them. How about
Luke Neverisky: take. Um, I did this
Christopher Hooper: you All
Luke Neverisky: week. Oh, I did my first, um, um, Monday was like especially s***** with like work and things, so I just did my first like, hey, f*** all this. I'm going to go just like be on the couch for like six hours straight. And that was like one of the gross. Yeah. Um, I like woke up usual time, took the dog out, and then just like got a
Christopher Hooper: right.
Luke Neverisky: blanket, called the cancel some meetings and
Christopher Hooper: Nice. That sounds
Luke Neverisky: just feel great. I'm lucky enough to be able to do
Tyram: Is Luke coming in kind of
Luke Neverisky: that.
Tyram: uh muffled a bit for anybody
Christopher Hooper: fun.
Tyram: else?
Christopher Hooper: Choppy. He He's been a little choppy for me.
Luke Neverisky: Sorry. Uh, hang on.
Tyram: Okay. I didn't mean to offend him.
Christopher Hooper: Okay, I'm glad he
Tyram: Yeah. f*** Luke. Oh
Luke Neverisky: Any good? Yeah, not
Tyram: s***. No. Oh, but hey, how's it going?
Luke Neverisky: bad. Noise. I still sound
Christopher Hooper: left. Um, I don't know yet.
Luke Neverisky: choppy. Yes. All
Tyram: Are
Ali Leonard: Good.
Luke Neverisky: right. What up, Katie?
Tyram: you kidding? We had our parent teacher conferences today.
Christopher Hooper: Oh
Tyram: Oh, it wasn't so
Christopher Hooper: no. Oh, okay.
Tyram: bad.
Ali Leonard: parents are the
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Tyram: Yeah, I do always dread like some parent
Christopher Hooper: Good. Yeah.
Tyram: coming in and like laying into me, but it hasn't happened yet. So
Ali Leonard: worst.
Tyram: uh it's become a smaller fear.
Ali Leonard: Knock on
Christopher Hooper: Yeah, that's
Ali Leonard: wood.
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Are they So like I haven't thought about parent teacher
Tyram: So I it'd be weird
Christopher Hooper: good. Yeah, makes
Luke Neverisky: conferences in a while because I was a
Tyram: if you had honestly.
Christopher Hooper: sense.
Luke Neverisky: student.
Tyram: Yeah.
Luke Neverisky: Um is it like do you get like rotating like 15 minute one-on- ones with each pair? Like
Tyram: Our school's weird um because we're
Luke Neverisky: how does that how does that work?
Tyram: a one-on-one with all the students. So um there's few enough parents that um all the teachers can meet with the parents at once or like
Luke Neverisky: Oh.
Tyram: each kids parents like all their teachers get in the room with them and we all just talk at once or you know we take turns talking of course but like
Luke Neverisky: Mhm. Gotcha.
Tyram: you know we have we all share the room as we do. Um yeah, I think in a more typical setting,
Luke Neverisky: Okay. Got it. Okay.
Tyram: um there's like a much there's like a lot of parents and one teacher in a room and like the parents move from room to
Ali Leonard: Yeah, that's what
Luke Neverisky: Uh,
Tyram: room. Although I guess
Ali Leonard: I remember my parents
Luke Neverisky: okay.
Tyram: at smaller schools there might be more like private meetings I guess between teachers or and parents. But I don't know.
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. All
Ali Leonard: doing.
Tyram: At most public schools, it's probably just completely
Christopher Hooper: right.
Tyram: impractical to try to do that. So, they probably just do like uh the what's that stupid thing with like one liberal person has to debate like 50 conservative people at the same time. It's probably more like that in most parent
Luke Neverisky: Oh yeah, it's
Tyram: teacher conferences.
Luke Neverisky: Yes,
Tyram: I never actually watched
Luke Neverisky: those I've only seen one of them and uh it was pretty a
Tyram: one, but like the premise seems
Ali Leonard: Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: Well, I mean,
Luke Neverisky: lot. Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: I think it I think that's probably the only way that that debate is fair. you know,
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Go
Tyram: absurd.
Christopher Hooper: like you you need to really stack the cards uh against the liberal arguments.
Luke Neverisky: on. Got
Tyram: I guess that's
Luke Neverisky: it. You gota Yeah. You got to play quantity as
Christopher Hooper: So, yeah, you got to
Luke Neverisky: opposed to quality or something.
Christopher Hooper: use other tap tactics like overwhelming your enemy
Tyram: fair. Another favorite is just like being in
Christopher Hooper: and that sort of thing.
Tyram: exclusive control of the microphone, right? So like you just
Luke Neverisky: Yeah, that's what I
Tyram: can cut them off mid-sentence and like redirect whatever it is you're talking about or is it
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Tyram: might always might otherwise be called the Charlie Kirk
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Tyram: method.
Christopher Hooper: RIP
Luke Neverisky: Sure.
Tyram: Sure. Oh man. Oh man. Spotify was mad last week.
Luke Neverisky: Well, our podcast is a good place.
Tyram: Wow. Maybe maybe cut this part from
Christopher Hooper: No, they don't. They do not give a
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Where's the doodle?
Christopher Hooper: s*** about anything unless you are even have one little snippet of a song that is in their
Tyram: recording. Yeah. Although I do think it is interesting that like the
Christopher Hooper: registry. Then you're on their
Tyram: national conversation has completely pivot moved
Christopher Hooper: turf.
Tyram: completely away from Charlie Kirk now, right? Like it seems to
Christopher Hooper: Oh yeah,
Luke Neverisky: I'm talking about
Tyram: me like that I'm sure, but like it
Christopher Hooper: that was always going to last a week,
Luke Neverisky: balls.
Tyram: seems like conservatives thought they had like a really strong thing there. So they it seemed like they were gearing up for a long haul, but maybe they just realized that
Christopher Hooper: right?
Tyram: they didn't and so they just they just dropped it, you know? At least maybe that just
Christopher Hooper: I I think it's I think find it very funny that like this
Tyram: seems
Christopher Hooper: uh east wing thing is like such a dramatic thing cuz I like do
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Tyram: I don't have a personal attachment
Christopher Hooper: not give a
Tyram: to the east wing of the White House myself, but
Christopher Hooper: s***.
Tyram: the unilateral like upheaval of something that is not his f****** house, you know, is the principle of the thing here, you
Christopher Hooper: Well, presidents have done that all the
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Tyram: know?
Christopher Hooper: time. Like they like, you know, different presidents have had their like crazy ideas on the uh White House all the time. Hey, can you say hi to our neighbor? Hello.
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Maybe the differentiating factor is one is straight up demolition versus
Tyram: Yeah, like there's distinguishing factors here
Luke Neverisky: like remodeling or
Tyram: to be sure. Like the the extent of it as well. Apparently what they're building is bigger than the f****** White House itself, like by tens of thousands of square
Luke Neverisky: something. Um
Tyram: feet.
Christopher Hooper: Well, you know,
Luke Neverisky: yeah.
Christopher Hooper: I just can't believe Jim Jim Cooper put solar panels on the on the White else. I mean, I'm sure I'm sure somehow this will uh lead to Trump enriching
Tyram: Bastard. I'm sure. I mean, it might just end up being just like creative accounting, right? Like apparently
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Tyram: uh all the all the billionaire types are donating money to the ballroom and you know oh I guess maybe uh
Christopher Hooper: himself. You're
Tyram: not all of it got spent or something you
Christopher Hooper: right. Right. Did everyone get a chance to uh put their purples in in
Tyram: know okay
Christopher Hooper: the bag of
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Tyram: bag of lies. What does that mean in more plain
Christopher Hooper: lies?
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Tyram: terms? Because I'm not sure what that's supposed to
Christopher Hooper: Uh, one bag only tells lies and one bag only tells
Tyram: be. Is one like the short-term wish list, the other one the long term? I just I'd like to understand what that means.
Christopher Hooper: truth. Um, it doesn't really matter to me.
Tyram: I think I
Christopher Hooper: Um, I just want to know what things you
Tyram: added the stuff that I want already,
Christopher Hooper: want.
Tyram: but you said like
Christopher Hooper: I mostly care uh
Walden Briarhelm: Did we All
Christopher Hooper: about um so I only care about you putting things that you aren't allowed to buy which are rarer and
Walden Briarhelm: right.
Tyram: legend. Okay.
Christopher Hooper: more
Tyram: Um All right.
Christopher Hooper: things. But if you also want to use it as a way to track like a
Tyram: All right. Um, I put an
Christopher Hooper: a shopping list or whatever, uh you can
Tyram: uncommon thing and a rare thing. My rare thing was the uh amulet of
Christopher Hooper: use
Tyram: health because Silus is got so so few hit points. It's it's kind of alarming. Here, I'll look around.
Christopher Hooper: I I don't understand for some reason some items I can't find in my in my search. It's so odd. I don't know if it I feel like maybe it's like a uh sources thing. Feel weird. I don't get it.
Tyram: I didn't pick
Christopher Hooper: I think it might be I think it might be because of I think for some reason I can't
Tyram: up.
Christopher Hooper: find items that are in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. I'm wondering if it's because of like
Luke Neverisky: That
Christopher Hooper: uh I might have like like it may I maybe considered a legacy
Tyram: Oh,
Christopher Hooper: item cuz there cuz I did see one of the items someone
Luke Neverisky: sounds
Christopher Hooper: put in was a legacy item and I updated it.
Tyram: maybe
Walden Briarhelm: Can you guys hear
Tyram: Yes. Oh, were you talking
Christopher Hooper: Now we
Luke Neverisky: I hear

Christopher Hooper: Yes.
Walden Briarhelm: fantasy. I saw um something
Christopher Hooper: Fantasy.
Walden Briarhelm: somewhere and it was the typical rhyme of a lizard wizard and I was like is there one for all of the different I guess I would say standard classes that rhyme that are
Luke Neverisky: Is it a
Walden Briarhelm: fun and uh some of them are not easy. Some of them are paladin rhymes with a bunch of stuff. My personal favorite was a paragrin paladin pee
Luke Neverisky: candy?
Walden Briarhelm: pe. But lizard is so simple. So I don't know if paragrin is
Christopher Hooper: Are you talking about that band? The lizard wizard band.
Luke Neverisky: Yeah, I can't wizard and the lizard
Walden Briarhelm: appropriate. I was not, but we can definitely segue. I feel like that's appropriate. It means It means people are in in the zone
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: here. At some point, I will be eating food hopefully tonight, but we'll
Christopher Hooper: Okay. Nice.
Luke Neverisky: wizard jealous.
Walden Briarhelm: see. So, looking forward to

Luke Neverisky: bills
Christopher Hooper: wizard. I was trying not to make another int based
Luke Neverisky: here.
Walden Briarhelm: wizard.
Christopher Hooper: character, but it really doesn't make sense for her not to be
Tyram: Is she a sorcerer right
Christopher Hooper: in based. Yeah, she's a sorcerer. had like I I made her a clockwork sorcerer which is like kind of thematically on but like I don't know it
Tyram: now?
Christopher Hooper: could be okay or could be all right. Yeah, it could be. Yeah. It's just
Walden Briarhelm: Everybody's healthy this week. Sorry,
Christopher Hooper: so uh Yeah, I think
Walden Briarhelm: don't mean to interrupt, Tucker. Seems like
Christopher Hooper: so. Really?
Walden Briarhelm: everybody is sick right now.
Christopher Hooper: I was down a couple weeks
Walden Briarhelm: Yeah, I guess I should say it's everybody who has like school age children because the school children are spreading it all around, I
Christopher Hooper: ago. Yeah. Daycare kids get it first and then we spread it to the older older
Walden Briarhelm: guess. And then perpetuate
Christopher Hooper: kids.
Walden Briarhelm: that bug for months
Christopher Hooper: Mhm. Yep.
Walden Briarhelm: apparently. You're training the super bug. We have the
Christopher Hooper: We have big children. We can breed
Ali Leonard: I'm going to a two-year-old's birthday party
Walden Briarhelm: technology. We're going to
Tyram: Oh yeah,

Walden Briarhelm: awesome. That's
Christopher Hooper: Oh, it's actually
Ali Leonard: Ratatouille. I
Luke Neverisky: nice
Walden Briarhelm: fun. I am envious. That
Tyram: I
Christopher Hooper: really funny to do like birthdays at that age
Ali Leonard: know.
Walden Briarhelm: sounds
Christopher Hooper: because like they just so overwhelmed by any group larger than like four, especially if they're adults. So, it's
Ali Leonard: It's literally all Rosemary's friend, like her mom's
Luke Neverisky: Same
Tyram: feel
Christopher Hooper: like
Ali Leonard: friends. So, it's like 10 older women and then just
Walden Briarhelm: fun.
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. Okay.
Ali Leonard: Audrey. And Audrey's usually really chill. Like, every time I've hung out with Audrey, she's just been like, "Great, let's do it. Let's hang out,
Christopher Hooper: All right. Maybe she's just
Ali Leonard: guys. We're doing it. Who's gonna play
Christopher Hooper: mature for her
Ali Leonard: with me? I think so. But I don't know very many two-year-olds.
Christopher Hooper: age. Mhm. Well, I know a few and I can tell you they get overwhelmed by groups most of the time.
Ali Leonard: So, she's very chill about just like, "Cool. I'm just going to go over here and knock on some doors and flip some switches."
Christopher Hooper: Yeah,
Ali Leonard: Y'all cool with that?
Christopher Hooper: that sounds
Ali Leonard: When
Walden Briarhelm: Do two-year-olds do sidewalk chalk
Christopher Hooper: right. A little
Walden Briarhelm: or am I a little early? Yeah, I was going to say I think they need to be a little older. Sidewalk chalk, that age is like my favorite age because you can just sit there and draw spirals for like six hours and kids love it.
Christopher Hooper: early.
Walden Briarhelm: Six hours is dramatic. uh like 20
Ali Leonard: she It's so hard to get a
Luke Neverisky: You'll
Walden Briarhelm: minutes. At that age, they don't want to do anything very
Ali Leonard: present for this age for me cuz I'm like
Walden Briarhelm: long. Uh it's red, too. You get a
Christopher Hooper: Just give them just give
Walden Briarhelm: chef hat.
Christopher Hooper: them like a piece of cardboard or like a book. Like that's all a
Ali Leonard: Well, I always get

Luke Neverisky: Oh
Christopher Hooper: power. Oh, okay.
Ali Leonard: board that has like switches that you flip and like

Ali Leonard: mean.
Luke Neverisky: The DJ
Tyram: add uh winged boots to the list here.
Ali Leonard: You want all of us to fly again?
Luke Neverisky: diaper. Yeah. Zach, do you uh hoist

Walden Briarhelm: Uh, Luke. Oh, I'm sorry. Master Luke, now that I can see you, I don't want to be informal. Uh, you asked a question. I heard you start a question. At least I was talking. I don't know what you asked. You and you are on mute
Luke Neverisky: It's just like
Walden Briarhelm: now. Foolish
Luke Neverisky: work all over
Walden Briarhelm: meeting. Oh, no. This is great in

Walden Briarhelm: comparison. This is already better. Oh yeah. I was going to go do legs and I got there was like Jesus. I'm gonna I'm not going to get to start until 5:15. Like I got an hour
Luke Neverisky: today.
Walden Briarhelm: basically to try to get everything done. Like I need more time. So I'll try to lift when I have the availability. I look forward to it. Instead I did chest. It was boring.
Luke Neverisky: Oh, you got you got kids
Walden Briarhelm: There was like three people there.
Luke Neverisky: in your squat
Walden Briarhelm: How about you? Did you Did you get to do a little pick it up, put it
Luke Neverisky: rack. Yeah, I pulled it primarily.
Walden Briarhelm: down? Oh, nice. Also cut that from the uh recording. We
Christopher Hooper: Okay, I
Walden Briarhelm: were just figuring out what dinner is going to be. Oh.
Christopher Hooper: realized to make it fair, I think everyone should put one thing in the container that tells lies and one thing in the container that tells
Walden Briarhelm: Are you telling us to limit it to
Christopher Hooper: truth. We'll say at least
Luke Neverisky: at least
Walden Briarhelm: only one?
Luke Neverisky: one. Okay. And uh it has to be
Walden Briarhelm: Oh, okay.
Christopher Hooper: one.
Luke Neverisky: green green text or white text, right?
Walden Briarhelm: Okay. Green or
Christopher Hooper: No, it has to be blue text or purple
Luke Neverisky: No. Okay. Got it. That's I did
Walden Briarhelm: blue?
Tyram: Okay, my blue thing is this amulet of health
Luke Neverisky: the inverse of what I actually meant to say.
Walden Briarhelm: Blue or
Tyram: then
Christopher Hooper: text. All right. What blue or purple thing are you going to put in the the
Luke Neverisky: Okay.
Tyram: um
Christopher Hooper: container of
Tyram: Um, it's I still wish I knew what that meant.
Luke Neverisky: I don't know what the
Christopher Hooper: lies?
Luke Neverisky: there should
Walden Briarhelm: the special extra fun DM thing that I'm just living about. I'm liking this quite a
Tyram: Um,
Christopher Hooper: Yeah, I'm I
Luke Neverisky: prioritize
Walden Briarhelm: bit. Just extra
Christopher Hooper: got to keep you on your toes. Just like whoever put in Diablo sauce is keeping me on my toes.
Walden Briarhelm: mystery. I got to do
Christopher Hooper: Oh, how'd it
Walden Briarhelm: an hour of dagger heart earlier this week. pretty good. Uh I am enjoying it.
Christopher Hooper: go? Hello,
Tyram: Oops. Oh no.
Christopher Hooper: Justin.
Justin Hale: Oh,
Christopher Hooper: Yep. He's
Justin Hale: hello. What's a How do What's a purple
Christopher Hooper: there.
Justin Hale: item? What's a blue item? How do I search for these?
Christopher Hooper: Um, just put in in the search bar, put in purple. And then yeah, choose what? Choose
Justin Hale: Wondrous. Okay. Purple. Purple
Christopher Hooper: that. Yep. And uh
Justin Hale: worm poison injury. Okay.
Christopher Hooper: have brew take
Luke Neverisky: nice. We did take
Christopher Hooper: that.
Luke Neverisky: do poison already.
Justin Hale: Right. Yeah. I got PTSD from poison. This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. Do I want to know
Christopher Hooper: Mhm. That looks pretty good.
Justin Hale: where this comes from? This sounds kind
Walden Briarhelm: Oh
Tyram: Okay, this looks pretty cool for Syos. I'll put this down. Um, cloak of
Justin Hale: of
Walden Briarhelm: yeah.
Tyram: arachnida. Basically, it just lets me like walk up walls and
Luke Neverisky: So
Tyram: s***. Yeah, it's very rare.
Christopher Hooper: Nice. Oh,
Walden Briarhelm: That's
Tyram: It also gives me poison resistance and
Christopher Hooper: nice.
Tyram: uh lets me cast
Walden Briarhelm: awesome. This
Tyram: web. That'd be really good for
Walden Briarhelm: feels You turn into Spider-Man with this cloak. You're already like
Tyram: Silus just because um it gives me more,
Walden Briarhelm: super
Tyram: you know, like mobility and
Walden Briarhelm: agile. Like do you have advantage on being hidden if you're stuck to the ceiling? Like people
Tyram: stuff. Um in battle I have advantage on hiding
Walden Briarhelm: don't look up
Tyram: anyway because I have
Christopher Hooper: Um, but that's a that would be an interesting
Walden Briarhelm: often. Oh, okay.
Tyram: curfe
Christopher Hooper: ruling. I think probably it I think a little bit you need to have a good stealth check in the first place
Walden Briarhelm: Sure, if you're wearing plate armor, even if you're walking on the ceiling, it's going to
Christopher Hooper: because Right. Right. Like if you're on the ceiling,
Walden Briarhelm: be pretty obvious, but what you mean
Christopher Hooper: it could make you more seen, right? Cuz like very few things are going to be
Walden Briarhelm: it? Sure.
Christopher Hooper: covering your your view. But I think there's also the flip side of you could be like totally unnoticed because no one looks up.
Walden Briarhelm: Sure. I think it would really depend on the building as well. The one where you had the laser robots forming orbs out of the
Tyram: Yeah. Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: crystal like that was high up in the air. So that would be useless there. You
Tyram: It definitely is like a it's a very
Walden Briarhelm: would be looking
Tyram: situational ruling, you know, like is it a is it some place
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: up. Be
Tyram: where people would have a good reason to look up or is there like, you know, if it's just like a factory or something like that where people don't expect s*** on the ceiling, then like, you know, yeah, I'll
Walden Briarhelm: fun. But
Tyram: just
Walden Briarhelm: dagger dagger heart is fun to the thing I only thing I wanted to share is when you are
Christopher Hooper: Uh
Walden Briarhelm: DMing just spending a fear just just
Christopher Hooper: uh-huh. Good. bad. How does it
Walden Briarhelm: that like it's great if you have extra cuz nobody as
Christopher Hooper: feel?
Walden Briarhelm: a player wants the DM to have any. Like they're like I don't want you to ever have any.
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: I'm like, well then it wouldn't really be much of a back and forth. But just to spend one
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: when you have like five just to like change the mood, it's
Christopher Hooper: Uhhuh. Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: a good feeling. I was like, okay, that can definitely be useful just to set the tone because then they are like, oh something, this
Christopher Hooper: And and I think in the
Walden Briarhelm: isn't a happy moment. This is scary, maybe.
Christopher Hooper: DM uh guidance they they actually talk about like how much fear uh like how using fear during combat like scales the the combat which is really fascinating. Um, like I think I think they said like if
Walden Briarhelm: Oh, I guess I see what you
Christopher Hooper: you're using three fear in your combat that be that makes it deadly for a typical party. Um, which is like that's
Walden Briarhelm: Oh, you you mean you take you do three actions
Christopher Hooper: cool. No, like uh during an
Walden Briarhelm: in a row? Like in a single turn you go fear fear fear?
Christopher Hooper: encounter. Um, yeah. So like you're already taking your normal so so you already get to take your normal action but then using a fear right you can like go again or or make something worse or something like that.
Walden Briarhelm: Yeah. Right.
Christopher Hooper: Uh and so I think that they have had balance on as well which is like um the amount of fear you use in an encounter like calculates to like how deadly that encounter
Walden Briarhelm: I haven't done that yet. I will keep it in
Tyram: Since I added that cloak, I guess I'll switch my cloak of protection that I added to a ring of
Christopher Hooper: is. You don't want to wear two
Walden Briarhelm: marked. What is a
Tyram: protection. If you let me wear two cloaks, I'll wear two
Christopher Hooper: cloaks.
Tyram: cloaks. I
Christopher Hooper: I think that'd be pretty
Luke Neverisky: Uh, you also
Walden Briarhelm: can?
Tyram: mean, sure. Yeah, that could be Silus's thing. He just is like layers and layers of
Luke Neverisky: need
Christopher Hooper: cool. Astrid
Ali Leonard: Just have one cloak on the front and one cloak on the
Walden Briarhelm: Oh.
Christopher Hooper: wears
Ali Leonard: back. Can
Luke Neverisky: a business cloak and party
Christopher Hooper: Ash usually wears a dress and a tutu.
Ali Leonard: you shorten the quote? There you go.
Luke Neverisky: cloak.
Tyram: cloaks. I mean, Silus is
Christopher Hooper: So
Tyram: more concerned about uh function over style. So, sure, I'll wear two
Christopher Hooper: later.
Walden Briarhelm: Megan
Tyram: folks.
Walden Briarhelm: Megan's character is a rogue and she is a raccoon rogue and her attire is scraps of different magical things. Uh, so there's like a chance to use them. So she
Christopher Hooper: Um
Walden Briarhelm: has a cloak that's got like a little bit of fabric from an invisibility cloak, a little bit of fabric from a cloak that lets you jump, another one that lets you do like special things. And uh they don't just restore um via long rest or anything. You have to do something special to make them reusable because it allows for some pretty
Justin Hale: It'd be better if it did all those things just really
Walden Briarhelm: powerful stuff up front. uh like a like a wild
Justin Hale: s*****.
Walden Briarhelm: magic. Like you cast invisibility but then you have to
Justin Hale: Like instead of invisibility, it was only like you were
Walden Briarhelm: roll like a
Tyram: One of my favorite environmental hazards to do
Justin Hale: translucent. If instead of long stride, you only move like
Walden Briarhelm: detail. I
Tyram: is like set up situations where the wild magic table just goes off for
Justin Hale: one foot faster.
Tyram: after like certain actions that you
Walden Briarhelm: uh I do like this. I know that you have more experience than me because I didn't even consider like half effective every ability that that cloak or in general her whole attire looks like. She looks like a
Tyram: take. If you want to be really hardcore, you could make an environmental situation
Walden Briarhelm: a typical person that's out on the
Tyram: where stuff from like the deck of many things might happen at random
Justin Hale: That would be
Walden Briarhelm: street. Okay.
Tyram: moments. I will tell you that is way way worse at least potentially than the wild magic
Justin Hale: fun. Yeah, but
Christopher Hooper: bigger
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Yeah. Come
Justin Hale: that's way more
Tyram: table.
Christopher Hooper: swings.
Luke Neverisky: on.
Justin Hale: fun.
Christopher Hooper: I want to get started,
Walden Briarhelm: Oh, wow. Yeah, some of these are
Tyram: Well, there's at least three in there just that basically just instantly end your
Walden Briarhelm: crazy. Yeah, minus 10,000 experience. Typical.
Tyram: character.
Luke Neverisky: f***.
Christopher Hooper: but um I want I want to get started. But um Ellis,
Walden Briarhelm: Do you want to go the whole three
Christopher Hooper: yeah, let's give it three minutes.
Justin Hale: Is
Christopher Hooper: We're so
Justin Hale: this a thing?
Walden Briarhelm: minute the mandolin that Luke put into the
Christopher Hooper: close.
Luke Neverisky: off. And
Walden Briarhelm: uh bag of truth.
Christopher Hooper: Yep.
Walden Briarhelm: That's really cool. I'm imagining you
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: have like the song of fly, the song of dispel magic, the song like almost a Zelda inspired
Luke Neverisky: yeah,
Walden Briarhelm: like that's really what the f*** is protection from Oh, lightning damage.
Christopher Hooper: What strength is Ma right now? Is it
Justin Hale: Okay.
Walden Briarhelm: Gotcha.
Christopher Hooper: 20? Okay, so the giant bow would only increase it. I mean, five is a
Walden Briarhelm: Yeah. Five. I know. I I just don't know. Like I
Christopher Hooper: lot.
Walden Briarhelm: thought is there a increase your dexterity like there is increase your strength? So like a belt
Tyram: There are quite a few belts that
Christopher Hooper: Um, no. I think that's
Walden Briarhelm: of giant
Tyram: make you stronger.
Christopher Hooper: pretty but none that make you faster,
Walden Briarhelm: dextrous.
Tyram: Yes. No, but the belt of giant strength is and like there's certain items in the DMG that I would call like template items. Like I can't I don't know a reason why you couldn't just make a belt that does the same thing for your decks or like
Christopher Hooper: right? I
Tyram: make a sword that does like ice damage instead of fire damage like flame tongue
Christopher Hooper: I think the reason though, but isn't isn't strength like one of the worst uh like
Tyram: does. Well, it's hugely
Christopher Hooper: game mechanic skills? Um
Walden Briarhelm: It's not used often.
Tyram: important for a lot of classes though. Like there's classes like barbarian, paladin, and uh fighter where their strength is by far their most important stat, you
Christopher Hooper: like Yeah. Yeah. But it's not a thing that's like you're
Tyram: know. I
Christopher Hooper: you're going to strength stealth your way
Tyram: guess yeah, okay, that there's a it strength is less useful for skills.
Christopher Hooper: through like
Tyram: That is true. And it's also true that um um strength doesn't do anything for your AC like dexterity would. So yeah. Hey
Christopher Hooper: We can't hear you, but hopefully you can hear
Tyram: brother. First
Christopher Hooper: us. One minute. One second. I'm so frazzled. Ted is so mad at
Walden Briarhelm: first two syllables.
Tyram: word is it
Christopher Hooper: me.
Luke Neverisky: Right.
Walden Briarhelm: She left him in the tub again. He'll be
Tyram: movie TV show?
Christopher Hooper: Um worried, concerned. Oh, you
Walden Briarhelm: okay. I think this series is
Christopher Hooper: definitely look
Walden Briarhelm: funny.
Tyram: What?
Justin Hale: stressed, anxious, determined,
Christopher Hooper: concerned. Um touchcreen.
Justin Hale: focused.
Walden Briarhelm: Such
Christopher Hooper: Um the the the six the six sense of touch
Walden Briarhelm: wow silhouette portrait
Christopher Hooper: frozen
Walden Briarhelm: lag. Inconceivable.
Christopher Hooper: incomprehensible I just need Ellis to be able to hear so she can learn about what we did last time. It's all I need.
Ellis Taylor: Okay,
Tyram: Hell
Christopher Hooper: So close. Oh, there you go. That's
Ellis Taylor: I'm here now. We're good. I'm sorry. That was a lot of
Tyram: yeah. All right. Take that,
Christopher Hooper: okay. Yeah, I know the
Justin Hale: Wait,
Christopher Hooper: feeling. All
Tyram: Justin.
Christopher Hooper: right, cool. Let's get
Justin Hale: what? I'm adding this as a chaotic
Christopher Hooper: going. Um,
Ellis Taylor: drama. Are we shopping? What's
Justin Hale: item. Yes.
Tyram: Oper told us to all pick like a rare or very rare item to add
Christopher Hooper: yes.
Ellis Taylor: happening?
Justin Hale: Yes.
Tyram: to the uh the tell lies and tells the truth
Ellis Taylor: Oh, we got to pick an
Walden Briarhelm: You were just gone on our only shopping day. That was
Tyram: bags.
Ellis Taylor: item. I didn't realize we were picking an item. I thought it
Walden Briarhelm: the shopping session.
Ellis Taylor: was just uh I didn't understand why we were sticking stuff we already
Christopher Hooper: Oh, no. This is
Ellis Taylor: had in the bag.
Christopher Hooper: uh things that you would
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: like. Uh you can do it
Ellis Taylor: Well, I've got to do that now. Oh
Christopher Hooper: later. Um all right, cool.
Ellis Taylor: well, I'll do it later.
Christopher Hooper: Um let's talk about last
Luke Neverisky: All
Tyram: I would
Christopher Hooper: session. Any Does anyone want to give a a recap? We get some
Tyram: like someone who wasn't in on the the scheme to do
Christopher Hooper: inspiration for
Tyram: the recap this
Christopher Hooper: you. Yeah, that'd be great.
Ellis Taylor: Yeah, that'd be great.
Tyram: week.
Christopher Hooper: So, Luke, uh, Ally, or Zach,
Ellis Taylor: That was wild.
Walden Briarhelm: What was the first thing that started
Tyram: Um, Chalk
Ali Leonard: Idiot
Luke Neverisky: right.
Walden Briarhelm: the session last
Tyram: Rock. Yeah, Chalk Rock showed up and is like, "Hey, they have a bunch
Christopher Hooper: um,
Ali Leonard: Mcdoke us
Tyram: of like they have every likable person you've met since the beginning of the campaign uh captured in the Great
Ali Leonard: up. Weren't
Tyram: Hall." No, we
Christopher Hooper: No, you
Ali Leonard: we in Olivia's
Tyram: were hanging out at uh the pizza
Christopher Hooper: were
Ali Leonard: apartment? Pizza place. For
Walden Briarhelm: time? Right.
Tyram: place. No, living apartment had
Ali Leonard: some reason, I thought we were in Olivia's apartment and I was like, Jock, why are you in
Walden Briarhelm: Ah, yes.
Tyram: a bunch of a-holes uh living there
Ali Leonard: here? Oh, right. That was the week before.
Walden Briarhelm: That is
Christopher Hooper: in
Walden Briarhelm: accurate. So, uh, there's a commotion outside and all of the the players are awoken by our least favorite NPC based on crowd vote. And he's letting us know that the ironclaws are outside and they have
Tyram: now.
Walden Briarhelm: got hostages that they are apparently just holding out on the street as like a opportunity to see what kind of bad they're about to do. And uh we take our very sweet time discussing several topics on our way uh down the stairs to go outside. And as we finally make our way out, we witness what was described by Taylor just a moment ago, which was uh we see so many of the uh friendly NPCs that we've encountered since the beginning of the campaign. each uh is imprisoned in a cell and uh that is in a very specific kind of arena that is over top of lava. And uh there are guards at each of these uh gated uh cells and uh what would you would expect to be maybe a a stealth attempt to sneak up and take care of the guards would occur or something else. But instead, we uh we began with what was going to be sneaking past a stage that is being set up for the uh now nonlukeana to perform. And uh it just turned into kick everybody off of the uh the structure that we're on and into the lava. I think uh several
Luke Neverisky: You're
Walden Briarhelm: guards just got one hit KO just from a simple push. Uh others I think Silas just did his normal dagger
Justin Hale: Yeah,
Walden Briarhelm: ripage and killed. Uh but we we
Luke Neverisky: eating
Walden Briarhelm: rescued several people and some were uh some were incapacitated
Justin Hale: b****.
Walden Briarhelm: and brought back due to uh Liliana and her
Tyram: Um, one of the people we did save was George. Um, and the only one
Ellis Taylor: ripage. I saw that.
Tyram: who died was Kathern Corwin, but f*** her, you
Walden Briarhelm: abilities.
Tyram: know. Oh, sorry, Lady
Ellis Taylor: Yeah. Wait. Captain Corin or Lady
Walden Briarhelm: Yeah. Lady Coral is a
Tyram: Corwin. My
Luke Neverisky: Yay. Triple
Ellis Taylor: Corwin? Okay. But Captain was the bad
Walden Briarhelm: jerk. Let her
Luke Neverisky: C.
Ellis Taylor: guy.
Walden Briarhelm: rip. So we uh after after taking hold of that situation, I I don't know if we moved forward or if the map uh then showed that there was uh some characters who have joined like a uh a blast from the past. We
Tyram: mistake.
Walden Briarhelm: saw Oh, I don't want to forget his name, but you're not allowed to tell us, Toper.
Christopher Hooper: Okay, very
Walden Briarhelm: Grim Jaw, the uh the big baddy that we had a poisonous gas fight with in the past had returned as like a ultra grim jaw version. And uh as we were
Christopher Hooper: good.
Walden Briarhelm: preparing and discussing how we were going to take on this uh this monster of a baddie, Silus just kind of step forth and starts negotiating. And uh he he performs an act that kind of takes everybody by surprise. And I want to pass the baton to somebody who uh was also
Justin Hale: Is it that surprising?
Walden Briarhelm: there and gets to take the highlight moment. I had no clue what was going on. I was taken by
Christopher Hooper: Ally seemed very
Ellis Taylor: when I
Walden Briarhelm: surprise if that means
Justin Hale: though. It's surprising but not like
Walden Briarhelm: anything.
Ellis Taylor: read it's brute. I mean, if it had been somebody else, like
Justin Hale: unexpected,
Ellis Taylor: if he'd shot Anybody
Christopher Hooper: surprised.
Ellis Taylor: else? That'd be less surprising.
Walden Briarhelm: So, well, since we
Luke Neverisky: Sugar.
Justin Hale: right?
Walden Briarhelm: know about it, I mean, Silus takes uh takes an opportunity to stab Brew and we watch him fall and drop incapacitated as though that was uh intended the entire time. And uh after a bit more back and forth, we we follow Grim Jaw and his lackeyis and the rest of the group. Uh leaves potions with Boxbox and with uh Kevin. Toeer, would you
Christopher Hooper: I'm Kevin.
Walden Briarhelm: uh and we we have uh the crying sounds of Kevin as he watches the the dying body of Brew continue to to collapse. And uh we move forward and we enter what what do we want to call it? a great chamber that
Christopher Hooper: the for
Walden Briarhelm: we've been uh we've been hearing of all this construction going
Christopher Hooper: chart or or are you in the grey
Walden Briarhelm: on the forge
Christopher Hooper: hall? Is that what you're talking
Walden Briarhelm: part we have I'm thinking at this point we have moved forward into the uh the map of eight stairwells
Christopher Hooper: about? Okay. Uh and what what so Silus stabbed Brew um and then started trying to negotiate,
Walden Briarhelm: Yeah, he he he kind of took like a he took an
Christopher Hooper: right?
Walden Briarhelm: opportunity to do an action of force and like just took a life just to show he's serious and that uh I guess that wasn't enough for them to go, "Oh yeah, this guy, he doesn't care about anything. He's trying to talk about money. He's talking about power. He's ready to talk
Christopher Hooper: Hello.
Walden Briarhelm: with the big dog." So, I think that worked as a way to uh get us in the door, so to speak. And uh behind us we leave Brew and we enter into the the big boss's room where we see several people up several
Christopher Hooper: Hello.
Walden Briarhelm: flights of stairs that just continue to go up and up and up to a a massive throne where we see Helga waiting. And Silas along with the group and tow slowly follows all the way up the stairs and leads us slowly into a almost a dangerous situation where the guards of Helga are all standing around us and we're all just kind of hanging out while Silas just negotiates like a m***********. Meanwhile, while we are all very busy discussing and distracted, in the background, Brew has uh stood up and dusted himself off. Very proud of himself. He did a great job acting that 20 performance, if you would. And uh he gets busy. He is while all this is going down and Silus is, as we've discussed, taking his time. He's being very, you know, uh what's
Ellis Taylor: That's the room.
Walden Briarhelm: Give me some words, guys. There's there's an art to what he is he is he is speaking with a lot of tone and he's taking his time being patient drawing this out really making but but never repeating himself really making a point because at the same time Brew is sneaking around setting up bombs all around us and all but uh Silas has no idea that Brew is even alive right now. We all thought we were may have seen him for the last time. And uh I do want to pass this because the ending is pretty exciting. Silas makes his way all the way up to Helga to finish his negotiations. Uh Luke or Ally, you guys want to share what
Luke Neverisky: He f****** stabs
Walden Briarhelm: happens? Not and not just any stab like
Luke Neverisky: Ela.
Walden Briarhelm: this is a he is going for death. This isn't just your friendly neighborhood
Luke Neverisky: Well,
Walden Briarhelm: stabbing. Yeah, this is this is for lethality. He's he's really going for it. And uh if I recall, I don't I don't remember all the details at this point. I was pretty tired, but I do recall that uh Ela is uh taken down very quickly. Sorry, I'm following along in the Google chat. And
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: uh the lackey surrounding us start uh to do something interesting. They each have rings and it allows them to teleport away somewhere. Uh we don't know where, but we see that uh several of them have started to uh teleport out. And uh it's just a highlight moment. No bias. thinks to quickly um take off one of the teleportation rings of one of the lackeyis who had been knocked uh stunned or I don't think it was a stun. Somebody else did
Tyram: kind of dazed by Liliana's uh uh hypnotic
Walden Briarhelm: something. There we go. I was like it wasn't
Luke Neverisky: That's right. Yeah. Also
Ellis Taylor: Beauty.
Walden Briarhelm: that did it. So,
Tyram: pattern.
Luke Neverisky: that
Walden Briarhelm: uh, a little slight of hand pulled off the ring and then we, uh, we we got rid of the body by kicking her off of a pretty high ledge. But she's strong. She did not fall from, uh, well, she did fall, but she did not take much damage. She was able to stand up and even uh, attack when it was her turn. Uh, at which point though, all of these explosions start going off. I think
Tyram: The explosion started before the
Walden Briarhelm: they may have already begun.
Tyram: stabbing
Luke Neverisky: Oh,
Walden Briarhelm: Perfect. The explosions are used as part of the distraction
Luke Neverisky: right.
Walden Briarhelm: to make the stab so performant and uh perfect. So these explosions are going off and we are trying to descend this massive set of
Tyram: started.
Walden Briarhelm: stairs and avoid damage and we are on the escape. I think we've made it out of the heart of the forge and or the forge heart and we are back in the great hall
Ellis Taylor: What about the
Walden Briarhelm: escaping. Does that sound right where we left off? I'll make sure with
Tyram: We need to deal with the dragons.
Ellis Taylor: dragons?
Walden Briarhelm: Toeer. Yeah, the the dragons hasn't hasn't happened, but there was there is a whole thing I
Tyram: Um
Walden Briarhelm: missed with the dragon orb. That's probably pretty important to bring
Luke Neverisky: Okay.
Walden Briarhelm: up. Silus, you want to review that
Tyram: um Silus had a fake dragon orb with him so that
Walden Briarhelm: one? There's
Tyram: when he was standing in front of Helga um she couldn't just like kill him and like call the dragons off herself. Um, I guess we'll see where the real dragon orb is, but um, I think that was pretty much the long and short of it. I think we're about to uh leave the Yeah, like we were in the middle of leaving the forart.
Christopher Hooper: You were just about to leave the the
Tyram: We haven't gotten back to the great hall yet.
Christopher Hooper: forart. That's right. Any other any other details y'all
Luke Neverisky: Right.
Christopher Hooper: remember? Was there a
Tyram: Um, Grimshaw and Triple C did not teleport out. They ran ahead of
Luke Neverisky: Right.
Ellis Taylor: There was a concert.
Tyram: us, so we could theoretically still run into
Christopher Hooper: concert?
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Tyram: them. We killed two of the
Christopher Hooper: True.
Walden Briarhelm: There were many things going
Tyram: people. We, including Hela, we killed two of the elite iron claws. I guess they
Christopher Hooper: What happened to the to
Tyram: were.
Christopher Hooper: the
Tyram: All of them I think
Christopher Hooper: hostages?
Luke Neverisky: Yeah,
Tyram: got away except for uh Lady Corwin, but you know,
Christopher Hooper: And so um and last time you're in the great hall, there was a
Tyram: f***
Christopher Hooper: big concert going on as well.
Luke Neverisky: whatever. That's right. Yeah, Hel is being all cool and s*** and like, you know, doing the
Tyram: her.
Luke Neverisky: concept, but also like doing some blasting because she's a real bro like
Christopher Hooper: Yeah, pretty cool. Pretty
Luke Neverisky: that.
Christopher Hooper: cool. All right, I think that catches us up. Any other any questions, Ellis or anyone
Tyram: Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: else? All
Luke Neverisky: I don't think
Christopher Hooper: right.
Walden Briarhelm: I have a I do have a question. What the hell is a bag that tells lies and a bag that tells
Justin Hale: I mean, they sound pretty
Walden Briarhelm: truth? Could do we do we get to find out about
Luke Neverisky: so.
Justin Hale: self-explanatory to
Walden Briarhelm: that? Well, I mean
Tyram: Yeah. What did those
Justin Hale: me. One bag tells the truth, one bag tells a lie. What else do you need to
Walden Briarhelm: conceptually, but
Tyram: mean? They It's
Walden Briarhelm: not
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. Why don't you just ask the
Justin Hale: know? What?
Tyram: not what like what items go in
Christopher Hooper: bag? Okay. All right.
Luke Neverisky: I hate this
Tyram: which bag for one
Christopher Hooper: So, if one bag tells truth and one bag tells
Luke Neverisky: game.
Justin Hale: Right.
Christopher Hooper: lies and you need an item, how do you find out which bag to go into to get the item?
Walden Briarhelm: I would ask the bag that tells lies if the other bag does not have the item I would
Christopher Hooper: Okay. All right.
Walden Briarhelm: ask
Christopher Hooper: Well,
Walden Briarhelm: for. What? That's it. That's the answer.
Justin Hale: Hey, fun fact, when you leave
Walden Briarhelm: I'm sorry I answered for everybody.
Justin Hale: the call and come back, pin messages show back up
Christopher Hooper: cool. Oh,
Justin Hale: immediately and it's the only thing in the chat
Christopher Hooper: good. It's retained.

Justin Hale: pinned it.
Tyram: Does that mean love it when Brew dies is going to be part of our Google chat every single time we open
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Ellis Taylor: dies.
Tyram: it up
Christopher Hooper: Oh, I don't know. That's a good question.
Justin Hale: Yeah. Oh my

Ellis Taylor: to find out.
Christopher Hooper: Hopefully. All right.

Walden Briarhelm: off.
Tyram: I was so I was kind of expecting last time when I did the whole now thing for you to be like, who
Luke Neverisky: Who is
Tyram: is Yeah, I was expecting
Justin Hale: camera. It was It was too
Tyram: the Well, hey, I appreciate like keeping the
Justin Hale: pivotal. I was too
Tyram: gravitas of the situation going.
Luke Neverisky: this? Um, are you eating triple
Justin Hale: nervous.
Luke Neverisky: C? I could I could I can make I could I could
Tyram: Yeah, just like just like tell them to like
Luke Neverisky: see. Get it. Get
Tyram: go like fight alongside the golems or something. You got to make it sound reasonable,
Luke Neverisky: it. Okay, I'll
Christopher Hooper: So,
Luke Neverisky: uh I'll give it a shot.
Justin Hale: The little dragons need
Tyram: right?
Christopher Hooper: doesn't command isn't command now limited
Luke Neverisky: Um is I would
Christopher Hooper: to Okay. Okay. Cool.
Luke Neverisky: do suggestion
Christopher Hooper: Um, so one thing to keep
Luke Neverisky: instead.
Walden Briarhelm: Okay, I like that. I will go look at what that
Christopher Hooper: in mind, um, basically any of these
Justin Hale: pets.
Christopher Hooper: you, uh, can't tell them to pursue something that will
Tyram: Well,
Christopher Hooper: like directly endanger them.
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Right.
Tyram: like you can, but you can't make it sound like you're doing that. Like the
Luke Neverisky: So, not involve anything that would
Tyram: order can't sound
Luke Neverisky: obviously Right. Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: is.
Luke Neverisky: So, anything that would obviously deal damage to the target or its allies, you could say
Ellis Taylor: You should
Luke Neverisky: patch
Ellis Taylor: just tell them to go party and then they'll be stuck
Walden Briarhelm: I got a rule
Ellis Taylor: in the fight and have to Eight.
Walden Briarhelm: question. That's That's great. What would be the ruling
Tyram: suicidal.
Walden Briarhelm: there? I go out there and party.
Christopher Hooper: Um, I I think I think that would probably work. Um because because they could they would probably try to get
Luke Neverisky: the
Christopher Hooper: by without getting hurt, which is feasible just as it's feasible for
Walden Briarhelm: Okay. My other question is what if you told somebody like uh the suggestion being I want you to go try to sneak out of here and then just
Christopher Hooper: you.
Walden Briarhelm: watch how well they're able to sneak. Like is that okay? You're telling them
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. Yeah, I think
Walden Briarhelm: literally try not to get caught. Okay. I'm just
Christopher Hooper: so. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty it's pretty
Walden Briarhelm: learning about suggestion. New
Christopher Hooper: tricky. Um, and in fact, I think if it's borderline, we we could leave it up to a roll as
Luke Neverisky: Okie
Walden Briarhelm: guy. paste.
Luke Neverisky: do. Um, all right then. I will Yeah, I'll cast a suggestion on
Christopher Hooper: well. Hey, Corwin, stop eating my arm,
Luke Neverisky: Triple C here.
Christopher Hooper: okay? Get away from me, you sickle.
Luke Neverisky: Um, ew. Growth.
Christopher Hooper: He looks pretty
Ellis Taylor: Is he a
Luke Neverisky: Um, yeah. Um, can Triple C make a wisdom
Christopher Hooper: rough. Um,
Luke Neverisky: save of
Ellis Taylor: zombie?
Christopher Hooper: sure.
Walden Briarhelm: No fail. Fail.
Luke Neverisky: 16? Nice.
Christopher Hooper: Fails.
Luke Neverisky: Hey, TripleC, you you you know, you look like you could
Ellis Taylor: Take care tables
Luke Neverisky: um you could just really, you know, go with an uh
Ellis Taylor: and
Luke Neverisky: I you feel like you could use the chance to relax and party, but you know, you got to try to get over to that stage all sneakily and like so you give that a give that old college
Ellis Taylor: please
Christopher Hooper: Uh um
Luke Neverisky: try. I
Christopher Hooper: and he uh he started stumbling towards the
Luke Neverisky: don't know if you
Christopher Hooper: door. Uh
Luke Neverisky: I did it.
Christopher Hooper: and uh he opens up the door and he he stumbles out and
Luke Neverisky: Nice.
Christopher Hooper: um off he goes and uh you hear just behind him, "Oh god, I'm on
Luke Neverisky: Is it Is it working? Is he doing
Christopher Hooper: fire." Uh he opens the door and and you kind of see the battlefield in front of you. Um and uh let's see. Go ahead and give me I want everyone to give me a dexterity saving
Ellis Taylor: Oh

Ellis Taylor: Good
Christopher Hooper: right. Yes.
Ellis Taylor: question. What was our initial plan with the dragons? They were going to go

Tyram: or um I go over uh Brew

Christopher Hooper: Hang. Oh, yes. I have the dragon orb.
Walden Briarhelm: Did Did Brew know he had

Christopher Hooper: old other
Tyram: you. It doesn't say they have to be
Christopher Hooper: time. See, like you're doing right now. Oh,
Tyram: a friendly It doesn't say they have to be a friendly
Christopher Hooper: you did. Yeah, I believe you
Tyram: creature. Yeah. I'm just seeing if I it would
Christopher Hooper: have to reccast psychic phones who had
Tyram: actually work or not before I do that. Um, they can refuse it. They Well, I could speak, but then it says here, "A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time. No action required." So, Helisana could just hang up on
Christopher Hooper: um
Ali Leonard: I can also message
Tyram: me. That's true,
Ellis Taylor: Yeah, just be like, "Hey, we got a
Ali Leonard: her. Hey
Luke Neverisky: Hey,
Justin Hale: Hey
Tyram: too. All right. So, what how do we want to do if I got if I psychic phone? We could all talk. So maybe that is like silly
Ali Leonard: b****, we could try that first unless she hangs up and then I'll
Luke Neverisky: b****.
Tyram: idea. All right. Okay. I'll burn one of my uh psychic die to try
Ali Leonard: redial.
Ellis Taylor: gig." Yeah.
Tyram: to uh reup psychic whispers, including Helisana this time.
Christopher Hooper: Okay. And who are you leaving
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Justin Hale: boo. What the

Christopher Hooper: out?
Tyram: Uh actually, no. S doesn't feel guilty about that at all. Yeah. Leave it out.
Justin Hale: f***? f******
Tyram: All right. Okay. For the next uh two hours, we can all talk to each
Ellis Taylor: Brew.
Justin Hale: hell.
Tyram: other.
Justin Hale: I think as a montage throughout this whole thing, Brew is going to figure out he's been left out and he's just going to like mime being stabbed by Silus and falling on the
Tyram: Don't be so melodramatic. All right,
Justin Hale: ground.
Tyram: Helisana, who's the best manager in the world? I got you an

Christopher Hooper: Uh, it sounds like
Tyram: There is no f****** way Helisana would deny that
Christopher Hooper: a lot of
Tyram: she would ace an
Christopher Hooper: work. Yeah, I mean probably,
Ali Leonard: I think she's offended.
Christopher Hooper: but like Yeah,
Ali Leonard: She doesn't want She has to do an interview. I didn't say
Luke Neverisky: honestly.
Ali Leonard: that. I'm saying that as an explanation to
Tyram: interview. It's just a formality. All you got to do is show up and be like,

Luke Neverisky: Yeah, this should pave the way right for
Christopher Hooper: Whatever. I'm done with you.
Luke Neverisky: you.
Christopher Hooper: Okay. All right. All right, Silus. Uh, let me know if there's some other gangs while I try to sort this out. Uh, I'll see you guys later. And uh, she rides up and says, "This is f****** metal." Her voice harrowing as it echoes off the, uh,
Tyram: Um, as
Christopher Hooper: cavern walls.
Tyram: she leaves, is there any change in the behavior of the ravers?
Christopher Hooper: um a little they're they're dying down. The the party's over now. They um they uh
Luke Neverisky: Oh,
Christopher Hooper: have like eaten a bunch of corpses and stuff and now they're like um going back into Yeah. Now they're
Ali Leonard: upset. That
Christopher Hooper: like coming down and and kind of fading. They're all kind of like coming back to their
Ali Leonard: means
Christopher Hooper: senses and becoming more more normal like. Um and uh beginning to head back through into the tunnels. Um and what's left are a bunch of uh ironclaw bodies. Um it looks like the raers have uh killed the remaining golems uh that were still fighting. Um, but it's at
Luke Neverisky: Well,
Christopher Hooper: this point, uh, you hear continued explosions behind you. Uh, and at this point, Grim Jaw says, "Oh s***, it looks like the four turret's going to explode. I'm out of here, guys." Um, and yeah, why doesn't everyone give me a dexterity saving throw DC-15?
Tyram: Good. Yeah, I'm
Ellis Taylor: Oh, thank
Tyram: good.
Luke Neverisky: Oh
Ellis Taylor: goodness.
Justin Hale: Oh
Christopher Hooper: Everyone got
Luke Neverisky: man, not
Justin Hale: dear. I do have inspiration. Going to burn
Luke Neverisky: yet. I am going to burn a L point because I critically failed. Are you kidding me? I
Justin Hale: it. That's better. What was the
Tyram: Oh wow, that was statistically very
Christopher Hooper: it. Holy s***.
Justin Hale: save?
Christopher Hooper: Yeah,
Luke Neverisky: crice. What the balls? Can I do it
Christopher Hooper: sure. But it won't
Luke Neverisky: again?
Tyram: unlikely.
Luke Neverisky: Okay. I mean, can I consume multiple luck points for one
Tyram: Usually when you get a rroll thing, it explicitly
Christopher Hooper: count. Um I usually
Tyram: says you got to keep the roll, but I don't know. I don't know for certain, but that would be my
Christopher Hooper: not. Is it luck the feat or is there
Luke Neverisky: test?
Christopher Hooper: a what is it?
Luke Neverisky: Yes. Yeah, luck points. Yes, I think it's luxe. So, you can spend luck points to give yourself advantage. Oh, okay. So, that's just one extra roll
Christopher Hooper: Right.
Luke Neverisky: basically because obviously you don't have super advantage or anything. Okay, cool.
Tyram: guess.
Christopher Hooper: Exactly. Okay.
Luke Neverisky: that I still critically failed
Ellis Taylor: Oh
Christopher Hooper: Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Um All right. Yes.
Walden Briarhelm: Actually, I have a question. I has bless
Ellis Taylor: jeez. I don't think so. Let me go read up on it,
Walden Briarhelm: has bless expired at this
Ellis Taylor: but
Walden Briarhelm: point. It says it's up to one
Luke Neverisky: because oh I think
Ellis Taylor: Oh. Oh, yeah. And it gets gone.
Walden Briarhelm: minute. Okay, then never mind. Mine was uh What did I actually
Tyram: You have a 15 listed
Walden Briarhelm: roll? Yeah, but I So,
Tyram: here.
Walden Briarhelm: it's
Tyram: How did bless get you from 10 to
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Ellis Taylor: Wait, what? How? It's a
Walden Briarhelm: 10 is plus is the Oh, I Okay, so I
Tyram: 15? That was that was
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Walden Briarhelm: used a D8, so I was off anyways. And that's because I wrote
Tyram: baration not
Christopher Hooper: What? Yeah. Cool. So either
Ellis Taylor: D4. Yeah, that was the bird
Walden Briarhelm: juice. Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: way, um Okay. So if you
Ellis Taylor: juice. Well, did you have bar
Walden Briarhelm: Yep. I've updated my notes, but I did not make
Christopher Hooper: failed, he used it. Yeah.
Ellis Taylor: juice still? Because you could just use Oh,
Walden Briarhelm: it.
Tyram: less.
Christopher Hooper: Um, if you failed, you receive 15 fire damage as the forge heart um
Ellis Taylor: okay.
Christopher Hooper: explodes uh from an unstable
Walden Briarhelm: No. That's not
Christopher Hooper: uh
Walden Briarhelm: good.
Luke Neverisky: This place get out of
Ellis Taylor: All
Walden Briarhelm: Well, that's cool. I've taken volcano
Tyram: Yeah, let's book
Luke Neverisky: here.
Ellis Taylor: right. Do we still have that map? Let's Let's f****** go, guys.
Tyram: it.
Christopher Hooper: volcano. Uh yes, currently
Justin Hale: Sorry. What's the plan?
Christopher Hooper: brew
Justin Hale: I can't hear you guys in your
Tyram: We're talking out
Justin Hale: heads. Oh, are you now? I would not
Tyram: loud. Your ears still work. Of course, you
Luke Neverisky: We'll try to include you
Justin Hale: know.
Walden Briarhelm: damage.
Tyram: would
Justin Hale: It's hard to
Tyram: know. What are you
Justin Hale: tell me metaphysically when it's not real. What's
Tyram: talking about, Brew? We're in front of you talking, aren't we? Yeah, I told
Ali Leonard: I know I told Beville to
Justin Hale: happening?
Tyram: her that last time.
Ali Leonard: run with the rest of the hostages, but can I keep an eye out to make sure that
Walden Briarhelm: Hm.
Ali Leonard: they did get
Ellis Taylor: Oh yeah, 100%. George better not be
Christopher Hooper: Well, I think y'all should tell me if you
Ali Leonard: out?
Luke Neverisky: home. Okay.
Ellis Taylor: in
Tyram: We have I am running away
Christopher Hooper: are still standing at the door or where you're moving before I make you roll at
Tyram: from the
Christopher Hooper: DC. Okay. In what direction are you
Ali Leonard: We're running
Ellis Taylor: there. We're at I vote.
Christopher Hooper: running?
Ellis Taylor: We running for a blank wall and I'm hand making sure somebody Liliana has got the map and the brush and she's going to draw a straight line out
Tyram: door.
Christopher Hooper: Uh, cool. All right. Um, all
Ali Leonard: away.
Ellis Taylor: of here.
Christopher Hooper: right. So, now as you're running um out, you're all on the other side. Um, you're looking around. It looks like all the cages are empty at this point. Um, you don't
Ali Leonard: Except one.
Tyram: But we're glad
Christopher Hooper: see Oh, yes, except one. Um and even
Tyram: she's dead. Uh,
Christopher Hooper: that
Ellis Taylor: Wait, who are we leaving to
Tyram: Lady
Ali Leonard: Uhhuh. She's already
Luke Neverisky: Oh, is it?
Ellis Taylor: burn? Oh, she's dead. Okay.
Tyram: Corwin, we're leaving her corpse to burn.
Ali Leonard: dead. Yeah.
Ellis Taylor: Yeah, that's fine. That's
Ali Leonard: The
Ellis Taylor: fair. It's a dwarven way anyway,
Christopher Hooper: Um, cool.
Ali Leonard: dwarven
Luke Neverisky: Yeah, it's
Ellis Taylor: right?
Christopher Hooper: So, uh, Olivia takes the map out of Brew, uh,
Luke Neverisky: true.
Christopher Hooper: pocket and gives it to, uh, Liliana. And Liliana, um, I guess you know how this map works. And so y'all are
Justin Hale: Let's go.
Christopher Hooper: running towards a cavern wall to the side. Um, and it's interesting as you're looking at this
Ali Leonard: way.
Christopher Hooper: map, um, you
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: see, uh, walls moving on it like
Luke Neverisky: Heat.
Christopher Hooper: without you doing anything to it. Um, it looks like it's getting updated live.
Luke Neverisky: Oh, it's
Christopher Hooper: Uh, and
Luke Neverisky: pulling things live. That's
Christopher Hooper: you see this place is coming down real fast.
Luke Neverisky: great. Well, this is um this is not good, friends. We got to get out of here. Um yeah, it's hard. Yeah, bro. I appreciate
Ellis Taylor: Jesus, Brew, why did you do so
Luke Neverisky: enthusiasm, but
Ellis Taylor: much?
Christopher Hooper: Um, cool. Where are you? Uh, where are you? What are you
Luke Neverisky: um
Christopher Hooper: doing?
Luke Neverisky: um are the pieces of the map moving slow enough that I can actually like comprehend things or are they shifting so rapidly that it's
Christopher Hooper: Uh, you can make an
Luke Neverisky: like can't keep
Christopher Hooper: inside check if I get to do something
Ellis Taylor: Okay.
Luke Neverisky: up?
Justin Hale: You already rolled two ones. How
Christopher Hooper: bad. Okay,
Luke Neverisky: That's true. Yeah, f*** it. Let's Let's ride
Justin Hale: bad can it be? It was
Tyram: Oh, never ask if things can get
Christopher Hooper: cool.
Luke Neverisky: here. I got a 21
Justin Hale: last
Tyram: worse.
Christopher Hooper: Uh, okay. Everyone give me a DC uh 10
Luke Neverisky: on
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Tyram: Okay, I think I
Christopher Hooper: dexterity saving
Ali Leonard: He
Luke Neverisky: site. Oh, go
Ellis Taylor: Yeah. Oh, Lord have
Justin Hale: hard. He rolled. Well, why are you
Tyram: literally can't fail that. I nat 20ed very
Luke Neverisky: on. The DC was
Justin Hale: punishing
Luke Neverisky: 22.
Ellis Taylor: mercy. Nice.
Justin Hale: us? 19.
Tyram: uselessly.
Christopher Hooper: throw.
Ellis Taylor: 24.
Tyram: Yep. With Olivia's boost, I got a plus
Ali Leonard: is.
Ellis Taylor: Whoa.
Justin Hale: 31. Oh yeah, I guess I'm supposed to be adding that. Oh well, it doesn't
Tyram: 11.
Walden Briarhelm: We needed to be 15. You
Luke Neverisky: 10.
Walden Briarhelm: said 10. Oh, yeah. We beat
Christopher Hooper: No,
Ellis Taylor: I have a question. Does fire damage count as
Walden Briarhelm: that.
Tyram: No, your feed is for uh
Ellis Taylor: physical damage? No. Okay. I was just
Justin Hale: matter.
Tyram: bludgeoning, piercing, and
Ellis Taylor: curious. Okay.
Tyram: slashing.
Ellis Taylor: No, I was talking about my armor. It reduces physical damage by
Christopher Hooper: it's um Okay, cool. Uh did
Tyram: Um I believe so.
Christopher Hooper: everyone make it then? Cool.
Luke Neverisky: Yes.
Christopher Hooper: Um, so, uh, Liliana takes a moment to like look at this map before she starts painting. Um,
Ellis Taylor: three.
Christopher Hooper: and, uh, like just off to her right, like a huge boulder falls off the ground. Um, right where a group of you were and you're able to jump out of the way. Uh, she, um, what what were you trying to incite from the map?
Luke Neverisky: Basically, you'd said that the the pieces of the map are shifting and I want to make sure that I can actually ascertain the position that I'm in relative to things that are shifting and that is it um Facebook is not too chaotic in its
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Luke Neverisky: updates to really be able to tell where I am.
Christopher Hooper: So there's two there's two main sources of instability. One is the forchard itself was in which is in the center of the city and two is the top of the city. It looks like the top cavern ceiling has been destabilized probably from dragons uh and a giant dragon sized hole. Um and so those are the two forces that are uh causing the uh uh most of the like loadbearing structures to
Tyram: Can you fix that with the
Christopher Hooper: to start to cave
Luke Neverisky: Oh, interesting. I'll try.
Tyram: map?
Luke Neverisky: Um, so I'll draw an opening basically. Um, so the I'm having a tough
Christopher Hooper: in
Luke Neverisky: time visualizing the map here. So there's part up top that's um coming down and there's the forward chart that is unstable.
Ellis Taylor: Could you draw a series of weak points so it starts collapsing like to
Luke Neverisky: Okay. Oh, that's true. You do like when you fell a tree
Ellis Taylor: the side and not down on us?
Christopher Hooper: Mhm.
Luke Neverisky: basically, right? You want to like Okay. Yeah. So I'll
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Luke Neverisky: um I'll draw holes I guess on the if we're on the right side I'll draw on the left side or whatever right of the map to so that things cave on the opposite end of let's say the four chart is a center point or
Christopher Hooper: Um, okay, cool. Um, so while you're doing that, um, let's do another, uh, rockfall. Um, go ahead and give me a DC12
Luke Neverisky: something.
Christopher Hooper: dexterity saving throw.
Ellis Taylor: Oh, thank goodness.
Tyram: Man, I was like parkouring the s*** out of
Justin Hale: Hey, he's like
Tyram: this. What is taking you guys so long as I just like to do like
Christopher Hooper: Okay, cool. So, we have a failure from
Justin Hale: bored.
Christopher Hooper: Zach. Um, we have a pass from Taylor, pass from Justin, pass from uh Liliana, from Luke. Uh, what about Ellis? Then what about
Ellis Taylor: We put it in right
Christopher Hooper: alley? Oh, cool. Okay, cool. So
Ellis Taylor: before you put in the thing. We're right above it. Do you want us to wait? Do you want us to wait for that so you can have everyone below
Christopher Hooper: only uh yeah, that'd be nice. Um
Ellis Taylor: the little Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: okay, cool. Uh so yeah, uh rocks continue to fall on you as Liliana's um now like strategically painting a weak points throughout the mountain. Um, go ahead and give me um this is really a
Luke Neverisky: That's
Christopher Hooper: uh I mean
Luke Neverisky: right.
Ellis Taylor: Yes. I mean, you've been to lumberjack shows. That is a performance.
Christopher Hooper: uh it's it's really like an
Walden Briarhelm: Excuse
Tyram: Did
Christopher Hooper: intelligence-based uh like
Walden Briarhelm: me.
Tyram: one of our smart like what if if the intelligence just to see like how he should draw it? Could one of the smart people uh like coaches him on how to do
Christopher Hooper: Uh check here. yeah. Yeah. Uh we can
Ellis Taylor: We could be pointing over his shoulder and be like,
Christopher Hooper: uh we can have one person um pitch in here. Um that that helps
Tyram: it? All right, nerds. We need one of you to step up.
Luke Neverisky: That's not
Tyram: You and Ally,
Justin Hale: Who are you calling a
Tyram: obviously. Sorry. Brew and
Justin Hale: nerd? Who is

Christopher Hooper: Liliana.
Luke Neverisky: good.
Ali Leonard: Either one. I mean, I don't know what your
Ellis Taylor: "Yeah.
Justin Hale: Ally? All right.
Tyram: Obviously, mine's very
Ali Leonard: intelligence is. It's probably think it's No, not
Luke Neverisky: All
Ali Leonard: yours.
Ellis Taylor: Well, we also just lost an intelligence
Tyram: low. Yeah.
Ali Leonard: Bruce, did we lose a point
Ellis Taylor: point,
Justin Hale: I I'm like so smart.
Ali Leonard: or did it go from 19 to
Ellis Taylor: too. I f*** if I know. I was just waiting till it actually came up to Atoer. I'm not smart anyway.
Christopher Hooper: a point versus 19 to
Tyram: Did she lose the modifier go down by one or the score go down
Ali Leonard: 18? Like is it right now? It's a plus
Tyram: by
Christopher Hooper: 18. Oh, uh, the
Ali Leonard: four, right?
Luke Neverisky: right.
Christopher Hooper: score.
Ali Leonard: Okay. So, I'm still at plus4.
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. Cool. So, anyone want to give me
Tyram: one?
Christopher Hooper: um anyone want to step up here? Um,
Ali Leonard: Brew, do you wanna I'll just I'll just
Christopher Hooper: now um yeah.
Ali Leonard: go. Is it
Justin Hale: Rolling
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. Give me just a straight intelligence check here.
Justin Hale: intelligence. Oh, that's a now one for me.
Christopher Hooper: Well, okay. So, you're supposed to tell me
Justin Hale: So, you can do
Christopher Hooper: who's doing it first. So, if Brew, if you did
Ali Leonard: intelligence?
Justin Hale: it.
Tyram: You have the halfling thing. You get to reroll your ones.
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Got to take that
Justin Hale: Oh.
Ali Leonard: Oh, there you
Luke Neverisky: roll. Thank
Justin Hale: Oh, I do.
Christopher Hooper: it, another
Luke Neverisky: god.
Justin Hale: Ah. Click on the thing. I guess uh it's
Christopher Hooper: one.
Luke Neverisky: That's six
Justin Hale: a seven.
Christopher Hooper: That's six more. Um, all right. It is. It is taking
Tyram: Well, you can flash a genius yourself. Make it
Christopher Hooper: y'all a while. I'm gonna
Ali Leonard: go.
Christopher Hooper: need But does
Justin Hale: So I could which would make it four
Luke Neverisky: more.
Justin Hale: more. So
Tyram: better. Was she intelligence spawn? I thought
Christopher Hooper: he 15? Okay. All
Justin Hale: 15.
Tyram: it was five. Oh, a
Christopher Hooper: right. All
Justin Hale: Mhm. Uh
Tyram: sec.
Christopher Hooper: right. then it won't take quite as long and we'll only have a DC13 dexterity saving
Justin Hale: four. You guys, I'm like so
Christopher Hooper: throw. You're so
Luke Neverisky: Of course you
Christopher Hooper: smart. Oh, worst
Luke Neverisky: are.
Christopher Hooper: one
Justin Hale: smart.
Christopher Hooper: yet. Wow, y'all are rolling lights out. One more. One
Ellis Taylor: for a very dexterous
Christopher Hooper: more. Justin's like, I don't want to roll again. I've rolled too much. Y'all got mad at me last time I
Ellis Taylor: crew. We should really like form
Christopher Hooper: rolled.
Luke Neverisky: The house is real.
Ellis Taylor: a
Christopher Hooper: Incomprehensible. Okay, Justin, I'm going to roll for
Ali Leonard: Are
Luke Neverisky: Yeah. Be
Christopher Hooper: you. Okay, you made
Ali Leonard: you
Justin Hale: What? Did I miss
Christopher Hooper: it. Um, all right. Uh,
Justin Hale: something?
Walden Briarhelm: meal that.
Christopher Hooper: so this whole time there's just like rock falls, boulders falling all around you. Uh, you hear more explosions from behind you coming from the forart. Um,
Ellis Taylor: 6:30.
Christopher Hooper: and uh the
Luke Neverisky: poop.
Christopher Hooper: uh cavern continues to fall in, but uh Brew and Liliana are able to um strategically wink in parts of the mountain and uh it seems the cavern begins to stabilize a little bit. Um and you hear like before you would just constantly hear just like crashing the the huge just like gritty sound of of rock against rock. Um but it begins to get quieter as uh basically a rock slide on the back of the city has came and stabilized. Um and you are also able to see this on your on your map as it as it updates for you. Um all right, cool. Um, Liliana, technically I I your check is high enough that uh it auto succeeds, but if you want to give me a performance check, you can just uh, you know, flex on these
Luke Neverisky: Yes, I will flex on these
Christopher Hooper: hoes.
Luke Neverisky: friends. Actually, I got a 15.
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. You're like you you you get kind of
Luke Neverisky: So, it's not my
Christopher Hooper: bored because you're like waiting for Brew to figure it out and he like
Luke Neverisky: best.
Christopher Hooper: keeps like like getting sidetracked and stuff.
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: Um but it's all right. Yeah. Yeah. You're very
Ali Leonard: He forgot his glasses.
Luke Neverisky: Yeah, but I never showed it. Never
Christopher Hooper: polite. Um all right. So it it sounds
Luke Neverisky: show
Christopher Hooper: like uh it is stabilized a little bit. Um and it is finally grows quiet in the main hall here.
Ellis Taylor: Thank god my home isn't destroyed. We did all of that. I was so worried we were going to do all of that and it was just all going to crumble under the mountain.
Luke Neverisky: Um, I'm gonna um walk up to Silus and give him a little shove. Like, you scared us with stabbing brew. That was that was that was
Ellis Taylor: Yeah, Olivia's gonna walk up and grab his ear, like box his ear, be like, "Ever do that
Tyram: Look, I'm sorry. I'm
Ellis Taylor: again." And Bru, too, like at the same
Justin Hale: What? What did I even
Tyram: sorry. Ow. Jesus. Ow. Christ.
Luke Neverisky: deceitful.
Ellis Taylor: time. I appreciate
Justin Hale: do?
Ellis Taylor: it. It was very smart, but don't ever do that again. I think my heart almost
Tyram: Okay. Look, you guys are terrible liars. It never would have worked
Ellis Taylor: gave
Justin Hale: Is this how you treat
Tyram: if I had let you in on the
Ellis Taylor: out. I know, and I
Justin Hale: somebody that just got
Tyram: plan.
Ellis Taylor: agree. Did you guys explain the stabbing? Was it just like a theatric slight of hand or did you

Tyram: Um, okay. Look guys,
Luke Neverisky: she's still holding his
Tyram: real talk. I am sorry about that. Except for the part where I stab Brew. I honestly think we should start every plan with that moving forward. But lies only work
Luke Neverisky: ear.
Tyram: if you're selling something people are prone to believe, you know? And Helga knows me
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Tyram: from way back. And that that's who I've always been. I've always been the guy who cuts and runs, who sells people out for money. It was a pretty believable thing for her, but that might be who I've always been, but it's it's not who I want to be now.
Luke Neverisky: Well, good cuz I my my heart can't take
Ali Leonard: And you've traumatized
Luke Neverisky: that

Um, and you find this like a weird It's like a sending stone, but it's uh like mounted with this like little like digital brick. Nothing that Omo or Litui would be familiar with. Uh, and it seems like it is uh what we would know as like uh
Walden Briarhelm: No.
Christopher Hooper: a voice machine, a voicemail machine um that you can connect to like a landline um that you can like leave messages in
Justin Hale: from from the days of
Christopher Hooper: and answering machine. That's what it's

Christopher Hooper: with their brew buddy. Um, yeah. I mean, what do y'all What do y'all want to do? I mean, if you're not with this party, then you probably don't know what's happening because these
Ali Leonard: good.
Tyram: yet actually
Christopher Hooper: are like days and hours
Tyram: um Brew Well, when Brew and Silus are alone on top of the mountain actually like
Christopher Hooper: apart.
Tyram: um I I think we might have still had some of our stolen booze in the back of the Bugatti, right? Um, I want to take
Christopher Hooper: Oh yeah. Yep.
Tyram: some of that and uh I think Silus and Brew maybe like offer up a toast to our fallen comrades from our old gang who we, you know, managed to
Christopher Hooper: Mhm.
Tyram: avenge. Pour one out for
Justin Hale: those
Tyram: him.
Christopher Hooper: Um I think after
Luke Neverisky: Record
Christopher Hooper: several hours like you convince um Pepsi to
Luke Neverisky: this.
Christopher Hooper: to drink with you and you all just
Ali Leonard: It's a
Justin Hale: guys. So am I. Who
Tyram: Yeah. The baby dragon. Dragons like breastfeed on
Christopher Hooper: like he's probably older than you
Tyram: f****** magma, you know.
Christopher Hooper: are. Probably older than
Justin Hale: cares? That's also
Christopher Hooper: Brew.
Justin Hale: true.
Christopher Hooper: Um, and y'all have a have a moment to to think about
Ali Leonard: baby.
Christopher Hooper: all that's happened.
Justin Hale: It's one of those rare moments you see a tear come out
Christopher Hooper: Um, okay.
Justin Hale: of Bru's eye.
Tyram: S will actually like put his hand on Bruce's shoulder like you know they do a toast
Christopher Hooper: Uh, continues to just like
Tyram: Pepsi, we're here. You don't need to be upset
Christopher Hooper: weep.
Luke Neverisky: I've seen such a
Ali Leonard: Oh
Justin Hale: It's so simple.
Ali Leonard: my god.
Walden Briarhelm: Do you offer Pepsi some
Tyram: anymore. Yeah, totally. Sure. Hell
Christopher Hooper: Oh yeah, Jack and Pepsi. There you
Luke Neverisky: soft
Walden Briarhelm: whiskey? Oh,
Christopher Hooper: go. Um,
Walden Briarhelm: there you
Tyram: yeah.
Christopher Hooper: okay. I think that brings us close to uh the end of Ark 2 and the
Walden Briarhelm: go.
Christopher Hooper: epilogue. And uh I wrote an epilogue that has changed a
Justin Hale: Oh, wait. One more thing. Pepsi, I'll totally make
Christopher Hooper: lot.
Luke Neverisky: Wait, you going it?
Justin Hale: a cool mount for you to stand on top of the Bugatti so you can you can
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Justin Hale: go at super fast speeds while we drive.
Christopher Hooper: And this is the the first smile you've got from Pepsi since that time you gave him a freezer full of frozen
Justin Hale: Hell yes.
Tyram: tearing down those walls,
Justin Hale: It's working. It's
Christopher Hooper: fish. Um so uh over
Tyram: man.
Christopher Hooper: the next months, weeks um you are able to reestablish order in I
Justin Hale: working.
Christopher Hooper: forge led by a um highly vigilant uh chalk rock and a um highly authoritarian um but softening uh grim jaw. They uh rebuild and uh homes and uh work with you uh often to um restructure the new order in High Forge. Originally, hundreds of civilians had made a rapid but orderly march out of the front doors of High Forge led by Chalk Rock and had initially set up camps um all the way throughout the countryside leading up the road. Um but as uh order and and a lot of the chaos left High Forge um at least the upper parts uh the um many folks came back but a lot of people never returned. They decided to continue their new life wherever their tired feet took them and many didn't make it far. that uh cavern circle that turned training village uh turned into a bustling small town nearly overnight. Uh they they adopted a new name, the uh red brook. Uh many say the red is for the blood spilled uh in the city. Some say the red is for the dragon flames and some is the red for the heroes lost. And but optimists say the red is for the new dawn of the new day. Now, what happened to Lady Corwin, the less said is better, but uh about a month later, her mercenary army showed up and they marched right through the highforgates and not many people were willing to give them much of a fight uh cuz there wasn't much to uh fight over. Uh but they marched in and they did a investigation and they marched back out. You hear down the line that the official report from a name you'd heard before, Captain Sir Eric, was that the city was sacked and nothing worth saving. However, the soldiers had gone deep into the cities, many parts of the city that were blocked off by rockfalls, uh, boulders, and from those came many go stories. uh stories of a witch that rides a black dragon in the boughels of the city and horrific heavy metal ringing through the halls. And by the time uh the our our heroes managed to get everything together and kind of build a little bubble between uh at the at the High Forge gates with their roomfall. And eventually the F-150 was used as a uh government vehicle um that the our Taco Cat used occasionally but was mostly used by uh uh Chalk Rock to ride around the city um doing various chores and work. Um, uh, Brew eventually gets his, uh, recording machine, um, and, uh, uh, gets all his messages from Victor and, uh, one of the one of the during the next few weeks, Elizabeth, Brew, and Scarlet make a lot of progress on the Stellaro. It seems to be about half finished at this point. Um, and now I wonder uh what happens over the next month that each of you
Justin Hale: Well, we have a lot of projects to work
Christopher Hooper: do.
Justin Hale: on. Need to
Christopher Hooper: Mhm. Y'all want to
Justin Hale: work on the
Christopher Hooper: go uh one by one? We'll start with Justin.
Justin Hale: um I'd like to tie up the loose end of the pocket village that we've been working
Christopher Hooper: Oh, Pocket Village. Sorry. Pocket Village on Stellar
Justin Hale: on. Oh. Oh, okay. Um yeah. Well, that was Yeah, that was my loose end. I wanted to tie up.
Christopher Hooper: Radium. Um, so you get about half finished with that um based on the roles we had uh during Ark 2. Um, so decent progress. Uh, but there's a lot more to do. Um if that's a thread uh you want to follow, we can we can follow that in the next couple
Justin Hale: Uh, the only other thing personally that Brew would be working on is his uh, relationship with Pepsi. How to Train Your Dragon
Christopher Hooper: sessions. Okay, cool.
Justin Hale: style.
Christopher Hooper: Um, yeah. So, you um it takes a very long time. Um, but you eventually get Pepsi to like a kind of like a a ranging dog, like a a dog that kind of like goes out, but when they're hungry and tired, they'll come back um and be friendly towards you. Um, but very much like not really taking specific orders, but they're like, you know, uh, companionable at
Justin Hale: It sounds
Tyram: I think we're going for them to be our
Christopher Hooper: least.
Ellis Taylor: It's a
Tyram: friend, not like, you know, a mountain battle or something like that, you know?
Walden Briarhelm: Not
Tyram: I don't want to push our luck. So,
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. All right.
Luke Neverisky: What is
Ellis Taylor: I
Tyram: I'm
Christopher Hooper: And
Luke Neverisky: it?
Ellis Taylor: mean, hella gets to ride a dragon. Like, come
Justin Hale: like
Tyram: Elisana's a boss now, not a party
Ellis Taylor: on. This is
Walden Briarhelm: yet.
Christopher Hooper: You too can uh do cool stuff if you go
Justin Hale: Push the
Tyram: member. What a terrible
Christopher Hooper: evil and become an
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Ellis Taylor: true. Are you tempting
Walden Briarhelm: Awesome.
Justin Hale: control of your
Tyram: moral
Christopher Hooper: NPC.
Ellis Taylor: us?
Justin Hale: over.
Christopher Hooper: One easy step. Um cool. Anyone want to go next?
Walden Briarhelm: I I I uh I think that would spend time working with Litu to figure out as much as they can about where the moon goddess fell. And I wanted to ask the moon goddess fell near like the nearest
Christopher Hooper: That's
Walden Briarhelm: place that is land is Greyport. Is that
Christopher Hooper: right. Yeah. Yep.
Walden Briarhelm: correct? Okay. So, uh, planning to make sure that as soon as we make it to Graveport, we can have, uh, as many plans in place to, uh,
Tyram: Yeah. When Victor and like re like dealing with

Luke Neverisky: That's a full day right
Ellis Taylor: done. And argued with teenagers.
Tyram: I would try to get in contact with anyone
Ellis Taylor: Cool. I'm exhausted.
Tyram: left over from like the Twilight Company and try to
Luke Neverisky: there.
Tyram: like get them to help like move in supplies to help people, you know, like they have like a they have like this big network of like, you know, information sharing and like moving items and things like that. So, I try to lean on them to help get s*** for the the sprouting communities here.
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Justin Hale: like a a new Twilight Company. Twilight Company 2.0 Dawn Brothers. I don't
Tyram: Maybe. I mean, I don't think anything happened to the Twilight Company.
Justin Hale: know. Oh.
Tyram: It's not just based off of this
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Justin Hale: Oh, fair.
Christopher Hooper: Um, are there any loose ends? I know you talked about the orb um and going to
Tyram: city. Yeah. I guess
Christopher Hooper: Graport for the orb ritual. Sorry.
Tyram: if there's any way for me to research that from here, I'd try to do that if I could. Oh,
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Tyram: and I would also try to like uh if we're being here for like a month or
Christopher Hooper: Um,
Tyram: something, I might try to like go hang out with like Naomi and uh Julius for a weekend or two at
Ellis Taylor: Oh yeah, we need to know how um
Tyram: least.
Luke Neverisky: Oh
Ellis Taylor: Helisana's interview went because apparently she's just rocking it in the

Christopher Hooper: so
Luke Neverisky: yeah. Uh-huh.
Ellis Taylor: catacombs.
Tyram: around about uh Helisana while also you know
Christopher Hooper: Naomi was in
Tyram: visiting. Yes. So if I have
Christopher Hooper: another dimension, wasn't
Tyram: like how long would it take me to get back to that portal in like Red's
Christopher Hooper: she? Um,
Tyram: hometown? Now keep in mind we have a kick-ass Bugatti and or a Ford F-150.
Christopher Hooper: all
Tyram: whichever one is more suited for
Christopher Hooper: right.
Ali Leonard: Apparently, we don't have a Ford
Tyram: this. It he said we can still use it. It's a company
Ali Leonard: F-150. Mhm.
Ellis Taylor: We dropped We dropped Silus off. Drove him up there and dropped him
Ali Leonard: Cockro has it. He's already crashed into the freaking
Christopher Hooper: Um, y'all should just kill him and take his truck.
Luke Neverisky: Here we
Ellis Taylor: off.
Ali Leonard: lava. He's going to be the big bad. And I'm already saying
Tyram: car. I hope not because he
Ellis Taylor: No,
Ali Leonard: this. I'm predicting this. He actually is the m the bad
Walden Briarhelm: Jesus. Nice.
Tyram: has the if he has the Ford F-150, we're f*****. There's no way we
Ali Leonard: moon goddess.
Tyram: can up to that.
Christopher Hooper: Um um
Ali Leonard: I'm just saying. Guys, all doubt
Christopher Hooper: so uh these these threads uh will
Luke Neverisky: go.
Ellis Taylor: no.
Ali Leonard: me.
Christopher Hooper: be um we're going to have a um intermission where we tie up lucents uh before moving into arc 3. So these threads that we're we're talking about now um I will wrap up into um sessions uh including trying to visit Naomi. Um and during this time I will also make calls for GMs uh to run some of these sessions. Um, so, uh, yeah, I can
Ellis Taylor: Okay.
Christopher Hooper: I I will send the list, uh, when we're done and and they can provide inspiration.
Walden Briarhelm: We're guest GMing intermission

Walden Briarhelm: sessions.
Christopher Hooper: Um, all right,
Luke Neverisky: Nobody.
Ellis Taylor: take over the Naomi one. Yeah, she's
Christopher Hooper: cool.
Ellis Taylor: she's already mine already, so
Walden Briarhelm: Awesome. 50 Shades of Olivia Cooper.
Christopher Hooper: Um, knowing that, uh, do you want Olivia,
Luke Neverisky: What's
Christopher Hooper: uh, to run any loose ends that that you have in mind,
Ellis Taylor: I don't know. I feel like she's fully immersed in rebuilding
Christopher Hooper: Ellis?
Ellis Taylor: the city. I can't really think of anything. I mean, George is fine.
Luke Neverisky: this?
Ellis Taylor: My apartment, but that's I don't know. That's a conversation, not
Christopher Hooper: Okay. Maybe
Ellis Taylor: a session. So, Oh, Lord. Not that woman again.
Christopher Hooper: Um, she's probably dead. Okay, cool. Uh, anyone else want to go?
Luke Neverisky: Um, I'm trying to think like would definitely want to try to spend some time like Olivia giving back to the community and helping, you know, uh, rebuild
Christopher Hooper: Okay, we'll assume that everyone helps like rebuild H High Forge in some
Luke Neverisky: things. Okay. Okay. Um, I don't know that we ever established where Liliana is from geographically. Um, but I can
Christopher Hooper: way.
Luke Neverisky: say that she would probably want to reunite with her family if they're still around. Um, given that she was being a passenger in Helisana um, for a
Christopher Hooper: Okay. Uh-huh.
Luke Neverisky: while. Um, she'll also want to I think um I think she'll also want to try to um
Christopher Hooper: Uh-huh.
Luke Neverisky: uh pick up the life of being a performer again, but with the goal of um pure entertainment and teaching others um the art of music and not necessarily for fame and glory. Um, so maybe holding together holding like some I don't know benefit events or something um to raise funds for the city. Um maybe like teaching some classes or something.
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Luke Neverisky: Um how to whatever play mandolin or
Ellis Taylor: helping kids
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Luke Neverisky: something. There you go. Exactly.
Ellis Taylor: express their emotions through music, their trauma.
Christopher Hooper: I think uh I
Luke Neverisky: Yep.
Walden Briarhelm: Beautiful.
Christopher Hooper: think Liliana spends a lot of time with like former Ironclaws like helping them
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: rehabilitate. Uh
Luke Neverisky: rehabilitation. Yeah, that's
Ellis Taylor: Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: cool cool. All right. Anything else,
Luke Neverisky: perfect. I think that's
Christopher Hooper: Luke? Yeah. Cool. Uh,
Ali Leonard: I think she just has like a couple things like she is obviously working
Luke Neverisky: it.
Ali Leonard: on the thing with Brew sometimes with the lady scientist and then she'll reach out to
Christopher Hooper: Elizabeth. You came up with this
Ali Leonard: Rebel
Christopher Hooper: name.
Ali Leonard: Rebel. Yeah, I reach out to her and make sure that she's okay. I'm sure she's still in the city, but then I just like make sure that she's okay. She was kidnapped and then put in a cage and then stabbed. Um, so
Christopher Hooper: Mhm.
Ellis Taylor: Yeah. Yeah.
Ali Leonard: that is a lot. Um, and then I want her working on the roomfall,
Christopher Hooper: Yeah.
Ali Leonard: but also trying to reach her freaking god. I would love to kind of reach Tony, maybe kind of get
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Ali Leonard: in
Tyram: What the
Christopher Hooper: Okay. So,
Ali Leonard: contact like a lot of like night drives. Yeah, it's a lot. You have to like kind of commune
Walden Briarhelm: Is that how you do it is through night
Ali Leonard: I think with the machine.
Walden Briarhelm: drives? I love this so
Ali Leonard: So, a little bit of Baby Driver, put on that
Tyram: f***?
Christopher Hooper: yeah.
Ali Leonard: radio. But so like as she's
Walden Briarhelm: much.
Ali Leonard: going out, she's also like seeing the the villages that have been made. I think she's kind of like scoping out like also now how different it is and like see kind of mapping it out and also like telling everybody about High Forge and stuff like you know like kind of establishing
Walden Briarhelm: Nice. I'm
Christopher Hooper: Uh-huh. All
Ali Leonard: contacts on the
Walden Briarhelm: moaning. I have a
Christopher Hooper: right.
Ali Leonard: way.
Walden Briarhelm: question. In general, will there sort of like Need for
Ellis Taylor: Mhm.
Walden Briarhelm: Speed games? Will Greyport have its own racing scene with its own maybe even
Christopher Hooper: Mhm.
Walden Briarhelm: new group of
Christopher Hooper: Um, it did before. Um, if that's something else
Walden Briarhelm: racists?
Christopher Hooper: with wants to develop, it could
Walden Briarhelm: Awesome. Just
Christopher Hooper: be. Oh, did you say
Ali Leonard: Greatort or High
Walden Briarhelm: curious.
Christopher Hooper: Greyport or High Forge? Sorry. Oh,
Ali Leonard: Forge. I thought he
Christopher Hooper: yes. Uh, yes. Greatort has its own racing
Ali Leonard: said, "Yeah, I wasn't going to focus on the racising scene and
Walden Briarhelm: Grayport.
Ali Leonard: I kind of off the jump. So, I figured that wasn't like
Tyram: and we got downtime. I mean, it seems like this is a great time to do
Ellis Taylor: Oh yeah. Yes. They're not going to be a Wrestlemania entertain
Ali Leonard: priority. I put out some feelers. I just
Walden Briarhelm: Excellent.
Tyram: it.
Christopher Hooper: scene. I don't want to speak for Elizabeth,
Ellis Taylor: everybody.
Ali Leonard: like
Christopher Hooper: but I kind of assumed that she would teach Chalk Rock how to drive.
Ellis Taylor: Would you teach
Ali Leonard: I would
Tyram: Why on earth would anyone do
Christopher Hooper: Okay,
Ellis Taylor: the teenagers how to drive? Give them some advanced
Ali Leonard: not I would teach the
Christopher Hooper: fine. You teach the teens but not the like
Ellis Taylor: driving.
Ali Leonard: teens. I would host
Tyram: that? The less Chalk Croc knows how to
Christopher Hooper: mayor of the city. Okay,
Ali Leonard: Absolutely.
Tyram: drive, the more we get to drive the
Christopher Hooper: cool.
Tyram: F-150.
Ali Leonard: Absolutely. Stop. I don't like to
Walden Briarhelm: Oh.
Ali Leonard: do anything good for the person that's going to kill my grandmother. You know what I mean? I
Walden Briarhelm: Oh, it's sensible enough.
Tyram: There are there's lots of good reasons not to do s*** for
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Ali Leonard: don't know. I'm weird about
Tyram: chalk
Christopher Hooper: Okay. All right. I'm I'm perplexed
Ali Leonard: that. I
Christopher Hooper: uh by the
Ali Leonard: am respecting him by not raiding his apartment to see how
Tyram: rock.
Ali Leonard: much stuff he has of my grandmother's, which I'm pretty sure he's in her
Walden Briarhelm: I
Christopher Hooper: party's jokes on you. He doesn't have an
Ali Leonard: apartment. He's living in her
Tyram: I'm genuinely
Christopher Hooper: apartment.
Ali Leonard: walls. Yeah, that's what I
Tyram: baffled as to why you think we would do favors for chalk
Ellis Taylor: I
Ali Leonard: thought.
Christopher Hooper: Um you put him in the position of power. You made him run
Ellis Taylor: like chalk
Ali Leonard: Olivia is the only person that likes shock rock. Olivia put him in
Christopher Hooper: this city.
Ellis Taylor: rock. He's very He's very competent. He's
Ali Leonard: this
Tyram: rock.
Ellis Taylor: just very awkward. Maybe it's colored by the AI notes I
Ali Leonard: position.
Christopher Hooper: That was pretty
Ellis Taylor: read because I think it specifically said that
Ali Leonard: Every time there's a new ding in the Ford F-150, I bring Olivia down there and I circle it and I point it out like Chalk Rock did
Christopher Hooper: accurate.
Ellis Taylor: Yeah, I know. I know.
Walden Briarhelm: This is on
Christopher Hooper: Um
Ellis Taylor: He just needs a little He needs some friends. Honestly, he really just needs friends. He's a
Ali Leonard: this. Well, if he didn't make dolls of them, I think he would be
Ellis Taylor: little He needs real
Ali Leonard: fine. You talk to
Walden Briarhelm: him.
Christopher Hooper: Uh,
Ellis Taylor: interactions. He does now. He's getting
Christopher Hooper: cool. So, over the
Ellis Taylor: better.
Walden Briarhelm: It's getting
Christopher Hooper: next few weeks, uh, you'll do these things. Um, so, uh, congrats. End of Ark 2. Everyone, level up
Justin Hale: Oh
Tyram: Oh
Christopher Hooper: to level 9ine. Um, and if you didn't end up arguing with teens, you would have noticed a
Luke Neverisky: s***.
Ali Leonard: people.
Christopher Hooper: bunch of magical items at the back of the truck which they eventually hand out
Walden Briarhelm: better.
Christopher Hooper: as they as uh things calm
Ellis Taylor: Whoa.
Tyram: s***. Did they hand them out to
Christopher Hooper: down. I don't know. Maybe eventually they probably get to it. Um, I still need stuff
Tyram: us?
Christopher Hooper: from um from Ellis and
Justin Hale: s***. I added mine.
Christopher Hooper: Justin. Did
Ellis Taylor: Yes, I need to do
Justin Hale: Yeah, I added um I added I added a thing. What was it? Nope.
Christopher Hooper: you Diablo
Justin Hale: That does sound on brand for me though.
Tyram: I guess there is a good question hanging
Christopher Hooper: sauce?
Walden Briarhelm: There's a
Tyram: in the air though. Would Brew and
Walden Briarhelm: tool.
Tyram: Silus tell the rest of the party that we found 26,000
Justin Hale: Um yeah, that's a great question. Maybe it just stays in the
Tyram: gold?
Christopher Hooper: at
Justin Hale: Bugatti since no one else wants to be around
Tyram: Actually, no. Silus is growing as a person. He'd probably tell the rest of the
Justin Hale: it. It's not like we wouldn't use it on the rest of the party. It's just the Bugatti is the the 26,000 gold
Tyram: party.
Justin Hale: bank. What better place
Tyram: You do make an excellent
Justin Hale: for it to be safe than inside the Bugatti?
Tyram: point.
Christopher Hooper: home.
Walden Briarhelm: the mobile
Justin Hale: Um, so I added the cloak of displacement and the bag of
Christopher Hooper: Oh,
Justin Hale: devouring. Bag of dev devouring because you know chaos goblin and it sounds fun.
Tyram: I was about to say you are sinking
Justin Hale: Oh,
Tyram: Toeer's generosity into a not particularly useful magic
Justin Hale: the bag of
Tyram: item. It's it's it's
Walden Briarhelm: bank.
Justin Hale: devouring. You can throw people in it.
Tyram: niche, man.
Christopher Hooper: okay.
Luke Neverisky: Okay.
Walden Briarhelm: Have
Tyram: If you're in a position to throw people in the back of devouring, you basically
Walden Briarhelm: you I'm
Tyram: have already
Luke Neverisky: Yeah.
Justin Hale: All right, let me let me think on the bag.
Christopher Hooper: Um, Elizabeth, you do you find a a magical wrench. Um, and it's called Anony's
Ali Leonard: I found
Walden Briarhelm: Sweet.
Tyram: won.
Walden Briarhelm: Is it like big like it could be wielded as a
Christopher Hooper: wrench. Um, no.
Walden Briarhelm: weapon too? No, it's
Christopher Hooper: Nope. It's like a
Walden Briarhelm: just like a multi-tool.
Christopher Hooper: multi-tool. Um, you find Belt
Ali Leonard: brand.
Christopher Hooper: of Bear, the Strongest Man of Silbury.
Walden Briarhelm: Cool.
Christopher Hooper: Um, is that right?
Luke Neverisky: Dang.
Christopher Hooper: Okay.
Walden Briarhelm: Okay. Um
Christopher Hooper: Um, Silas, you find uh the Cape of
Ali Leonard: Who the heck is
Christopher Hooper: Marcus and Liliana, you find the mandolin of rude truths.
Justin Hale: Uh, I don't think that's the cape you wanted. Was it, Taylor? I think that's the
Ali Leonard: Marcus?
Justin Hale: cape I
Tyram: Uh here. Let me take
Christopher Hooper: I think
Tyram: a
Christopher Hooper: he the cape of displacement. I think two people,
Tyram: look. That one wasn't one of
Christopher Hooper: three people wanted it. Uh well
Justin Hale: wanted. That was
Tyram: mine.
Christopher Hooper: then never mind. Do you want to do you want to
Justin Hale: one that I wanted. Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: brew? All right, then I'll give you that one. Cape of
Justin Hale: Okay.
Christopher Hooper: Marcus. And uh I'll get I'll get one of Silus's other
Tyram: Okay.
Christopher Hooper: ones. I was choosing between two. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. What was your other cape that you were looking at,
Tyram: Um, it was the uh cloak of like Arachna,
Christopher Hooper: Silus?
Justin Hale: Correct.
Tyram: whatever. The other one was like just a clo of
Christopher Hooper: Yeah. And then what was the other
Walden Briarhelm: It's
Tyram: protection.
Christopher Hooper: one? Oh, and it's green. Okay. in
Ellis Taylor: Where did you want us to put
Walden Briarhelm: gone.
Christopher Hooper: the party inventory. Uh you can either put it you need to put
Ellis Taylor: these?
Christopher Hooper: one item in tells lies and you want to put one in tells
Ellis Taylor: Oh, I don't know what any of that means. How
Tyram: If you go to
Christopher Hooper: truth.
Ellis Taylor: on earth do you get to the party
Ali Leonard: in D and D
Tyram: your character and click on inventory, there's a tab that says
Ellis Taylor: inventory? Okay, hold
Ali Leonard: beyond when you go to your inventory
Tyram: party
Ellis Taylor: on.
Christopher Hooper: Uh
Ellis Taylor: My characters need to navigate
Christopher Hooper: All right. And Silus, you find a cloak of
Ali Leonard: screen.
Tyram: inventory. Oh s***. Does it have a funky name?
Christopher Hooper: Arachna. No, it already
Tyram: Okay, that is
Christopher Hooper: it already has a funky
Ellis Taylor: there. So, what's the difference between tells
Tyram: true. Don't get me
Christopher Hooper: name. Oh my
Ellis Taylor: lies and tells truth? All
Christopher Hooper: god. This is why This is why we can't talk about anything until everyone's everyone's
Luke Neverisky: Sorry.
Tyram: started. Oh, well, sick.
Ellis Taylor: right. Can I just tell you what I wanted
Walden Briarhelm: I
Christopher Hooper: here. Uh,
Ellis Taylor: to put in there and you tell me where it should go?
Christopher Hooper: sure.
Ellis Taylor: I wanted to do the some winged
Christopher Hooper: Okay. Someone else already put that, so we can we can mark that as
Ellis Taylor: boots. Okay.
Christopher Hooper: yours. Okay.
Ellis Taylor: And then I was thinking about the
Walden Briarhelm: don't
Christopher Hooper: Amul devotion.
Ellis Taylor: amu amulet of
Christopher Hooper: Okay. Okay. Of the
Ellis Taylor: devotion of the devout. Oh yeah,
Luke Neverisky: Okay.
Walden Briarhelm: H.
Ellis Taylor: sorry. Shield of expression. That looks cool too. SLSient Shield
Christopher Hooper: devout.
Tyram: Der, how do you feel about
Walden Briarhelm: H.
Tyram: um role playinging a magic
Christopher Hooper: I we're gonna find
Ellis Taylor: How
Tyram: item?
Christopher Hooper: out. Um I already added them,
Ellis Taylor: many should we put in? Just
Christopher Hooper: but
Ellis Taylor: two. Okay. So, I just found the shield of
Christopher Hooper: yes. Oh, shield of
Ellis Taylor: expression. That looks cool, too. But it's okay.
Christopher Hooper: expression. Okay. Shield of expression. Shield of
Ellis Taylor: Yeah. It's also It says
Walden Briarhelm: Awesome.
Ellis Taylor: slash sentient shield. I just did like list of it's the AI overview of magic items for
Christopher Hooper: expression. Okay. the the one I found is a common item. So, I'm going to
Ellis Taylor: Paladin. Oh, I actually look at
Christopher Hooper: say I'm going to give you not that. Then I'm gonna um Yeah. So,
Ellis Taylor: it. Yeah.
Christopher Hooper: uh you can uh you find the amulet of devout plus two. Um, and it should be in the tells lies bag and you can just move that directly into your your um your inventory and that's where I updated all these. Okay, great. I don't know why I've done this to myself, but that'll be
Tyram: Thank
Christopher Hooper: okay.
Luke Neverisky: He's a generous
Ellis Taylor: Okay.
Tyram: you.
Christopher Hooper: Um yeah, and over the coming months you find that uh most of these seem to have a little personality to him and um hopefully I keep track of
Luke Neverisky: DM.
Christopher Hooper: that. Um I think especially uh Olivia, your amulet out um says uh when you when you pick it up one morning as you're getting up to your coffee, it just says, "Yeah, you're really not a great follower at Tier, are you?" Um, and then it doesn't say anything to you. It doesn't respond to you for like days and it says, "I bet you can't lift 200
Ellis Taylor: like, "f*** you. That's my warm up." And she put
Christopher Hooper: lb." And then you don't hear for for another week or
Ellis Taylor: the
Christopher Hooper: so. Um, and just little little stuff like that. Um, cool. And that's it for tonight. Um, so, uh, I I can post this in the discord, but I have two, uh, two types of prompts if anyone wants to do some some sessions and I will too in in sort of this intermediate period before we go into arc 2, which is um, you can take uh, from this list uh, that we just put together of um different things that uh y'all are interested in in running. Um, or you can run a backstory, uh, a quest like from your backstory and basically, uh, just run it with everyone basically running like mirror image characters that they would be in that scenario. And so everyone gets to keep their stat sheet and stuff like that um, and run from there. So, like, uh, something that I'm curious about is like, um, and I think would be super fun is the heist that, uh, Brew and Silus got f***** up on. Um, I think would make for such an
Justin Hale: There we
Christopher Hooper: awesome oneshot. Um, so that's one that I'm like, that's a cool oneshot. I I would love to play it. Um, but it'd be great to
Justin Hale: go.
Christopher Hooper: to be told from like the the lens of either Silus or Brew
Tyram: Yeah. That was something to think
Christopher Hooper: or something like
Luke Neverisky: makes
Christopher Hooper: that. Cool. And then um it'll kind of be it'll kind of be like the the interlude between Ark 1 and two, but I'll still be here the whole time. It'll also be during the holidays, so I kind of feel like it's a
Luke Neverisky: sense.
Christopher Hooper: little people are going to be busy over the next few months. Um, and then we'll kick off Ark 3. Uh,
Tyram: about.
Christopher Hooper: probably going to Greyport. Uh, yeah, actually definitely going to Greport and doing a bunch of stuff there. Um, uh, just kick off Ark
Walden Briarhelm: We're
Tyram: Are we playing on Halloween next
Christopher Hooper: 3.
Luke Neverisky: very
Christopher Hooper: Oo,
Ellis Taylor: No, we will be
Walden Briarhelm: excited.
Tyram: week? You know, I hear it's super dangerous to go trick-or-treating on Halloween night. Um, you know, they're passing out those Snickers with razor
Luke Neverisky: cool.
Ellis Taylor: trick-or-treating.
Justin Hale: Mhm. I've heard they got Tylenol in them
Tyram: blades and s*** like that. Yeah, you should definitely do like a like a
Justin Hale: now.
Tyram: trunk or treat thing on like the weekend or something instead. It's just
Justin Hale: Yeah, we
