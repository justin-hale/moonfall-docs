**Christopher Hooper:** me.

**Luke Neverisky:** fists. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** You sure about that?

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah. Uh, let me just see. Is Sunn strike? That's after I connect. If I connect, right? Okay, cool. Never played a monk before, so this

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, that's

**Luke Neverisky:** is interesting. Um, all

**Justin Hale:** Can't say that anymore.

**Luke Neverisky:** right. That's true. First attack is a miss with a 15 to

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Luke Neverisky:** hit presumably. Uh, what about a 22,

**Christopher Hooper:** That misses. That

**Luke Neverisky:** though? All right. All

**Justin Hale:** Bring it better or we're in

**Christopher Hooper:** hits

**Luke Neverisky:** right. Oh my god. Roll the one. Uh, so he's going to take six damage. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And she when you

**Luke Neverisky:** then

**Christopher Hooper:** connect, she spits in your

**Luke Neverisky:** Rude just

**Justin Hale:** trouble.

**Christopher Hooper:** face.

**Tyram:** Hey, I didn't realize I was muted. Um, he should be rolling with advantage,

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, he should be. You're right. Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yes. So, that first

**Tyram:** right?

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** one hit then. All right. Uh, he still

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** spits in your face. Make a dexterity saving throw. Uh which

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. I got a nine.

**Christopher Hooper:** you have disadvantage

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, no.

**Christopher Hooper:** on. Uh that

**Tyram:** Yeah. Are you close enough for Olivia's

**Luke Neverisky:** 10. I'm within 10. Okay. So, 13.

**Tyram:** horror?

**Luke Neverisky:** Is it plus three?

**Christopher Hooper:** fails. That still fails.

**Justin Hale:** I like a high

**Christopher Hooper:** Um you're blinded and you take uh six

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. And I'm relying on you for health

**Christopher Hooper:** acid damage.

**Luke Neverisky:** decrement. Okay. Um can I also pop a focus

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. Sounds good.

**Luke Neverisky:** point and do um on that attack that connected at least

**Tyram:** Damn.

**Luke Neverisky:** um the stunning strike which I'm trying to find

**Justin Hale:** 15.

**Luke Neverisky:** is a DC13 con I'm

**Justin Hale:** Thank you

**Tyram:** What?

**Luke Neverisky:** assuming. Yeah. DC3 con.

**Tyram:** It is a con save.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. All

**Luke Neverisky:** cities. All

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Makes

**Luke Neverisky:** right. Um, let's see. On the successful save the target speed is have

**Justin Hale:** everyone.

**Christopher Hooper:** it

**Luke Neverisky:** until Okay, so they at least have half speed. I'll wait. On a successful save, the target speed is half until next turn and the next attacker made against it has advantage. That's bananas,

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah, stunning

**Luke Neverisky:** dude. I didn't realize I had a a

**Tyram:** strike is bonkers

**Luke Neverisky:** can't lose condition.

**Justin Hale:** What the

**Tyram:** now. I mean, it's always like stunning is way

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, Sonic is great. Yeah, but

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** better than that, but like Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** s***. Okay. Um, yeah, I hate when my monk player uses

**Justin Hale:** f***?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** sunning strike in my monsters. Um, all right. So, if I have advantage again, are will that cancel out the blind and

**Tyram:** Um

**Luke Neverisky:** disadvantage?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. So, you're rolling flat. Just a flat

**Luke Neverisky:** What? Uh, all right.

**Christopher Hooper:** roll. That it

**Luke Neverisky:** 19. Yeah. All right. Uh, nine

**Christopher Hooper:** hits. All right. Nine

**Luke Neverisky:** damage. I'm going to pop another one.

**Christopher Hooper:** damage.

**Luke Neverisky:** DC con. Uh, DC

**Tyram:** Yeah. Correct me if I'm wrong. Um, doesn't it say you can only

**Luke Neverisky:** con. Oh, you're right. You're so right. Thank

**Tyram:** do that once per turn now?

**Luke Neverisky:** you. That makes

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. I was wondering about

**Luke Neverisky:** sense. Um, all

**Tyram:** I guess a little bit of give and take with the

**Luke Neverisky:** right. Yeah, it's okay. That makes sense.

**Justin Hale:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Tyram:** updated uh sending

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, all right. Then in that case, I will use the focus point to flurry of

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** blows to do another two on strikes. Let me just see him get him. Let me

**Justin Hale:** No, I

**Christopher Hooper:** Get

**Luke Neverisky:** see. Okay, so I do not have advantage anymore from stunning strike because that was the next attack roll. Okay. Oh, that's a good point.


### [00:30:00]

**Tyram:** strike. You are still flanking with me though, so it's still a

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, still flat. Uh, that

**Tyram:** flat

**Luke Neverisky:** is all right. First one hits

**Justin Hale:** swear, you

**Luke Neverisky:** for eight damage. Second

**Christopher Hooper:** him. All right.

**Luke Neverisky:** one is going to be a miss. Uh, all

**Ellis Taylor:** Your name

**Luke Neverisky:** right. And Elma's going to stay right there because he's a nice flanking position. So that is the end of his

**Justin Hale:** terrible

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Tyram:** roll.

**Luke Neverisky:** turn.

**Christopher Hooper:** you hear a thrming.

**Tyram:** Goodbye.

**Ellis Taylor:** it

**Christopher Hooper:** yes.

**Luke Neverisky:** and see

**Ellis Taylor:** So I'm just like neutral now,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um you fail any ability check that

**Ellis Taylor:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** requires sight and attack roles against you have advantage and you have disadvantage on uh attack

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. So my attacks are just neutral

**Luke Neverisky:** how

**Tyram:** any you said anyone

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. All

**Ellis Taylor:** then.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Uh, and speaking of retired Detective Olivia Cooper, you're

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. So I have a very important question for you and I

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Ellis Taylor:** tried googling this while I was waiting for my turn. What are

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** gods considered? Are they considered like celestials or

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** fiends or specifically Helisana's god? I was trying to figure this out while we were talking and the general consensus is there is no consensus. So like

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I don't I

**Ali Leonard:** I love

**Ellis Taylor:** celestials, fiends, elementals.

**Christopher Hooper:** don't think there's a hard ruling here. Um, so

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. So it I mean it's going to make the decision

**Christopher Hooper:** what are you trying to

**Ellis Taylor:** of what I'm going to do. My plan was

**Christopher Hooper:** do?

**Ellis Taylor:** to use Bob's faceep to face step to Helisana

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** and use protect from good and evil on her. So she can't be um


### [01:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** protection grants several benefits creatures um bad disadvantage attack rules against the target. Target can't be possessed or gain charmed or frightened conditions. Um, if they're already possessed, it's it's gone and the target has advantage on saving throws against the relevant effect. So, trying to neutralize what the god like help her out with what the god's

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So, I actually thought a lot about

**Ellis Taylor:** doing. Uh-huh.

**Christopher Hooper:** this because of your aura and I don't think I don't think it appropriately like fits in the bucket of

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** charmed. So, what I wanted but I want to still res I think it's like an awesome use of it and appropriate use of it. So what I was thinking about how to use it is basically giving a boost to checks against these like charm like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** effects of and we will double your like bonus. So I think it's plus two and then it be up to

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Well, this was I was going to touch and give this to Helisana. Yeah, I don't see a plus two in

**Christopher Hooper:** plus4. Yeah. So you have a plus two

**Ellis Taylor:** here

**Christopher Hooper:** for your checks of your like aura,

**Ellis Taylor:** at those plus three.

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Plus three. Okay. So then uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Okay. To hell's

**Christopher Hooper:** you' be giving like a plus six to

**Ellis Taylor:** okay. All right. Well, I think that's worth it

**Luke Neverisky:** Don't

**Ellis Taylor:** because Helleana is hurting us a lot. So, I'm going to reach down and touch Silus's face and use

**Tyram:** I think I

**Ellis Taylor:** um No, I'm not I'm not

**Luke Neverisky:** hurt.

**Christopher Hooper:** Helisa. Hello

**Ellis Taylor:** moving yet. First, I was going to touch Silus and give him I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** sana.

**Ellis Taylor:** usually on hands on him as my bonus action and give him

**Tyram:** am.

**Ellis Taylor:** 20 hit points back and be

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. All right. So

**Ellis Taylor:** like, actually, oh, I can only do 10. Oh, I thought he just fell off.

**Christopher Hooper:** technically you need to move to him to touch

**Ellis Taylor:** I thought he just fell off Bob next to me.

**Christopher Hooper:** him. He got

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Sorry. On the map it just looked like he

**Christopher Hooper:** blasted.

**Ellis Taylor:** was right next to

**Christopher Hooper:** He is

**Ellis Taylor:** me. He's appropriately far

**Christopher Hooper:** appropriately far enough away that will open

**Ellis Taylor:** away. Oh well, I'll just shout at him. Get

**Christopher Hooper:** you up to opportunity

**Tyram:** Don't do that.

**Ellis Taylor:** out. Get up there and destroy those

**Christopher Hooper:** taxi.

**Ellis Taylor:** things. You're on your own, bud. And then I'll use I'll use the phase step to face step over. I gota touch them. Select. There we go. Next to Helisana. A It's not quite. Can I get like

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Ellis Taylor:** here?

**Christopher Hooper:** I believe uh it's 30 ft,

**Ellis Taylor:** No. The face step I can teleport 60 ft

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Oh, 60

**Tyram:** Sorry.

**Ellis Taylor:** away.

**Christopher Hooper:** ft. Yeah, you can get right next to him there. Anywhere around

**Ali Leonard:** Get all in

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Okay. And then I'm going to touch her and

**Christopher Hooper:** there. So this is going

**Ellis Taylor:** cast protect from good and

**Christopher Hooper:** to apply um

**Ali Leonard:** us.

**Ellis Taylor:** evil.

**Christopher Hooper:** appropriately. So protection what it's

**Tyram:** This is

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** protection from good and evil is that okay um

**Tyram:** so loud.

**Christopher Hooper:** so uh it it will apply

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** appropriately which means that it will not apply if Helisana is using her is trying to overpower this if that makes

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. So, it only helps the

**Tyram:** Where are you

**Luke Neverisky:** resist action, not the overpower action basically. Is that

**Tyram:** going?

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. And

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** sense. That's right. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** any other What about all the other checks? So she she all of a sudden get a plus six against

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** those two.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um uh yes, she should.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. So that was my action and then I guess

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'll use

**Christopher Hooper:** Is that your bonus two to face

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yes.

**Tyram:** Jesus.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. So I'm just going to use my movement and get right up next to Cr get myself between Kramer and everybody

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** you. Uh and then I'm going to shoot scorching ray at him

**Ellis Taylor:** Hey.

**Christopher Hooper:** I will I will

**Justin Hale:** her

**Christopher Hooper:** say meta meta combo wise if

**Ellis Taylor:** I know.

**Justin Hale:** what?

**Christopher Hooper:** if y'all don't focus on like one goal y'all are going

**Ellis Taylor:** I know. I I thoroughly regret my decision to come over and

**Justin Hale:** That is that what isn't that what we've been doing is fighting

**Christopher Hooper:** to die. No, you have been fighting Crang. Ellswith has been fighting the

**Justin Hale:** crank. No. Uh, hold

**Christopher Hooper:** panels. Um, Silus and Ma have been fighting the mobs and

**Justin Hale:** on. Let's Let's get one thing straight. Crane

**Christopher Hooper:** Helisana has been fighting her

**Ellis Taylor:** help

**Justin Hale:** came over to me. I haven't moved.

**Christopher Hooper:** god.

**Ali Leonard:** There.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Oh, that's your

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** I can only see 10 feet away from me. I can't fight anything but the

**Justin Hale:** fault. All

**Christopher Hooper:** And now Silus is honestly fighting in

**Tyram:** mobs.

**Ellis Taylor:** honestly silus

**Christopher Hooper:** existential

**Ellis Taylor:** getting knocked off Bob screwed my whole plans because I was going to misty step us both up

**Christopher Hooper:** questions.

**Ellis Taylor:** there and start going after the orars but then he got knocked off started getting possessed I'm just like

**Luke Neverisky:** Perfect.

**Justin Hale:** right. Time

**Ali Leonard:** And everybody dying has really thrown me

**Ellis Taylor:** god

**Justin Hale:** out. Time out. What are we doing

**Ali Leonard:** off. So if we could focus up

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Like y'all can This is a tactical

**Justin Hale:** then? All right. So, so calling a

**Christopher Hooper:** battle. We got a tactical map. Many people keep

**Justin Hale:** timeout. Calling a timeout. What are we

**Christopher Hooper:** getting

**Justin Hale:** doing? I have just been on the defensive with

**Ellis Taylor:** Huh?

**Justin Hale:** Crang because if I move, they're going to attack me anyways. I've tried to blind them multiple times. It ain't working because they have resistances of like plus 100. So, that ain't

**Christopher Hooper:** unconscious.

**Justin Hale:** working.

**Tyram:** Yeah, getting trying to roll saving throws seems like a losing battle. Um, I can't do anything but fight stuff that's within 10 feet of

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Tyram:** me right now. So, I'm I'm basically out of the strategy

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. So, what do we

**Tyram:** here. I am still blind,

**Ellis Taylor:** Did you get to the top?

**Justin Hale:** want to


### [01:40:00]

**Ali Leonard:** I'm to keep everyone

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm gonna try my best to roll like

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** alive is what I'm gonna

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Question. I have a to

**Justin Hale:** do?

**Ali Leonard:** do. So, it's

**Ellis Taylor:** to I have a question. If I move away because

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** right?

**Ellis Taylor:** I used um protect against good and evil on like touched her. If I move away, does she still get to keep that bonus? cuz it's a concentration spell. It's not like my

**Luke Neverisky:** s***.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think as long as

**Ali Leonard:** really

**Christopher Hooper:** you're I I think that one gets applied the the plus

**Ellis Taylor:** zone. Well, okay. So, hold on. Let's rewind because the what I did is I wanted I used the spell protect from good and evil on her, but we flavored that

**Christopher Hooper:** three.

**Ellis Taylor:** to like a plus six for my like aura protection. But it's a concentration spell. So if I moved

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Right. So like

**Ellis Taylor:** away, could she keep

**Justin Hale:** All the

**Christopher Hooper:** ampl she'll keep plus three of

**Ellis Taylor:** that? I plus three of it. Okay. Okay, that makes sense. So it's you were compounding the

**Justin Hale:** songs

**Ellis Taylor:** two effects.

**Justin Hale:** So, circling

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Right. Right.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, I think we should go I wanted to go

**Justin Hale:** back, what do we want to

**Ellis Taylor:** for the speakers.

**Justin Hale:** do? Okay. Where are the

**Ellis Taylor:** They're the two gold orbs next to Silus.

**Justin Hale:** speakers? Two gold

**Ali Leonard:** up on the

**Justin Hale:** orbs next to Oh, am I not Oh, okay. I'm not zoomed out far enough to even see that this whole time. I just saw Silus was gone

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, you didn't zoom

**Justin Hale:** and I was like, "Oh, okay." Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** out. All right,

**Ali Leonard:** hill. He did

**Justin Hale:** feet. I mean, I'm That's the other reason that I didn't move because I didn't want to get in the battle and I can't move very fast and then the battle came to

**Ellis Taylor:** Do you know how Misty slept?

**Justin Hale:** me. I do, but it's only 30 feet, right?

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. So, uh I can miss the step out

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** of here. Let's see. That'll get me to that square.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh. Oops. I didn't like that. I want to

**Christopher Hooper:** Do you uh do you have

**Justin Hale:** Pink

**Christopher Hooper:** a a ranged attack? Yeah, you have ranged attacks.

**Ellis Taylor:** measure. Yeah, you can just hit

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. So, you don't

**Ellis Taylor:** it. Please get away from Kramer.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** necessarily even need to move either,

**Ellis Taylor:** Hopefully

**Justin Hale:** well, I want to get away from Crane if uh if I'm not messing with

**Christopher Hooper:** but

**Justin Hale:** them. That's 40

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** feet. Um, okay. Wait, who's up there? Silus. Okay. All right. So, hold on. Give me one sec to reconfigure what I'm going to do

**Ellis Taylor:** Kramer

**Justin Hale:** here. Is there any fire around the uh speakers per

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh-huh. Is there any

**Justin Hale:** chance?

**Christopher Hooper:** fire?

**Ali Leonard:** Just

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** No.

**Ali Leonard:** a lot of bullet

**Ellis Taylor:** A can's

**Ali Leonard:** holes.

**Tyram:** and a halfling that I'm assuming is just like drooling all

**Justin Hale:** Um, how how does saving throws work against

**Tyram:** over himself at this

**Justin Hale:** the speakers? So, if

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, it depends on the saving throw, I would

**Tyram:** point.

**Justin Hale:** I'm going to do a con save against the

**Ellis Taylor:** missing.

**Christopher Hooper:** say. What's What's the

**Justin Hale:** speakers, either shatter or thunderwave, but both of them require the the things inside of it

**Christopher Hooper:** spell?

**Justin Hale:** to make a con

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. I I

**Justin Hale:** save.

**Christopher Hooper:** think I think Brew would guess that shatter would be really effective

**Tyram:** There you go.

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** against these things.

**Justin Hale:** Um, so I'm gonna cast. Can I hit both of them? Yes, probably. Square. Square. Is that a square? Yeah. Sphere. We Why? Why does it not center? That's really annoying.

**Christopher Hooper:** Why does it not

**Luke Neverisky:** Doesn't shatter automatically succeed against

**Justin Hale:** So, like

**Christopher Hooper:** center?

**Justin Hale:** that. I'm going to cast shatter. Uh, does it just work or do you need to make the con save of

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um, let me check real

**Luke Neverisky:** constructs?

**Christopher Hooper:** quick.

**Justin Hale:** 15?

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, um, do you roll damage if it if it

**Justin Hale:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** succeeds? Okay, just go ahead and roll damage.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. D8. One, two, three, four. Uh 19 damage

**Christopher Hooper:** Four

**Justin Hale:** to

**Christopher Hooper:** damage. All right.

**Justin Hale:** both

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, Flit, tell me how you're like casting the shatter on

**Justin Hale:** I'm pointing my uh my crossbow with all the thingies in it and firing in the

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Uh-huh.

**Justin Hale:** like equidistant between the two. And then and

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh-huh. And then it just what?

**Justin Hale:** then yeah, like

**Christopher Hooper:** Like

**Justin Hale:** not lightning, but almost like uh like broken glass out of nowhere. Like just the air turns into like broken glass and goes through the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. You You see your crossbow

**Justin Hale:** speakers.

**Christopher Hooper:** bolt go and it there's a beat and then it goes breaking and shattering. Uh the middle panel is gone. The second panel is almost

**Justin Hale:** mostetflix. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** destroyed. That was super

**Justin Hale:** Uh, hold on. One

**Christopher Hooper:** effective.

**Justin Hale:** second. One

**Tyram:** Oh my

**Justin Hale:** second. 120. Damn. Okay. Uh, Eldridge Cannon bonus action. Eldridge cannon force ballista on the remaining

**Christopher Hooper:** you

**Justin Hale:** one. Oh s***,

**Christopher Hooper:** used your bonus action to missy

**Tyram:** goodness.

**Justin Hale:** I forgot I did that.

**Christopher Hooper:** step and so I was wondering why

**Justin Hale:** Uh, yeah. Yeah. Well,

**Christopher Hooper:** you wanted to move.

**Justin Hale:** okay. I guess I already did it, so never

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** mind.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um Okay. Uh and then you see uh the ravers, they rush through and they say, "You will not stop

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** decides hold.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hinsley? I'm like I know his

**Tyram:** Yeah. True. I probably should have just said that.

**Christopher Hooper:** mom. Oh man, this is set up so well. Silus is up next with one in and a foot away from the final

**Tyram:** I I hope it f****** accomplishes something because yes, I'm try to stab the stupid

**Christopher Hooper:** panel. It looks

**Tyram:** speaker.

**Christopher Hooper:** in bad shape,

**Tyram:** Can a speaker take psychic

**Christopher Hooper:** so

**Tyram:** damage?

**Luke Neverisky:** So, you woke up this

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. Can it take uh

**Tyram:** Okay. Can it take sneak

**Christopher Hooper:** what' you say, Taylor? Uh I think

**Tyram:** attack? Sneak attack

**Christopher Hooper:** so. Does sneak attack damage Oh,

**Tyram:** damage.

**Christopher Hooper:** you mean like can it be

**Tyram:** Okay. Mechanically, I don't think there'd be an issue, but like I guess like lore of the

**Luke Neverisky:** morning.

**Christopher Hooper:** hexed?

**Tyram:** attack is I'm supposed to be hitting like a vital part. So I guess theoretically I can be stabbing like a like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean

**Tyram:** key mechanism within it or something. I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** just like finding a chink in armor, you'd be like finding a a weakness in the existing breaking panel. Yeah, I think that makes

**Tyram:** know. Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. So, you woke up this morning and chose

**Christopher Hooper:** sense.

**Tyram:** almost

**Christopher Hooper:** I actually it's like it's basically the same

**Tyram:** touch.

**Christopher Hooper:** difficulty but way simpler than what I had originally

**Luke Neverisky:** violence.

**Christopher Hooper:** planned. Um which has been very

**Luke Neverisky:** It helps when we uh don't focus the target or we're unable to for

**Christopher Hooper:** helpful. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** whatever

**Justin Hale:** Never ask me

**Tyram:** I mean, it's worse than having a downed party member, though, because you're actively making things

**Luke Neverisky:** reason. That is

**Tyram:** so much worse by like killing us right

**Luke Neverisky:** true.

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. But it's also having a really great character moment,

**Luke Neverisky:** It's like a really

**Christopher Hooper:** if I do say

**Tyram:** Okay. I I have no

**Justin Hale:** like, "Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** so.

**Tyram:** idea. His entire character arc has been

**Justin Hale:** god.

**Tyram:** internal. I have no f****** idea what any of this

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, we really should talk to Helisana about

**Tyram:** means. I mean, I guess that's

**Christopher Hooper:** her drug problem. I

**Tyram:** it. They

**Luke Neverisky:** good

**Christopher Hooper:** do

**Tyram:** never even told us about the goddamn drug

**Ellis Taylor:** Has the drugs been like masking

**Justin Hale:** You want me to sit on the

**Ellis Taylor:** her deity's call or does she just have a drug

**Tyram:** problem.

**Ellis Taylor:** problem or more

**Justin Hale:** ball? It's

**Christopher Hooper:** think um I don't know. We'll have to unramp that afterwards, I

**Tyram:** Brave of you to assume there's an

**Ellis Taylor:** power?


### [02:10:00]

**Tyram:** afterwards. You must have thought it was so funny. I'm like, "Hey, here's Silus's like plan for after this battle." Knowing full well all along

**Justin Hale:** not

**Christopher Hooper:** think. Sure, Taylor, come up

**Tyram:** there wasn't going to be after this battle.

**Christopher Hooper:** with this elaborate plan cuz Silus will be

**Ellis Taylor:** Tober was actually really just tired of the

**Christopher Hooper:** dead.

**Tyram:** That's looking increasingly likely. I mean, if they hit

**Ellis Taylor:** campaign.

**Tyram:** me one more time with the intelligence drain, I am comeomaosse, I think. I'm hoping they can't

**Justin Hale:** That's what I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I think they're distracted

**Tyram:** climb, so I don't

**Justin Hale:** hoping

**Christopher Hooper:** right now.

**Justin Hale:** too. Some Misty stepping out of there on my

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Tyram:** know.

**Justin Hale:** turn.

**Christopher Hooper:** was curious because a lot of Brew's stuff is dependent on his int and I was wondering if it um gets affected. Oh, it looks

**Justin Hale:** Yep. You

**Christopher Hooper:** like Yeah, the modifier

**Tyram:** Yes. Everything Brew does is actively worse

**Justin Hale:** betcha. You

**Christopher Hooper:** changes. Yeah, man. That's that's

**Tyram:** now.

**Justin Hale:** betcha. Yeah. So, so clever. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** clever.

**Luke Neverisky:** What a good team. I'm going to start

**Justin Hale:** just over. You are the

**Tyram:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead. Oh,

**Tyram:** speaker. Okay, I rolled well.

**Christopher Hooper:** man. That hits

**Tyram:** 24. All right. Um, I didn't have advantage and I don't have an ally, so it's just a normal stab. And I

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's It's still there. It's still

**Tyram:** damage. Okay, bonus action.

**Christopher Hooper:** panel?

**Tyram:** up there. He's like basically just like full-on Frankenstein's monster like running away and he's like and like this thing is really loud and I hate it and so I just go up to it and I'm like like pushing my

**Justin Hale:** Everyone Same

**Christopher Hooper:** and it um at that at that point um a swirling wind um erupts

**Tyram:** back

**Christopher Hooper:** around uh You now hear music not from the speakers but from all around you. Uh the the ravers crang ease back all of you are it's it's it's everywhere. It's overwhelming. Helisana

Helisana the the being now walks into the plane next to you. that that being that you made a pack with it, a monstrosity uh overwhelming and and unable indescribable by visual effects, but more by a presence in all in all presence that now hovers behind uh the person you once were with their tentacles wrapping around them and then wrapping around you. And they offer you and they say come back. Come back to young Chuck

**Luke Neverisky:** 24

**Christopher Hooper:** you look at yourself and you really see that what the cost has been to this act that you

**Ellis Taylor:** What's

**Christopher Hooper:** made. And at that point, you start you start digging into the earth to into the fabric around you. You start to try to pull it out. And you've tried this before, but but for some reason you feel stronger now. like uh and then you you you realize there's a little there's a there's a spirit of this little little dwarven little dwarven outline right next to you helping you rip apart

**Luke Neverisky:** for

**Christopher Hooper:** the veil that's been keeping you from

**Luke Neverisky:** him.

**Christopher Hooper:** reality and

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** and they say let's tip the scales. You hear the god here help you rip open the reality and you fall out. What you what the rest of your party sees is um a huge uh flash of light uh centered on Helisana and a a crackling of lightning and then a reverb, a sound of Mike uh recording itself, hearing itself and it's it's horrifying that that terrible terrible horri terrific sound and then uh the sound of rakes against chalkboard and the breaking of reality and then you see these two women fall away from each other. One Helisana, another this this young woman that you've never seen before. almost like a twin of Helisana as if she were I don't know like a like naive bookish person and then it all falls silent. The ravers uh seem to collect themselves and they they go back into the bar and they go back into the underlake. Ma um seems to just fall down and go to sleep. Uh and Helisana now stands before

**Luke Neverisky:** like two of

**Ali Leonard:** you?

**Tyram:** know.

**Christopher Hooper:** on the gates of the forart

**Ellis Taylor:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** um and helping you overthrow Helia. What it also seems like is a even more powerful entity um using Helisana as a conduit is going to try to completely take over the city. What with that with that insight check you foresee a possibly cataclysmic battle

**Ellis Taylor:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** between the Dragons,

**Justin Hale:** Yes. Bless

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, the Ravers headed by Helisana and

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** her patron and you, I guess, if you want to

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Should we just

**Christopher Hooper:** stick around to find

**Ali Leonard:** Well,

**Ellis Taylor:** evacuate the city and let them destroy

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Ellis Taylor:** it? Let them all destroy each other. This is Ellis, not

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia. I want to do a Can I do a

**Luke Neverisky:** interesting.

**Tyram:** All right, Carol King.

**Ellis Taylor:** religion check to see if I can figure it

**Tyram:** If we were to Oh, we get the Okay,

**Ellis Taylor:** out? It's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, go ahead

**Christopher Hooper:** Ellis

**Ellis Taylor:** 11. And I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** 11. You're you're trying to see if you know anything about Helis on his

**Ellis Taylor:** not Yeah, I'm not inspired.

**Christopher Hooper:** patron. No, you've never

**Justin Hale:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** heard anything about uncheck. All

**Ali Leonard:** That's not even

**Tyram:** whatever.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Here, help me.

**Christopher Hooper:** right, Taylor, you are going into

**Ali Leonard:** a real

**Justin Hale:** think I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** character. Fire off.

**Ali Leonard:** word.

**Tyram:** Okay,

**Ali Leonard:** There

**Tyram:** feist I say talking to Liliana.

**Ali Leonard:** we go.

**Tyram:** Um, if we were to if we were to bring you into contact with your other half, is there any way

**Justin Hale:** You're talking

**Tyram:** we could get some control of the situation again? Like, is there any chance that you could fight off regain control from this f****** squid monster that you sold your

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh gee.

**Justin Hale:** about

**Tyram:** goddamn soul

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh I I don't know. Worth a

**Ali Leonard:** Don't love the lack of

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Ali Leonard:** confidence.

**Tyram:** to? Okay, huddle up team. Not you, I say

**Luke Neverisky:** shot. That's

**Tyram:** to uh Liliana. Actually, I guess I'm still psychically linked to you guys. I just talk to you all in psychic conference call here. Um, all

**Justin Hale:** actually Oh god.

**Tyram:** right. Maybe

**Justin Hale:** Is it

**Tyram:** our best chance of still pulling a

**Luke Neverisky:** okay.

**Tyram:** save out of all this. We go through with our original plan to take out

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Tyram:** Helga. We could maybe use the orb, just tell the dragons to f*** off. And then the Hail Mary as we take uh Stevie Nicks over here and

**Justin Hale:** The first

**Tyram:** have her

**Justin Hale:** enemy

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** like reemerge with Helisana and maybe bring back

**Justin Hale:** is That's

**Tyram:** the slightly less of a pain in the ass Helisana that we've been dealing with up to this

**Justin Hale:** not

**Tyram:** point. I feel like we are past the point of evacuation being a viable option here. There's no way we can evacuate this whole city with dragons up above it in less than two days. Am I right or wrong? I have no

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. No, I agree with that. Um

**Justin Hale:** question. That kind of sounds like a

**Ellis Taylor:** Gosh. Yeah, it's her

**Justin Hale:** decision for bet on

**Ellis Taylor:** choice though to if she wants to emerge back cuz she finally has her

**Tyram:** idea.

**Ellis Taylor:** herself back essentially, but we

**Tyram:** herself doesn't seem particularly

**Ellis Taylor:** can Well, you just met

**Tyram:** useful to me, but I don't

**Ellis Taylor:** her. I know you want your money maker back, Silus. I understand that. But it is ultimately her

**Justin Hale:** the

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. And we've got a great

**Tyram:** know.

**Ali Leonard:** idea for that pizza truck. So, it's like that's going to print

**Ellis Taylor:** decision.

**Ali Leonard:** money.

**Tyram:** Well, I guess that's a nice fall back. But hey, I'm I am This is as altruistic as I get here. I'm trying to think of a way

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Where's

**Tyram:** to not have this city be ruled over by a

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. And I'd love to save

**Tyram:** squid god.

**Ali Leonard:** Alisana from

**Tyram:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, I'd like to save both

**Ali Leonard:** being take it whatever she is

**Ellis Taylor:** Helisanas. Um, we might

**Ali Leonard:** possessed. Yeah, absolutely.

**Ellis Taylor:** need to do a little figuring out of what deity this is and figure out what to do. Oh, Lord. Oh,

**Tyram:** need actually you guys saying that I'm going to look over

**Ellis Taylor:** dear.

**Tyram:** at uh Liliana and be

**Luke Neverisky:** It's


### [02:40:00]

**Tyram:** like Liliana was there

**Luke Neverisky:** hi

**Ali Leonard:** Hey

**Tyram:** any part of Helisana that genuinely

**Justin Hale:** How's this

**Tyram:** cared for

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, would I have access to like her thoughts or is it merely that I'm just looking out from this

**Justin Hale:** one?

**Tyram:** us. Aren't you guys like kind of the same

**Ellis Taylor:** Why is she

**Ali Leonard:** girl.

**Luke Neverisky:** door?

**Justin Hale:** Excuse

**Christopher Hooper:** Um I I don't I don't I think um you have access to like any thoughts that Helisa didn't

**Tyram:** person?

**Ellis Taylor:** compartmentalized?

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. I can't really

**Christopher Hooper:** share with you, but you got to see everything for sure. And maybe yeah, maybe you all had

**Luke Neverisky:** tell. I mean, I couldn't exactly tell,

**Justin Hale:** me. Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** conversations

**Luke Neverisky:** but it seemed like she looked out for you. I mean, maybe she had her own I mean, from what I hear, she was kind of selfish, but um I think she I think there's something there. But I just I feel like I know you guys so well. So, you know, I I already care for

**Ali Leonard:** So is Helandi you or are you two separate

**Tyram:** Well, s***. I guess we're betting everything on

**Ellis Taylor:** It

**Justin Hale:** god.

**Ali Leonard:** people?

**Tyram:** that. Great.

**Ellis Taylor:** sounds like she got trapped inside the brain when when Helisana accepted Liliana I guess

**Ali Leonard:** So yeah. So

**Ellis Taylor:** accepted the deal. This got compartmentalized over

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Ali Leonard:** like the deal was

**Ellis Taylor:** here. Do you feel different, honey? Or do you feel the

**Ali Leonard:** accepted.

**Ellis Taylor:** same like before and

**Luke Neverisky:** I feel I

**Justin Hale:** Thanks. And

**Luke Neverisky:** mean now that I'm like actually able to like move my legs and stuff, I feel

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Ellis Taylor:** after? Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** great. Feel

**Justin Hale:** now

**Ali Leonard:** Right. Right. Right. I

**Tyram:** I'm just worried that if Helisana truly the the Helisana that exists now truly did not give

**Luke Neverisky:** great.

**Tyram:** a single s*** about us then this is a pretty hopeless

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yeah. No, I'm I think

**Ali Leonard:** bet. I'd like to think

**Ellis Taylor:** I think we're in big trouble with her

**Justin Hale:** What's

**Ali Leonard:** that she

**Ellis Taylor:** just taking over the city and it becoming her own private

**Justin Hale:** that?

**Ellis Taylor:** neverending

**Tyram:** gambit. I'm just worried about us hoping that the power of friendship helps

**Ali Leonard:** did.

**Tyram:** us here when this was the person who apparently thought the least of us, you

**Ellis Taylor:** rave. Yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Right.

**Ellis Taylor:** only one that got his character name,

**Justin Hale:** I want it.

**Christopher Hooper:** s***." Um, okay. So, what Elizabeth would know with with a

**Ali Leonard:** What?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** 23? Um,

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Ellis Taylor:** too.

**Christopher Hooper:** not a lot. Um, you maybe have heard of of this

**Tyram:** this

**Christopher Hooper:** in in some of the you know how there are like very very old folk

**Justin Hale:** Who says that?

**Christopher Hooper:** tales that are like passed

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** down and you you heard um Flash Genius will get you plus

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** four. Is that right?

**Justin Hale:** me. Yes, it'll give

**Ali Leonard:** me.

**Justin Hale:** with

**Christopher Hooper:** 19 or the 22 or the

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** decisions. I think I'll I think I'll use it on

**Christopher Hooper:** 23?

**Justin Hale:** probably else I

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Uh,

**Justin Hale:** guess.

**Christopher Hooper:** so what? That's uh 27. Um, I'm just going to check. I'm

**Justin Hale:** Indeed.

**Christopher Hooper:** going to roll for just real quick, just in case. Okay, he doesn't eject s***. Okay. Um, okay. So, Elmith is up to 27. So, Elmith has heard I feel like dwarves probably have a pretty common

**Justin Hale:** Huh?

**Christopher Hooper:** like oral story culture of passing down stories through lineage, especially with like the long lifespans. And so, um, uh, Elizabeth remembers hearing as a child these stories of, um, some of the scariest stories, um, were not of of the monster in the forest, but the monsters that would attack your mind uh, with music. Um, and they would hover into the deepness of the earth. And some

**Justin Hale:** Awesome. Enemy

**Christopher Hooper:** of the earliest dwarves were the most scared of these entities deep within the earth that were almost timeless beings. And uh, often they drew people that were drawn to music itself. they would be drawn in with this hum of of and and the the the music

**Justin Hale:** Watching.

**Christopher Hooper:** evolved a lot with time as it explored different uh different eons. Um and there were stories that dwarves would be drawn into the

**Justin Hale:** Check

**Christopher Hooper:** deep bowels of the earth and never seen again. And uh they actually called this being um Ruth talk um in the dwarven tongue. Uh but um you

**Justin Hale:** this.

**Christopher Hooper:** you think that this probably is ach um and it uh those stories talk about like the first the first dwarfs here. That was one of the first things that they were worried about. They they thought they had found a home and uh it's one of the earliest stories that you had ever heard about um timewise.

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um and as as time went on um occasionally would emerge. Uh but it seems like using a religion and that high religion

**Justin Hale:** What's

**Christopher Hooper:** check and reflecting on all the things that are happening. uh you've kind of gathered that a lot of the a lot of the gods that influence this world are reaching in from another plane of existence and their power um they have to work through like intermediaries for the most part. Um, and you believe that by

**Justin Hale:** Jesus.

**Christopher Hooper:** weakening the fabric between realities that a lot of these um beings have stronger uh influence than they did before. Um, and it looks like this one of the oldest beings that is almost beyond it's it's not even a a god you know of as

**Justin Hale:** Silence.

**Christopher Hooper:** being like the god of of hills or the god of lightning. It's like the god of

**Justin Hale:** The final


### [02:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** the spirit of sad music or like music that makes you feel negative things like um uh some some mythologies talk about

**Justin Hale:** description.

**Christopher Hooper:** um god the the earliest primordial gods being ones of an orchestra and this is the god of percussion and and uh drums and um and now it be has has soaken into uh electronic music.

**Justin Hale:** Wow. Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** Um what that means

**Justin Hale:** s***.

**Christopher Hooper:** for today uh you don't believe it necessarily has a a will that's natural to you in that like it doesn't really want things. it just spreads almost like like grass growing or a tree spreading its canopy. Um if there's fertile ground, it will continue to move into that fertile ground. Um, and so to be able to recede it, you there's you could probably think to, you know, weaken like further strengthen the fabric between realities that is currently causing a lot of these issues. Um, potentially there's the approach that the Eldorans have done, which is to become god killers. And maybe you could take that route. Um, or you could naturally find the way that it normally uh recedes from from civilized life by, you know, promoting music that brings joy or or anti- music or, you know, uh, finding people jobs so they stop going to rock clubs or, um, um

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** you know, stabilizing them in families so they don't have time to go to concerts anymore. Um you know, the classic things that keep you from the grunge scene, so to

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** speak. So that's uh that's what

**Luke Neverisky:** Huh? Good roll.

**Christopher Hooper:** a 27 gets

**Luke Neverisky:** You got that deep

**Ali Leonard:** D

**Justin Hale:** the deep

**Christopher Hooper:** you.

**Ali Leonard:** s***. Hey guys, I actually know a

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, y'all. I'm like super

**Justin Hale:** lore like you don't even

**Luke Neverisky:** s***. That all sounds All

**Justin Hale:** old

**Christopher Hooper:** god. That old

**Luke Neverisky:** right, good

**Christopher Hooper:** god.

**Ali Leonard:** it. I actually spent my entire childhood learning about the specific

**Ellis Taylor:** It was my hyperspixation. It's

**Justin Hale:** shirt and you just now

**Ali Leonard:** god. Perfect. So that's

**Ellis Taylor:** fine.

**Luke Neverisky:** job.

**Justin Hale:** remembered. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool.

**Ali Leonard:** the god

**Luke Neverisky:** Sounds

**Justin Hale:** So they so they spread like a

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. So

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** So, is your music depressing, Liliana, or are

**Ellis Taylor:** we are you kind of

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, good. Yeah. Gosh. I

**Justin Hale:** weed.

**Ali Leonard:** you kind of

**Luke Neverisky:** mean, what's the point of music if it's not if it's not happy or at least some

**Ali Leonard:** poppy? Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** sort of,

**Ali Leonard:** Interesting. So, that's good. So, at least we got the power of positivity over here.

**Tyram:** Okay. So, our Hail Mary

**Ellis Taylor:** happy

**Tyram:** play is we take uh Damn, I'm trying to think of like a really upbeat singer.

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Justin Hale:** Mr. Mr.

**Ali Leonard:** Um with the

**Tyram:** Um, oh yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Moras with the hate. He's got that

**Ali Leonard:** hat. Yeah. Kobe Cala.

**Justin Hale:** hate. Oh, true.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Um, okay. So, we take Kobe Cala over here. Kobe Cal I feel

**Justin Hale:** Female. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you

**Tyram:** like works. Okay. Okay. Okay, so we take Kobe

**Justin Hale:** do you crinkle your nose by

**Tyram:** Cow over here and try to mend the broken soul of Helisana and overcome their evil grungy metal god with a positive vibes

**Justin Hale:** chance?

**Tyram:** uh spiritual healing

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, in two days. Yeah, for

**Tyram:** vibe. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** sure.

**Tyram:** But like that's is that what we're going to try to do after we defeat the Iron Claws is just try to throw uh Kobe Cala over here at Helisana and hope that it lands in

**Ellis Taylor:** that or we get to

**Ali Leonard:** I mean, I think I would help her. I

**Tyram:** our favor. Well, we need I guess we need to think about

**Luke Neverisky:** There's

**Tyram:** ways we can like tip the scales in our favor there, right? Like how can we help

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I

**Tyram:** uh Liliana here win that battle of the

**Luke Neverisky:** mean the dwarf thing that got me out said something about tipping

**Tyram:** soul?

**Ellis Taylor:** work.

**Ali Leonard:** don't

**Tyram:** Oh, was this the dwarf thing? I point over at uh

**Luke Neverisky:** skills. I don't think so. Were you in No, I

**Ellis Taylor:** What? I I mean

**Luke Neverisky:** don't think that was

**Ali Leonard:** So there was another thing

**Tyram:** Olivia. Oh, I I legitimately thought

**Ellis Taylor:** I I thought it was a nice spell

**Ali Leonard:** in

**Tyram:** that was like Olivia's spell helping you, but I Okay, never

**Ellis Taylor:** helping you, but then did say tier said like let's set the

**Luke Neverisky:** you. Oh, was it

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** scales.

**Justin Hale:** I

**Tyram:** mind. Yeah, so that's why I thought it was you.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** interesting. I just assumed it was some random girl.

**Christopher Hooper:** It was your spell, but

**Tyram:** Was it not Olivia?

**Christopher Hooper:** uh an avatar of tier

**Ali Leonard:** M okay.

**Tyram:** So like the dwarven form wasn't just Olivia's like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** likely. No. No.

**Ali Leonard:** It was it was tear

**Tyram:** shade or something.

**Ellis Taylor:** it was here through my m

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, it

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** herself. I

**Justin Hale:** didn't sound like Olivia's my

**Ali Leonard:** got a a vision of tear.

**Ellis Taylor:** um I mean we can try that.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** I have a feeling we're gonna have to fix this whole ripping fabric

**Tyram:** Wow.

**Ellis Taylor:** in reality thing,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, seems

**Ali Leonard:** H. It doesn't sound

**Ellis Taylor:** too. f*** if I know. What do

**Justin Hale:** thing.

**Ali Leonard:** great. Do I need to

**Tyram:** Okay. How do we do

**Ellis Taylor:** you think I

**Justin Hale:** You're

**Ali Leonard:** think real hard again? Let me just let me just think real

**Tyram:** that? So, yeah, let's uh I think we got to I think we

**Justin Hale:** the You're the big You're the big brain

**Ali Leonard:** hard.

**Tyram:** got to tackle the problem in front of us first, right? Which is to

**Luke Neverisky:** like

**Justin Hale:** to pay for the

**Tyram:** stop Alisana from becoming

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, she um

**Tyram:** the metal dictator of this

**Ellis Taylor:** am?

**Luke Neverisky:** she probably would do not great things with that just from what I've

**Tyram:** city.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I agree with you. It

**Luke Neverisky:** seen.

**Justin Hale:** group. All right.

**Ali Leonard:** So, we have to get her off

**Ellis Taylor:** sounds like we need to write a really upbeat, beautiful

**Ali Leonard:** of the

**Ellis Taylor:** song to heal the home. I don't

**Luke Neverisky:** Problem

**Ali Leonard:** radio. So, now we have to do

**Ellis Taylor:** know. Yes, we

**Ali Leonard:** the

**Ellis Taylor:** do. I know. I was thinking we got to

**Ali Leonard:** intervention. Can we pretend to give her cocaine and actually

**Ellis Taylor:** write

**Justin Hale:** Isn't cocaine or

**Ali Leonard:** give her an upper? Wait, cocaine is an

**Luke Neverisky:** Neither

**Justin Hale:** not? Yes, it is. We

**Ali Leonard:** upper. I don't I don't know.

**Ellis Taylor:** golden.

**Luke Neverisky:** do I. Know what she

**Justin Hale:** just give her We give her baking

**Ali Leonard:** Drug weed. Should we give

**Ellis Taylor:** Um I'm not sure an upper is the best decision. I feel

**Justin Hale:** soda.

**Ali Leonard:** her weed? No, we need to give her

**Ellis Taylor:** like

**Luke Neverisky:** did. Like a nice cup of

**Ali Leonard:** a like a calm

**Ellis Taylor:** downers isn't good

**Luke Neverisky:** tea or

**Ali Leonard:** uh like what's a happy

**Tyram:** Maybe it's more like a power of

**Ellis Taylor:** either.

**Tyram:** friendship thing more so than like, you know, getting them

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we

**Ali Leonard:** pill?

**Tyram:** high.

**Ellis Taylor:** can make her very suggestible by ship like slipping or something, but that's not what I think either.

**Luke Neverisky:** something. That

**Ali Leonard:** like so

**Luke Neverisky:** takes about four weeks to set in. I don't know.

**Ali Leonard:** loft. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We don't have

**Justin Hale:** Maybe a little Maybe a little Xanax

**Ali Leonard:** time. Sure. What if we just kind of have her sleep the whole

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, she usually sleeps after

**Ali Leonard:** time?

**Luke Neverisky:** she has, you know, partaken in the drugs, but she's she's

**Justin Hale:** action.

**Luke Neverisky:** sitting right now. We're about

**Justin Hale:** So maybe we find

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah. She's looking right

**Justin Hale:** where she's sleeping and we tie her up and we continue to knock her

**Ali Leonard:** now. She scares

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, we need her for the

**Luke Neverisky:** to

**Christopher Hooper:** Y'all going to go fight her right

**Tyram:** Do we need to deal with

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I feel

**Justin Hale:** out.

**Tyram:** her before or after the uh

**Ellis Taylor:** like after Well,

**Christopher Hooper:** now?

**Ali Leonard:** me. mid when she's

**Tyram:** concert?

**Ellis Taylor:** we

**Luke Neverisky:** Don't

**Justin Hale:** So maybe maybe we sit at the concert and at the end of the concert I point the fireworks at her

**Ali Leonard:** busy. Think

**Justin Hale:** face. No, it's not kill. It's just knockout. Just a

**Ali Leonard:** we're trying to kill

**Luke Neverisky:** see it. the

**Justin Hale:** little sleepy time. It's fine. It could

**Ali Leonard:** Alisana. Are they sleepy

**Luke Neverisky:** SL.

**Justin Hale:** be. Depends on how hard they hit. I don't know. Every firework is

**Ali Leonard:** fireworks?

**Justin Hale:** different. Listen, every firework

**Ali Leonard:** So they will cause pain and burning.

**Ellis Taylor:** No.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Yeah. But

**Justin Hale:** different. All right? Some be sparkles, some be big

**Luke Neverisky:** like she probably

**Justin Hale:** booms. It's hard to tell

**Ali Leonard:** Do you have a

**Luke Neverisky:** deserves it though, right? Like she's kind of rude to

**Ali Leonard:** Zoloft firework? I mean,

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Ali Leonard:** she's Yeah, but that's just Helisana. I mean, she's still our friend. My

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, no.

**Justin Hale:** sometimes. Who can

**Ali Leonard:** friend, right? Wait, am I overthinking

**Justin Hale:** say

**Ali Leonard:** this? She never said we

**Ellis Taylor:** Coincidence.

**Justin Hale:** Do you want to reabsorb weird?

**Ali Leonard:** were friends.

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Justin Hale:** This this Curry

**Ali Leonard:** No, I love I mean I don't know you. I love your vibe is what I was going to say,

**Luke Neverisky:** don't I mean I just I don't

**Justin Hale:** Harrison, do you want to resorb her like twin in

**Ali Leonard:** but I also love Helisana. I

**Luke Neverisky:** want to be trapped in there again, though.

**Ali Leonard:** want I don't want her to be trapped. She's her own

**Tyram:** I think our

**Justin Hale:** womb?

**Tyram:** ideal uh thing would be to recombine them, but let

**Justin Hale:** So then just His

**Ali Leonard:** person. But

**Tyram:** Liliana here be the dominant personality this

**Justin Hale:** son is trapped inside. That sounds bad

**Ali Leonard:** then I don't want anybody trapped.

**Tyram:** time.

**Justin Hale:** too. What

**Tyram:** Maybe not like we're we're maybe we've make it in such a way where that neither of them is trapped, but they truly become a whole

**Ali Leonard:** a whole person. I would love

**Tyram:** person, right? They reintegrate. It's not just like

**Luke Neverisky:** begin.

**Justin Hale:** if

**Tyram:** Helisana's in the in the timeout corner this time, but rather we feel we mend the broken soul of Liliana. You're the original,

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh yeah, I mean we were we were one, right? And


### [03:00:00]

**Tyram:** right?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. But do you feel

**Justin Hale:** That's not that's not

**Ali Leonard:** that. One

**Tyram:** I would love yes or no answers from you, Lilian. I just got to

**Ellis Taylor:** any do you ever feel

**Justin Hale:** listen but that's not good question because if you ask that question of course they're going

**Luke Neverisky:** then Yeah, of course. The

**Justin Hale:** to say the original they won't

**Luke Neverisky:** original

**Justin Hale:** believe we how we

**Tyram:** say I don't know

**Ellis Taylor:** upset? I guess we're trying to figure

**Justin Hale:** translate

**Ellis Taylor:** out if they're a fractured being or if Helisana is like a new

**Tyram:** insight. Uh 18. Do I believe that

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah. Is hell kind of just like a construct of this

**Tyram:** Liliana?

**Ali Leonard:** god? Like is she not even like It

**Justin Hale:** Do you feel like

**Ali Leonard:** was Liliana the good the the personality

**Ellis Taylor:** being like essentially did she split

**Justin Hale:** you're

**Ali Leonard:** in her and then that was taken out and now it's just like a husk of

**Ellis Taylor:** into her ying and yang essentially.

**Justin Hale:** so Yeah. Do you Liliana? Do you feel like you're missing part of you? Do you feel like

**Tyram:** Yeah, I feel like that's what I want. Like

**Justin Hale:** you're missing parts of yourself?

**Tyram:** I I

**Luke Neverisky:** What?

**Justin Hale:** You feel like there's a part of you where there's a hole missing like a dark creepy

**Luke Neverisky:** No.

**Justin Hale:** gothic style

**Ali Leonard:** pelis

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. All

**Luke Neverisky:** Like, no. I mean, that's that's her vibe. That's not my

**Ellis Taylor:** right.

**Luke Neverisky:** vibe.

**Justin Hale:** hole. I would just kill her. No, it's

**Tyram:** I I mean we like like Olivia said, we need to know if you guys are like incomplete parts of a greater whole or if one of you is indeed like a just a simalcram. You

**Luke Neverisky:** Me

**Justin Hale:** on. I'm just saying what is what is worse what is worse thing to

**Tyram:** know, you are literally the only one who can tell us that. So, um do

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't know how this this deities

**Tyram:** you happen to

**Luke Neverisky:** thing works, but what I can tell you is when

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** I chose not to go to that shrine, I woke up inside of that

**Tyram:** know

**Luke Neverisky:** house.

**Ali Leonard:** How did you So you said no and then

**Luke Neverisky:** Listen, I don't know how you

**Ali Leonard:** you

**Luke Neverisky:** you guys have I've seen you guys have like worked with timelines and stuff. I almost swear. Jeez. Um things like

**Ali Leonard:** still

**Tyram:** Very different. Very different

**Luke Neverisky:** that. I mean, isn't it like your friend Victor or whatever? Is that

**Justin Hale:** I'm

**Tyram:** from Victor

**Luke Neverisky:** like

**Justin Hale:** just if He is our He is our buddy. He is

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, Victor's not our

**Tyram:** is not our

**Justin Hale:** our best friend.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** friend. He's Bru's acquaintance

**Tyram:** friend.

**Justin Hale:** He is best. He's such strong

**Tyram:** I hate Victor.

**Luke Neverisky:** It is a

**Ali Leonard:** colleague.

**Tyram:** It's not strong enough. But anyway,

**Luke Neverisky:** problem. I mean, you you know Victor, right? You've seen multiple Victors. I mean, couldn't this just like be

**Tyram:** continue. Wait, wait. Sorry. Wait. Time

**Luke Neverisky:** similar? Uh or who was the V?

**Tyram:** out. Have we seen multiple

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh no, Scarlet. Sorry, Scarlet. I'm thinking about

**Justin Hale:** word.

**Tyram:** victors?

**Luke Neverisky:** Victor. Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting my NPCs

**Tyram:** Oh, okay. Okay. Sure. Yeah, we saw. But that was like alternate universe

**Ali Leonard:** Was that like a time knife? Time

**Tyram:** stuff. And as far as I can tell, we're all in the same universe here.

**Luke Neverisky:** confused. What was

**Justin Hale:** Wait, are you timed on timeline? Helis

**Ali Leonard:** guy.

**Tyram:** Yeah. The time

**Luke Neverisky:** that? Have my time

**Justin Hale:** on. Are you timed on timeline

**Luke Neverisky:** gone. Oh, I couldn't follow all of that. That was even I was I wasn't even there. I was just watching. I couldn't follow all of it.

**Justin Hale:** helis? I

**Ali Leonard:** Not a great

**Luke Neverisky:** That really drug my

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** people Okay. I just want to know what we're what the situation is so that we can know what the right thing

**Justin Hale:** I listen what is

**Ali Leonard:** episode. And that's the issue. We don't know what the issue

**Tyram:** to do is. You

**Justin Hale:** worst case scenario if helisa

**Ali Leonard:** is.

**Tyram:** know, there like a psychiatry textbook we could reference

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Ali Leonard:** Is the library still

**Tyram:** about this or

**Luke Neverisky:** brain.

**Justin Hale:** die. If we kill Alisa, what is worse to

**Ellis Taylor:** know. All right. How about this? How about this,

**Justin Hale:** happens?

**Ali Leonard:** standing? She

**Tyram:** something. Olivia or Elmith, do either of your gods know? I mean, can they help

**Ellis Taylor:** Lily?

**Ali Leonard:** dies. Well, I haven't found mine

**Tyram:** us here? Damn

**Ellis Taylor:** I feel like Pier was involved,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. It's okay. You'll find it. You'll find

**Ali Leonard:** yet.

**Ellis Taylor:** but I don't think he's going to tell me

**Justin Hale:** Right.

**Ali Leonard:** He's being very cagy for some reason.

**Ellis Taylor:** anything. I don't know

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** My

**Tyram:** it. Why does tear not help? I'm so sick of tear being so

**Ellis Taylor:** how I was looking through my stuff. I don't even know how to ask him for

**Justin Hale:** It's a lot easier when when the person you worship is person you

**Tyram:** obstinate.

**Justin Hale:** live

**Christopher Hooper:** True

**Ellis Taylor:** help. Okay, I have an idea.

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** god.

**Tyram:** You know, Brew, you don't say a lot of things that

**Ellis Taylor:** Lily

**Tyram:** make sense, but I gota I got to give you that one.

**Ellis Taylor:** Luke, do you know if they're split or not? Like if we keep asking you

**Justin Hale:** on. Yeah. Can you just Can you just give us the cheat codes,

**Ali Leonard:** Can you just tell

**Ellis Taylor:** questions.

**Luke Neverisky:** I mean once she told

**Justin Hale:** man? Come on. Just give

**Ali Leonard:** us

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Just can you say just you could just say yes or no? You know what's going

**Tyram:** Is there

**Ellis Taylor:** on.

**Tyram:** like a ritual we could do to like help you find the answers for

**Ellis Taylor:** No.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, that I don't know. That I don't

**Tyram:** yourself or

**Luke Neverisky:** know. All, like I said, all I know is that there was an event, there was a split in which

**Justin Hale:** us

**Luke Neverisky:** case uh Liliana did not go,

**Ellis Taylor:** I wonder if it's

**Luke Neverisky:** but she also did.

**Tyram:** something?

**Ellis Taylor:** just two timelines

**Tyram:** I wonder if um Helisana and Liliana had a split personality thing going on

**Ellis Taylor:** converging. Yeah, I asked that a while ago, but

**Tyram:** before the pact and maybe maybe Helisana did say yes to the pact because that seems like a requisite for a pact is someone saying yes to

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Or if it's two alternate timelines and they somehow got

**Tyram:** it. Man, I hope not because

**Ellis Taylor:** smooshed. She said

**Tyram:** that's just a whole other kettle of fish.

**Ellis Taylor:** yes and no at the same time. It's Helana's cat. Lily Helana's cat.

**Luke Neverisky:** She does not. Is it the

**Justin Hale:** No, no,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I was going to start asking you like a lot of like few questions just to try and see if you have any negative feelings like if we were

**Justin Hale:** no.

**Ellis Taylor:** split into like positive and negative, but if you don't know, no point asking all the questions. And I have no idea how to talk to

**Luke Neverisky:** time Listen, she she's

**Ellis Taylor:** Tier.

**Luke Neverisky:** just a normal person trying to live her

**Tyram:** I I just mostly

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** want to know like is what should we kill Helisana or try to like create like a should we try to heal your soul here and like get you guys back together? Like I don't I don't know what um our objective should be

**Ellis Taylor:** I don't

**Luke Neverisky:** life.

**Justin Hale:** That one sounds more

**Ellis Taylor:** either. I feel

**Luke Neverisky:** Maybe something

**Justin Hale:** complicated.

**Ellis Taylor:** like we might just have to I feel ultimately we might just have to like concede the city to Helisana and let her let her party it up while we try and figure out how to fix the fabric and then we can come back and

**Justin Hale:** Would

**Ellis Taylor:** fuse them back together or

**Justin Hale:** she would she potentially like burn herself

**Tyram:** here.

**Luke Neverisky:** over. He does like

**Ellis Taylor:** something. It is a mortal body.

**Luke Neverisky:** drugs.

**Tyram:** But don't the ravers want to like go on a killing spree? I don't think they would just

**Ellis Taylor:** It's

**Justin Hale:** out?

**Tyram:** like passively sit around and party the whole time. I think they'd like commit

**Ellis Taylor:** a what? I don't remember that. Something like

**Tyram:** genocide at when Helisana did the concert at Little Havvel. Um, it seemed like the deity was pushing her to go on a killing spree,

**Luke Neverisky:** That is true. That is

**Justin Hale:** Oh, and now it's

**Tyram:** unless I'm remembering incorrectly.

**Ellis Taylor:** that.

**Justin Hale:** unfettered access to that thought process. That's a good

**Ali Leonard:** He

**Christopher Hooper:** So, so

**Ali Leonard:** did just make her like attack

**Tyram:** I don't know that just

**Christopher Hooper:** Liliana was there.

**Tyram:** leaving Helisana in charge of the city is a consionable

**Luke Neverisky:** true.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, Liliana, you would probably know that they were directing you to attack your own party, not just

**Tyram:** choice.

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. Yeah, they went specifically after or attempted

**Justin Hale:** point.

**Christopher Hooper:** anyone.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** to. So, not

**Christopher Hooper:** of its presence. Um,

**Justin Hale:** Hey

**Christopher Hooper:** echuk um are are of it like like

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** kind of I I feel like there's a story of like I think in Belgium there was this um like month where this town like parted

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** itself to death. Um and uh basically those are the types of stories

**Ellis Taylor:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** that you heard related to echuk is that um it like it kind of like burns itself out once it runs out of like

**Justin Hale:** So they

**Christopher Hooper:** gas.

**Ellis Taylor:** so they'll stay here and party themselves to

**Justin Hale:** cut off the

**Ellis Taylor:** death

**Justin Hale:** gas. Well, he's he spreads like weed.

**Ellis Taylor:** hopefully.

**Justin Hale:** Is there a way to uh like trap Rave? doing trap rave and helis sana

**Ellis Taylor:** What happened to that

**Justin Hale:** in chucky chuck cheese in

**Ali Leonard:** in the

**Ellis Taylor:** pocket dimension we were working

**Justin Hale:** in like like a bubble kept them all

**Ali Leonard:** Charles Entertainment

**Justin Hale:** in a bubble and they parted themselves out and then they just

**Ellis Taylor:** on?

**Luke Neverisky:** I mean, I was trapped somewhere, But I'm

**Justin Hale:** slowly burn

**Ali Leonard:** Cheese.

**Luke Neverisky:** pretty sure that was within, you

**Ali Leonard:** Right. So, if

**Justin Hale:** out.

**Ali Leonard:** Helisan is the conduit, it all goes through

**Luke Neverisky:** know,


### [03:10:00]

**Ali Leonard:** her. Can we just knock her out? That's like why I'm going back to like the if we keep her

**Ellis Taylor:** Whatever happened to that pocket dimension we were working on? Like not pocket spa.

**Ali Leonard:** unconscious. Yeah, we're still working on

**Tyram:** I think we

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Can we just throw her in

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** have like five weeks of rolls that we still

**Ellis Taylor:** that?

**Justin Hale:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We're We're

**Ali Leonard:** I'm trying to lower

**Tyram:** need to resolve. Oh, wait. You guys are doing that on like a thread,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** not very good. We're not

**Ali Leonard:** the AC so that I can help with

**Tyram:** right?

**Justin Hale:** very good about remembering to do it so much that the thread has

**Ali Leonard:** the and I wanted the girl at home with the van lowering the AC so that I can also then help

**Justin Hale:** disappeared.

**Luke Neverisky:** You mean it's over?

**Justin Hale:** Why don't you want to talk to us,

**Christopher Hooper:** And people like Helisonic can give you bic inspiration and things like

**Ali Leonard:** I don't know who that

**Christopher Hooper:** that. Yeah. Do

**Tyram:** Then Liliana, give us inspiration. I'd still like to know if you have like

**Ellis Taylor:** Have we leveled up

**Tyram:** character levels at this

**Ellis Taylor:** in a while? Probably

**Justin Hale:** man?

**Christopher Hooper:** you? Well, after

**Ali Leonard:** is.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Well, oh snap.

**Christopher Hooper:** tonight, you're level eight. You can level up to level

**Ellis Taylor:** not. Oh my gosh.

**Ali Leonard:** or level six and a level one and a level

**Tyram:** point. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** So,

**Justin Hale:** You're just going to be 20 level

**Christopher Hooper:** eight.

**Tyram:** cool.

**Justin Hale:** ones. Please.

**Ali Leonard:** one. I'm

**Tyram:** Oh my. Are you actually like doing a cleric level or

**Ali Leonard:** debating

**Tyram:** something? I don't think a cleric at that low level is going to do anything more for you than another level in Paladin is going to

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, you went

**Ali Leonard:** it. I don't know. Yeah, you

**Ellis Taylor:** paladin.

**Luke Neverisky:** oh,

**Ali Leonard:** inspired me, but now I'm regretting it.

**Tyram:** do. Uh, paladins heal just as well as clerics at

**Ali Leonard:** I haven't found my god. He doesn't talk to

**Tyram:** low levels.

**Ellis Taylor:** You don't want tear. Oh honey, you're not sticking with the family

**Justin Hale:** You can pray the turtle

**Ali Leonard:** me. No, the sheep god told

**Justin Hale:** guy. His shell is big

**Ali Leonard:** me to find this mechanic god. And now I'm thinking the sheep god doesn't know what

**Luke Neverisky:** This

**Justin Hale:** enough. Listen, we don't talk about

**Ali Leonard:** the f*** she was talking about.

**Ellis Taylor:** business.

**Luke Neverisky:** isn't all

**Justin Hale:** the sheep. All sheep are murderers. Remember remember this murder sheep at they

**Ali Leonard:** You have a harum of sheeps. What are you talking

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Justin Hale:** will murder you in your sleep. You want you want

**Ellis Taylor:** All

**Justin Hale:** to boop the nose? Do you want to boop the

**Ali Leonard:** about? No, but the one I was talking to

**Justin Hale:** nose?

**Ali Leonard:** didn't try and murder me. Unless this God is going to try

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Well,

**Ali Leonard:** and murder me if he ever talks to

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. All right. Well, I think that's as good of a

**Ali Leonard:** me.

**Justin Hale:** probably

**Christopher Hooper:** stopping point as any um as y'all

**Luke Neverisky:** Uhhuh.

**Christopher Hooper:** um try to figure out what to do

**Ellis Taylor:** right.

**Luke Neverisky:** Uhhuh.

**Christopher Hooper:** next and we we can pick out from there. I hope y'all had some

**Luke Neverisky:** Uhhuh.

**Justin Hale:** I think I think you had the fun

**Christopher Hooper:** fun. At least I did.

**Justin Hale:** tonight

**Christopher Hooper:** I had some fun.

**Ellis Taylor:** I have fun despite my

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** clearly.

**Ellis Taylor:** complaining about I was more just like trying to explain in very little words to to keep what was going on.

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Ellis Taylor:** They're getting our asses

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, uh, Luke and I have been working on this for a few

**Ellis Taylor:** kicked. Yeah, this is

**Justin Hale:** great.

**Christopher Hooper:** weeks, so I'm I was pretty happy with how it came

**Luke Neverisky:** Um um yeah, nice work though. Um yeah,

**Justin Hale:** Nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Luke Neverisky:** Liliana is a level eight straight bard. Uh she's in the College of

**Tyram:** Okay, that kind that makes sense if like Liliana is the bard part of you

**Luke Neverisky:** Glamour. And she

**Tyram:** and Helisan is the warlock part of

**Ellis Taylor:** awesome. All

**Luke Neverisky:** is definitely s

**Justin Hale:** Nice. Hey, can

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Justin Hale:** artificers change their specialist or no

**Ellis Taylor:** right, guys. I have

**Justin Hale:** special

**Tyram:** you. your subclass.

**Ellis Taylor:** to go. Baby's crying. Having a hard time. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** specialization? Fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** a poor

**Ali Leonard:** God. Can you double class an artifist and get another

**Justin Hale:** No, I liked

**Christopher Hooper:** baby. Okay, later

**Ali Leonard:** subclass?

**Tyram:** No.

**Justin Hale:** I liked the action of Alchemist

**Christopher Hooper:** Ellis.

**Luke Neverisky:** warlocks.

**Tyram:** Okay. Okay. So, we need to figure out a way to figure out whether we are trying to save Helisana or if Helisana is like a pure evil thing that we don't want to

**Luke Neverisky:** It's not looking

**Justin Hale:** though. I said

**Tyram:** save.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, do you uh do you have like um I would say if you want to ask Luke like sort of like meta

**Luke Neverisky:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** like is he going to be pissed if no one cares about Helisana? I don't mind if y'all have that

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** conversation.

**Tyram:** Luke, do you want us to save Helisana?

**Justin Hale:** killer.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. I Yeah. I

**Tyram:** Okay, I guess that's the bottom line

**Ali Leonard:** didn't know if Helisana was like that was the key like we had to say,

**Luke Neverisky:** care. Oh, no. I want a organic decision. Whatever we've decided.

**Ali Leonard:** you know, like

**Luke Neverisky:** Don't do it. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um Mhm. Mhm.

**Tyram:** then. I don't know. Like I think that it's a good story beat if like we like heal your fractured soul if that's what

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Tyram:** this is. But I also think it's a good story beat if we help your

**Ali Leonard:** your badness.

**Tyram:** goodness destroy your badness. If that's what this is.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. I don't know what it is.

**Tyram:** I don't know which this is. is I think either one's a I think either one's a good story,

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** but um I just I don't know what we're what we're aiming for right

**Luke Neverisky:** Sammy,

**Ali Leonard:** But we always make we all make mistakes. So either

**Christopher Hooper:** I I I I feel like and and Luke can chime in too,

**Ali Leonard:** one, it'll be

**Christopher Hooper:** but I feel like all of this is on the board. So, just like purely do like what y'all want to like do in character and stuff

**Luke Neverisky:** what's Yeah, I feel Like

**Christopher Hooper:** like um Yeah.

**Tyram:** now.

**Luke Neverisky:** I feel like maybe at the risk of sounding le like

**Ali Leonard:** fun.

**Luke Neverisky:** we can punt this decision kind of right as far as like what the ultimate like what you know kill versus save quoteunquote like we still have other things to do that and maybe we'll uh maybe we'll get a glimpse as to actually what the state

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I know Elizabeth would lead would lean toward safe without knowing if we don't have the information. She would lead towards

**Justin Hale:** Brew already rolled that chaos die. He doesn't care if Elisa

**Ali Leonard:** safe. He does not give a s***. That is an employer. That's a business

**Justin Hale:** lives. I mean, it doesn't make it doesn't make sense to his brain. He's like, "There's the

**Ali Leonard:** relationship.

**Justin Hale:** one that was trapped. Kill the bad one." Pretty pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** black and white.

**Ali Leonard:** I think that's the issue Elizabeth has is like but Helisana is my

**Tyram:** I'm torn.

**Justin Hale:** Damn.

**Tyram:** So, I'm torn because I think it's good character development for Silus to care about his friends, but it's also true that Helisana at no point acted like

**Luke Neverisky:** She did call you guys

**Ali Leonard:** friend right exactly exactly and

**Tyram:** our friends.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** that's also what I'm wrestling Cuz Elizabeth

**Luke Neverisky:** coworkers. Yeah,

**Ali Leonard:** for sure thought they were friends. And now she's like, "Wait, were we

**Luke Neverisky:** I feel real bad when like you had Elizabeth like try to protect things like

**Ali Leonard:** friends?"

**Tyram:** Yes. Well, that's why

**Justin Hale:** Correct.

**Ali Leonard:** And you're like, "I don't give a s*** if you live or die. Yep.

**Tyram:** I was trying to ask like Liliana if that's what I was trying to ask Liliana if like Helisana did in fact think of us as friends or not because I feel like the answer to that question is basically

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Tyram:** the way I want to go. Like if Helisana, there's a part of Helisana that did have a genuine connection of camaraderie with the group. I want to try to save Helasana. But if Helisana really is just a completely selfish

**Luke Neverisky:** So I mean

**Tyram:** uh bastion of evil, then yeah, let's f****** kill

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah Lilia wouldn't know that have access to her thoughts protot. poker. So, all I

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** her.

**Luke Neverisky:** can Yeah. I mean, as far as the former player

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** of her, um I will say that uh fame was most important above all

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. And I'm kind of realizing that and like think

**Justin Hale:** retrospect.

**Ali Leonard:** back to like

**Tyram:** Okay. So, we could play

**Luke Neverisky:** else.

**Tyram:** this as we are vanquishing the dark part of you that has been severed from your soul. or I don't know if we decide we wanted to like reunite your

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Tyram:** two halves and like make you a whole person. Either one of those is a good

**Ali Leonard:** situations.

**Tyram:** story, you know, like I said. So, you know, it's whatever. I'll be I'll be down with whatever the group

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, we can zone of truth her and see if we were her

**Tyram:** decides. Oh, yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** friends. And if we weren't, then she

**Tyram:** Actually, I kind of like

**Luke Neverisky:** right. It's

**Ali Leonard:** dies. That's it. And that can be you can kill her if you

**Tyram:** that. You're either one of our friends or you're f****** dead to us.

**Luke Neverisky:** true.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Ali Leonard:** want. Have your death fireworks

**Christopher Hooper:** man. I uh I know the battles

**Ali Leonard:** ready.

**Christopher Hooper:** seem bleak, but the fact that like Silas with one intelligence point like hit the panel like with like I think you you only exceeded it by like three hit points your

**Ali Leonard:** Oh my

**Tyram:** Okay. Because I I rolled

**Christopher Hooper:** hit. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** god.

**Tyram:** really well on that sneak attack damage. Like way better than I normally do. So

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** that was that really was a uh a pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, it it was like I was so

**Tyram:** uh make orb break moment

**Justin Hale:** battles.

**Christopher Hooper:** worried you were going to like miss with your second attack and like oh no

**Tyram:** there. Well, I do I do get the advantage from any

**Christopher Hooper:** like the heck. Yeah. Yeah. I was like,

**Tyram:** anytime I hit I give myself advantage which is pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** "Okay, like this should be fine." Like, but like holy s***, if you had rolled bad, especially the first roll, right? If you had missed or something like that, like with

**Tyram:** useful. If I had missed on that first attack, which Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** Battles that

**Christopher Hooper:** me.

**Tyram:** that that would have been f******

**Justin Hale:** we coast through are boring. Like when there's when there's that element of danger, it makes it more interesting like for for every turn. Like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** when battles aren't hard, it's really only interesting on your turn,

**Tyram:** garbage.

**Justin Hale:** you know?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I mean, that's

**Justin Hale:** There's just no


### [03:20:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** like I was like I was like, "Y'all are coasting through this and y'all are going to die." I think I think y'all are used to battles like coasting. I need to make sure y'all know that if you do that

**Justin Hale:** risk.

**Christopher Hooper:** and don't focus. This could go badly. And then once you did, it was like

**Tyram:** I was trying to focus on crank, but

**Christopher Hooper:** straightforward.

**Ali Leonard:** We

**Tyram:** like circumstances kind of made my targets made the choice of my targets for me because once I'm blind, I don't know where the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** were like we were focused but all

**Tyram:** f*** Crank is anymore. I don't know where the goddamn speakers are, you know?

**Justin Hale:** Well, my

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** on the wrong like all on separate

**Justin Hale:** my initial focus was crowd control. Like that's usually my priority is

**Ali Leonard:** stuff.

**Justin Hale:** crowd control so that you guys can like go in for the kill. And then

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** that fell apart

**Tyram:** Well, Crang was basically

**Justin Hale:** quickly.

**Tyram:** immune because of their like stupid high saves to like all of your

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. And then when Crang was like on top of me, it was like, well, f***. What do I do

**Tyram:** s***.

**Justin Hale:** now? And then when the when the party like shifted, it was like, "Okay, I don't know what we're doing anymore." Because like that's usually

**Tyram:** Well, the thing that made it feel like really hopeless to me was like

**Justin Hale:** my

**Tyram:** not knowing that the speakers ended the fight. Um, it seemed like even if we take out the speakers, which are definitely bad news, Crang is doing 50 f****** damage basically automatically every single turn.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** And they will kill us, you

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I need to respspec

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** know.

**Justin Hale:** my spells because I need more like crowd control stuff.

**Christopher Hooper:** So,

**Justin Hale:** Kind of what I want for geared

**Christopher Hooper:** um something that so the like mobs are using the um like the horror mechanic from flea mortals. So, you should know like things like shatter and stuff like AoE type

**Justin Hale:** towards.

**Christopher Hooper:** stuff is like very effective against those. Um, and if

**Justin Hale:** Okay, that's good to know.

**Christopher Hooper:** you're and and like single hit like high damage is a a lot less effective, but you can do like basically you're if you if you hit them, you'll definitely kill one, but you're hoping to kill

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** like more than one at least with every hit basically.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I need to go back through for

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so that's like a good thing to know. Uh, when you

**Justin Hale:** sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** see any like enemy like that is like try to you're trying to kill like many of them like per turn

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, I'm going to go ahead and uh and bow out here, but yeah, have fun everybody. I'll see you guys

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** basically. Thanks. See you

**Tyram:** uh next week.

**Justin Hale:** Bye. Bye.

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor. Thanks all.
