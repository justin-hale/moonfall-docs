**Ellis Taylor:** I really want to do a secret tunnel episode,

**Tyram:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** mean?

**Tyram:** Oh, okay. Blue ox. I

**Ellis Taylor:** What was that scene? Ah, shoot.

**Tyram:** didn't

**Ali Leonard:** Of course he

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, they do like 10 product placements within like five minutes. The

**Justin Hale:** Wayne's

**Ellis Taylor:** entire Wayne's World. That's what it was.

**Justin Hale:** world.

**Tyram:** I can just picture

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Tyram:** a blue ox logo, too. That's really

**Justin Hale:** Mhm. Sun bills and blue


### [00:40:00]

**Ali Leonard:** did. So

**Justin Hale:** locks.

**Ali Leonard:** the race is in 24 hours. You have until

**Luke Neverisky:** yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** great.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, do I I I hate to even ask, but

**Tyram:** Well, murder

**Walden Briarhelm:** does anybody have any

**Tyram:** is off the table apparently. Jeez. Well, it

**Ali Leonard:** then. Yeah, I shouldn't have to say

**Walden Briarhelm:** suggestions? Yeah. I don't I I don't know

**Tyram:** helps when you

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** why we All right. So, we got to

**Tyram:** clarify.

**Ali Leonard:** We want

**Walden Briarhelm:** we got to really make sure we're detailed here.

**Ellis Taylor:** It's

**Ali Leonard:** her disgraced. We want her out of the circuit. We want her disgraced and out of

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Justin Hale:** What was the

**Ali Leonard:** here and not be able to come back.

**Walden Briarhelm:** wonder. Well, let's start

**Ali Leonard:** We

**Walden Briarhelm:** there. We don't know. She was

**Ali Leonard:** need No, I said she

**Walden Briarhelm:** intentionally vague with

**Ali Leonard:** voted against their last um what is it called when you put something to a vote like in the board meeting? She voted

**Ellis Taylor:** What did she vote

**Justin Hale:** reason? But if we all vote against

**Ali Leonard:** against

**Ellis Taylor:** against?

**Justin Hale:** you now, would we all get kicked

**Tyram:** I I guess I would

**Ali Leonard:** it. Ask your team

**Justin Hale:** out?

**Tyram:** know, right?

**Ali Leonard:** owner. Yeah, you would know. So, I guess I if you want to release that information, I can release

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** it. If you would release the information, I can release it for

**Tyram:** I'd like to know what the information is. Like me, Taylor would like to know

**Ali Leonard:** you. I'll send it to

**Tyram:** before Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, what's

**Tyram:** Yeah, be one

**Walden Briarhelm:** the most disgraceful thing you can do in racing other than

**Tyram:** of you losers.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** sabotage your friend. Well, I can't say I'm a big fan

**Tyram:** Obviously, he was

**Walden Briarhelm:** of these jokes, but I I do consider it

**Ellis Taylor:** Jackson carefully over.

**Christopher Hooper:** Good morning. Good

**Tyram:** joking.

**Walden Briarhelm:** funny. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** night. All right. Can you Can you help me? So, we

**Walden Briarhelm:** a super happy smile.

**Christopher Hooper:** are an orc woman and we have to decide how to kill Elsa. What should we

**Ali Leonard:** kill.

**Christopher Hooper:** do? What do you think we should

**Tyram:** We were

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, no, not not

**Christopher Hooper:** do? Should

**Tyram:** explicitly told not to kill

**Ali Leonard:** me.

**Walden Briarhelm:** kill. No. M murder is off the

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we just have to disgrace

**Christopher Hooper:** we throw them in the ocean? Oh, we just

**Tyram:** her.

**Ellis Taylor:** her.

**Christopher Hooper:** have to make her really sad. What do you think would make her sad?

**Tyram:** That'd be a real twist if like the Ellswith we've

**Christopher Hooper:** How

**Tyram:** known this whole time was like stepping into murdered El

**Christopher Hooper:** about Oh, we can make them alive. That would

**Tyram:** Smith's identity

**Walden Briarhelm:** What

**Christopher Hooper:** make them really

**Walden Briarhelm:** if what if we just did something that

**Christopher Hooper:** sad.

**Walden Briarhelm:** would ruin her reputation and not harm her? I have this idea. What if

**Tyram:** somehow.

**Walden Briarhelm:** we just, I don't know, knocked her out and tattooed a something real racer on her face and then she wouldn't be able to be in the spotlight. Nobody would want to see her anymore with such

**Ellis Taylor:** Every

**Walden Briarhelm:** horrific markings and hate all over her face. Like, that's a an option that isn't terrible, but I hate every option right

**Tyram:** as if we could make her face look any

**Walden Briarhelm:** now. You always got

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, the

**Tyram:** worse.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a good

**Ellis Taylor:** obvious answer is a cheating scandal.

**Walden Briarhelm:** one.

**Ellis Taylor:** We somehow frame her What? Oh my

**Walden Briarhelm:** Who's going to sleep over

**Ellis Taylor:** good. My dude, we frame her for like rigging a race or

**Ali Leonard:** Fix.

**Walden Briarhelm:** there? Well, how

**Ellis Taylor:** something. Oh my god.

**Walden Briarhelm:** do we do that? I've never cheated in a race.

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, I don't know. And my dad was of no help to this

**Justin Hale:** I feel like my sponsors are not going to be very happy about

**Christopher Hooper:** Espionage.

**Luke Neverisky:** whatsoever.

**Tyram:** I'm so conflicted because part of me is

**Justin Hale:** this.

**Tyram:** annoyed by all this centrifuge and hassle, but a part of me

**Walden Briarhelm:** F.

**Tyram:** is also thrilled by the minations of it all.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. So, that's a little map

**Luke Neverisky:** Look at

**Ali Leonard:** of where you're at right now. That's not the raceourse, obviously. So, right now, you're in the Pigota. All your cars are in the garages A, B, and C. And that's where they're working on everybody's

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** cars. And then Pit Road is to the south. And then all of your tents and where you guys all hang out for the week leading up to the race is to the north like right above the east Shelly that green grass

**Christopher Hooper:** What is a What is the IOU health. It's the health tent. Indiana University health

**Tyram:** Why is it Indiana University? I was

**Ali Leonard:** area because

**Christopher Hooper:** tent.

**Tyram:** wondering. Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** it's the Indianapolis Speedway.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Tyram:** okay. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** way. That's my favorite layout of the of

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, that makes sense.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, is there really a pigota there? Okay. I was

**Ali Leonard:** the garages that I've been to.

**Christopher Hooper:** wondering why there was a pig.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, it's Yeah, it's like huge and only media and famous people get to be in

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So, this is this meeting adjourned then Zor is going to go

**Ali Leonard:** it. Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** to the handicap parking space where her dad is parked and

**Ali Leonard:** absolutely.

**Christopher Hooper:** going to help him out of his car and and bring her back to bring them back to the uh Sarkc garage.

**Ali Leonard:** He's like, "Okay, everybody else. Yeah, get out of my office. Figure it

**Ellis Taylor:** Where are they

**Tyram:** Oh, were we still in the office? Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** out." Yeah. f*** off.

**Ellis Taylor:** going.

**Tyram:** okay.

**Ali Leonard:** So you guys can do this together. You guys can do it separately.

**Tyram:** Okay. So, all of us frame Ellswith for

**Ali Leonard:** However you guys

**Tyram:** uh cheating, it sounds

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh Mhm. Uh six wave frame.

**Tyram:** like. So, is this going to turn like the rest of the campaign for Ellswith is going to be like a kill

**Ali Leonard:** want to none of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Tyram:** Bill style like revenge

**Ali Leonard:** you. It's whatever it takes.

**Ellis Taylor:** You're supposed

**Justin Hale:** uh it's going to be Scott Pilgrim versus the world. She

**Tyram:** spree?

**Ali Leonard:** You know, if you can't get it

**Ellis Taylor:** to

**Justin Hale:** has to take on the the nine boyfriends or

**Tyram:** Ellsworth

**Ali Leonard:** done, you have to

**Ellis Taylor:** be It's what is

**Tyram:** versus the

**Walden Briarhelm:** that

**Ellis Taylor:** it? Two, four, six evil

**Justin Hale:** whatever.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um I think once Zugor is at the garage area, she is going to get on a scooter and head over to

**Tyram:** racists.

**Ali Leonard:** get

**Christopher Hooper:** um the uh Cooper garage and

**Ali Leonard:** absolutely

**Ellis Taylor:** races.

**Christopher Hooper:** attempt to make small talk while scoping out their

**Ellis Taylor:** on that same

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm. Okay. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** thread. Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** You get over there. No, you I'll look up a photo of what the

**Ellis Taylor:** sorry. On that same thread, Serge was I was going to have Serge try and

**Christopher Hooper:** setup.

**Ali Leonard:** garage looks like. You

**Ellis Taylor:** find Zachary. So, if he's in the same place or not.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** go. Yeah. He would be in the Cooper

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** garage. Let's see. Indie, Indie, Indie, April,

**Ellis Taylor:** What's she

**Tyram:** I think I think Denlin would try to

**Ali Leonard:** May. When was I

**Ellis Taylor:** doing?

**Tyram:** like think of a bunch of like dick dastardly style wacky racer traps that are not going to work but are going to be like really elastic. and

**Ellis Taylor:** of death trying to kill

**Ali Leonard:** there? That's the museum. Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** us. What did you do?

**Tyram:** flamboyant. All right. So, Denlin heads back to his uh his personal suite and it probably like kicks a dog while he's like walking in that direction. And um yeah, he's going to go like just kind of create a bunch of like really stupid

**Ali Leonard:** poopy. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** Um,

**Ali Leonard:** So, yeah, I have two people at the Cooper garage, one at their own

**Justin Hale:** oh, I'm definitely going back to my garage and I'm going to talk to all of my uh sponsor appointed nerds and get them to

**Tyram:** traps.

**Justin Hale:** do the work for me.

**Ali Leonard:** garage.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm curious for lore reasons and also lack of real life knowledge. What are all the various ways you can cheat in race car driving typically, but specifically in this

**Ali Leonard:** You can do a weight

**Walden Briarhelm:** world?

**Ali Leonard:** reduction. So, if the car isn't the same weight as when it was on the track as it was off the track, you can add fins to either make it faster or slow it down. You can always add something to like clog a tail pipe, clog something, give them a bad spark plug. You can do something with their crystal because every car has

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** crystal. There's a lot of different things you could do. You could do something magic wise that it's temporary. You could do something to Elizabeth

**Justin Hale:** She's not here,

**Ali Leonard:** herself. She's not in

**Justin Hale:** man.

**Ali Leonard:** a meeting, but she's


### [00:50:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** going to say Scotty Mack is back at his garage. No, no, no. He's sitting in like the driver's seat of the truck they use to haul the race car around and he's just kind of zoning out like that old man trying to contemplate what he's supposed to do right now in a hard situation. and uh he's kind of running through the ideas of

**Ali Leonard:** somewhere

**Walden Briarhelm:** what what could actually get someone caught up enough in a cheating scandal without really doing anything too horrible. And uh he's kind of gripping the wheel of the truck and just lost in thought. But he is back at his garage

**Christopher Hooper:** So, uh, so Zuber is scoping out the

**Walden Briarhelm:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cooper garage. Did you were you gonna pull up a picture of

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I was saying where

**Christopher Hooper:** that? Okay, gotcha. Gotcha.

**Ali Leonard:** everybody else if because if there's two people at Cooper then I was going to do that. But so you kind of see each other. You and Serge Serge see each other and in front of every garage because it's the day before the race which is weirdly named carb day which is carburetor day. There are fans out and they get to look in the garages. So there are it's like taped off so you can only like look over but you can get the attention of their team lead or their team engineer.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ali Leonard:** Somebody's working on the

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. I'm gonna Zor is going to stand in front of the car or in front of the tape looking in for a little for a little period and then

**Ali Leonard:** car.

**Christopher Hooper:** say very uh clearly

**Ali Leonard:** and their engineer that's like working on like the tires like uh hey Zuger excuse

**Christopher Hooper:** broken. She points at um one of the axle connections um in the front of the car in the way is like tied to the to the chases

**Ali Leonard:** me

**Christopher Hooper:** says broken a

**Ali Leonard:** Are

**Christopher Hooper:** show. It is

**Ali Leonard:** you think it's broken? You want to show me? I mean, you can show me. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** broken. Um and her her dad's

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, come on

**Christopher Hooper:** right behind her. Um, and she is leaning down and um, can I

**Ali Leonard:** in.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, so my my thinking here is that Suber is also very technically adept and

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** she she's going to try to like outsmart like no like she knows it so much to to be like convince them that something is broken that's like not really broken. Um he's going to say but she's going

**Ali Leonard:** absolutely. Okay. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** to start like pointing at various lines and say this here and start like trying to move stuff um and uh work on the axle. Uh meanwhile, um her dad is going to start um is going to be down in there and very carefully start filing um the uh floor of the car to make it thinner and

**Ali Leonard:** like so

**Christopher Hooper:** lighter.

**Ali Leonard:** here. Let me send that picture just so that I know where he's at because it's very open. How do I add a picture? I'm like

**Justin Hale:** You already added a picture,

**Ali Leonard:** 90 years old.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** Grandma.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay, so that's like the garage door and then the tape is right there and then there's like people working on it on each

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. Right. So, they're on one of those like back corners. Um, Zuger, her

**Ali Leonard:** side. seeker and

**Christopher Hooper:** dad, and this other engineer and like

**Ali Leonard:** the

**Christopher Hooper:** she is like doing stuff with him and basically running like a loop of like taking things apart and then refixing them and actually like maybe making some improvements if she actually sees them while but as a smoke screen while her dad tries to file

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** down.

**Ali Leonard:** like, okay, do you want to do a

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Oh, yeah. For

**Ali Leonard:** slight of hand for

**Christopher Hooper:** sure. Um, let's see. So, her dad is a ex like um KGB

**Ali Leonard:** me?

**Christopher Hooper:** type. I I'll

**Justin Hale:** So, man, this family

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. Sure he

**Christopher Hooper:** just I'll I'm just

**Justin Hale:** stacks, bro.

**Ali Leonard:** is. And he knows about cars and where to file it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Obviously. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** going to roll a d20 and you can tell me what kind of massive bonuses

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah. I love

**Christopher Hooper:** to do. Um, so,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I think it's a plus 10 or a plus

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** so like eight on the dice and eight is on the dice, but

**Justin Hale:** 15. So, it's like a 28,

**Luke Neverisky:** Great. But it's like a plus 50,

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. Yeah, but he is uh he he is

**Ali Leonard:** I'll give you advantage because they're being

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Yeah, I think I and because of his skill, I think he has

**Justin Hale:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** a feature. Okay. So,

**Justin Hale:** Can

**Ali Leonard:** distracted and because

**Christopher Hooper:** the the second roll was a six.

**Justin Hale:** I can I help? No,

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. You're not

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Justin Hale:** I wanted So, my idea was to have Sunbill's uh Sunbills appointees and Blue Oox appointees come over and offer contracts to the pit crew and the engineers to come work for uh the MX team.

**Ali Leonard:** there. Damn, y'all are

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Justin Hale:** This is your story,

**Ali Leonard:** being mean.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, the second roll was a

**Ali Leonard:** What was the second rule?

**Christopher Hooper:** six, but that's without bonuses.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. So, worse, right? Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Plus

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** So, let me see if the team engineer sees

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** anything cuz I mean he's very high

**Christopher Hooper:** While you while you're doing that, I'll give you some background on if this is

**Justin Hale:** bro.

**Ali Leonard:** up. He's very knowledgeable. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** dad. Um, so X like equivalent KGB of like

**Ali Leonard:** Uhhuh.

**Luke Neverisky:** 15.

**Christopher Hooper:** the, you know, previous like resistance than then the

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** U. So he's like pretty he's he's handy.

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, like he's not frail. Um,

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** and he always carries the a file that with him, of

**Ali Leonard:** Right. Sure. I was going

**Christopher Hooper:** course. Yeah, I think

**Ali Leonard:** to Sure. I was going to give you a plus

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** that's that's accurate.

**Ali Leonard:** 10. The engineer did roll a

**Luke Neverisky:** sorry.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** 19. So he did see it and he is very

**Christopher Hooper:** close. Uh,

**Ali Leonard:** pissed.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. What am I doing? What is this? What does the engineer

**Ali Leonard:** What are you

**Christopher Hooper:** say when like how do they show that they they notice?

**Tyram:** Yeah, I was about to

**Ali Leonard:** doing to the dad? He goes, "What are you

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Ali Leonard:** doing?" Yeah. The not me,

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, Zuber's dad says,

**Tyram:** the

**Ali Leonard:** the engineer.

**Christopher Hooper:** "Oh, goodness me. What is this little piece right

**Ali Leonard:** too. You'll be lucky if we don't report

**Christopher Hooper:** What? I I

**Ali Leonard:** you for

**Christopher Hooper:** fix.

**Ali Leonard:** tampering. Get Get out. And then they closed the garage

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. I

**Ali Leonard:** doors. Now they have to get the whole chassis

**Christopher Hooper:** fix uh they um they

**Ali Leonard:** again. Good thing they have extra

**Christopher Hooper:** walk back and and talk between themselves about their next

**Ali Leonard:** parts.

**Christopher Hooper:** plan.

**Tyram:** Do any of us know where Ellsworth is right

**Ali Leonard:** Um, Scotty Mac might, but she's probably up in her either in her tent or like up in cuz each

**Justin Hale:** Did you say who's the

**Tyram:** now?

**Ali Leonard:** garage has like a

**Justin Hale:** closest to El Smith like in as a in a friendship?

**Ali Leonard:** bathroom. Scotty Mac.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So,

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** um, Scotty's been thinking and he's got

**Ali Leonard:** And it

**Walden Briarhelm:** an idea. He's he got out of the truck and, you know, he walked over to one of the tool boxes and just kind of was opening and closing them. He's really just not liking this, but

**Ali Leonard:** struck.

**Walden Briarhelm:** he's come up with an idea.

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** He He has this concept where maybe if he put like a rune under the car that he could activate, it would make the car fly for a short period of time. And that

**Ali Leonard:** But it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** is very much cheating in a race. And that could be the the final final thing. Like nobody else would know this, but like he has one in his toolbox and that's why he keeps playing with the drawers. He could just slip it under the

**Ali Leonard:** cheating.

**Walden Briarhelm:** car and he would it would look like he's just looking at it. Scotty's a trusted guy, but would be like if everybody else somehow

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Walden Briarhelm:** failed with all their antics.

**Ali Leonard:** Last

**Walden Briarhelm:** Scotty would be willing to be like, "We're going to I have to do this. It's like the end

**Ali Leonard:** second. Sure. Back pocket.

**Walden Briarhelm:** of Armageddon for him. Uh, he's got a he's got a blow the detonator kind of thing. Uh, from what I can tell looking at D&D rules, it's a penant of the vin

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Walden Briarhelm:** rune scribed uh with the

**Ali Leonard:** I'm just saying that.


### [01:00:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** windstep property and you should be able to then scribe it on the vehicle to keep, you know, just keep it D and D. Uh, the remote triggering I think is kind of for funsies though. I don't think it would work like that. Uh but

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh you know out of interest, Scotty uh he does go to see El Smith if she's available. Is she where you were

**Ali Leonard:** You can knock on the

**Walden Briarhelm:** suggesting in the back of the

**Ali Leonard:** door. Um, they're kind of closed to everyone right now because of the sabotage. So they're kind of closing ranks a little

**Walden Briarhelm:** garages? Sure. Got it. All right.

**Ali Leonard:** bit. You could call her on your Yeah, you could

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, may I knock on the

**Christopher Hooper:** At what point do they realize Zugar

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** to commit fully to destroying Elb's career.

**Justin Hale:** Damn,

**Tyram:** apparently. And now I wonder if her brother was like the ultimate culprit here and that's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I think I think I think in her I think Ally

**Justin Hale:** cold. Oh, she's back. She's back.

Uh, so mess with the pit lights or something that makes it dangerous and like induces an unsafe release or something like that. Um,

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** but she's really not sure if that's a good idea or not. And she is praying to her God about it. And God can say it's wheel, woe, will and woe or indifferent. Wheel being good, bad, good and bad, or neither good nor

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** too.

**Ali Leonard:** my token things at the bottom. They piss me

**Walden Briarhelm:** great.

**Ellis Taylor:** how do I make everyone's icon smaller so I can actually see the

**Tyram:** Hold on. Someone's mastering the

**Ali Leonard:** off.

**Ellis Taylor:** map? What's

**Christopher Hooper:** You can go to the gear

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's what I'm trying to figure

**Luke Neverisky:** on the

**Christopher Hooper:** and then go to audio biddy. No, what is

**Luke Neverisky:** gear. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** it? This audio video and then you go

**Luke Neverisky:** Audio video.

**Christopher Hooper:** to video display and then you go to player video

**Ellis Taylor:** that?

**Christopher Hooper:** avatar size and you select names only.

**Justin Hale:** Intuitive.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. Gear as it's

**Tyram:** engine. Oh my f******

**Ali Leonard:** lagging. Audio

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, well, thank you. That worked. But wow.

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool. Thank

**Ali Leonard:** video.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, it's a couple menus deep for something everybody would want.

**Ali Leonard:** You said audio video and then

**Ellis Taylor:** you.

**Tyram:** god.

**Ali Leonard:** what? Video display

**Justin Hale:** Who who drew this Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** then name things only. A thank god. Okay, perfect. I'm trying to assign

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Ali Leonard:** everybody's token. So, there's a subreddit that's like for

**Ellis Taylor:** carb based D and D

**Ali Leonard:** Um, no. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** didn't

**Ali Leonard:** just people that make um it's people that just like make like like

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** racetracks for

**Christopher Hooper:** interesting. So, it's not even a real

**Ali Leonard:** fun. Like

**Ellis Taylor:** sessions.

**Ali Leonard:** like No, it's just one that somebody made. Okay, I'm gonna I'm making it so that people can touch tokens.

**Christopher Hooper:** one.

**Ali Leonard:** I didn't think about doing that

**Justin Hale:** Interesting.

**Ali Leonard:** earlier. Okay, so I put kind of the rules that I kind of came up with in the

**Christopher Hooper:** Of

**Ali Leonard:** Discord. And I was told that they make

**Christopher Hooper:** by who?

**Ali Leonard:** sense. Wait,

**Ellis Taylor:** Got to roll it. D8.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cuz

**Ali Leonard:** please. So, you could technically do double movement if you don't need to try and pass anyone.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** The red line on the map is where officials can't see you. The blue line is what's called VVS, which in real life is called DRS, which I'm calling Vroom Vroom

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ali Leonard:** system. And it's basically like NS, so you kind of get

**Walden Briarhelm:** What is

**Ellis Taylor:** There's no way we're in the broom v

**Ali Leonard:** a little advantage. Okay, got it. I think that is

**Walden Briarhelm:** this?

**Ali Leonard:** all in the blue area.

**Ellis Taylor:** room. Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** And the red area is

**Ali Leonard:** where officials can't see you. So if you were going to do

**Ellis Taylor:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Tyram:** What the heck?

**Ali Leonard:** something illegal, I would do it

**Justin Hale:** illegal.

**Ali Leonard:** there. Elizabeth

**Ellis Taylor:** So there's passing. So there's you can

**Justin Hale:** What?

**Ali Leonard:** wouldn't.

**Ellis Taylor:** normally do passing as part of your action, but if you're in the vroom vroom area, you can pass and still do

**Ali Leonard:** But

**Ellis Taylor:** movement. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** yeah, it'd be like an extra

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. But a D4 instead of a D8.

**Ali Leonard:** movement be like a little bonus. Well, like

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** so you get two actions. So you would do you get two actions per turn. So you could do movement and a VVS. So you could get a D8 plus a D4 if that makes sense. I don't know if any of this makes sense. And if it doesn't, then I can work on it and we can do it again next

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, so our our mission is to get Ellswith convicted of cheating.

**Ali Leonard:** week. Yeah. and win. You still want to

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** Damn, you can't you can't tell her that

**Ellis Taylor:** Um part of my what am I a paladin the stuff I get advantage on d20

**Ali Leonard:** are.

**Ellis Taylor:** or d20 tests and I could spend a lucky point for advantage or someone rolls against me I could spend a lucky point and give them

**Tyram:** for

**Ali Leonard:** I mean, if everybody's using their character, I don't see

**Ellis Taylor:** disadvantage.

**Ali Leonard:** why

**Christopher Hooper:** Then

**Ali Leonard:** not. Everybody's gonna try and kill

**Walden Briarhelm:** Being really strong just doesn't seem to do

**Ali Leonard:** Ellswith, but we can

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** roll for initiative at least and then decide if we want to play tonight or because it it'll probably go pretty late if we start

**Justin Hale:** I have to be up super early

**Walden Briarhelm:** much.

**Tyram:** Actually, can I can I add a

**Ali Leonard:** movements.

**Walden Briarhelm:** dice

**Tyram:** boost to

**Walden Briarhelm:** be

**Tyram:** it? No, it's supposed to be for skill

**Ali Leonard:** I don't think that's a movement

**Ellis Taylor:** Whoa.

**Tyram:** checks. Um, I guess

**Walden Briarhelm:** awesome?

**Luke Neverisky:** It is because

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I just think it'd be really cool for you to take out

**Luke Neverisky:** fantasy

**Tyram:** not.

**Walden Briarhelm:** commandingly and be like, I told you well I was going to lose or whatever the amazing

**Ali Leonard:** thing.

**Walden Briarhelm:** act

**Tyram:** I got a

**Walden Briarhelm:** is.

**Tyram:** total of seven

**Ali Leonard:** You're with

**Justin Hale:** So your

**Tyram:** actually. All

**Justin Hale:** your passing rule if if after like the first round

**Ali Leonard:** us.

**Justin Hale:** since that's like this the speed order. Do you want to do like a contest

**Tyram:** right.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** for passing if we roll higher than the person in front of us or something? Because I don't know if we're ever going to be adjacent all the

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, that's what I was. So, maybe that's what we need to do since see um we're

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** all learning because I didn't know how this would

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yes. So move passing into

**Ali Leonard:** work. But

**Christopher Hooper:** a resolution

**Justin Hale:** time.

**Ali Leonard:** it's like more than two people. Yeah. If

**Christopher Hooper:** phase.

**Ali Leonard:** you're passing someone, you have to contest

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, like y'all should have contested me when you passed

**Ali Leonard:** it. Yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** This was like from the start though, like it was the

**Ellis Taylor:** How about

**Ali Leonard:** we're learning. We're

**Walden Briarhelm:** takeoff. So like it's always kind of

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I think maybe at the start cuz just cuz it's

**Tyram:** Well, I mean, I feel

**Ali Leonard:** learning.

**Walden Briarhelm:** like it's a mishmash at that point.

**Christopher Hooper:** me.

**Tyram:** like I feel like the passing thing should only come into play when like it's close, right? They all blew the this second group completely out of the water, right? So, I feel like they shouldn't be punished for

**Ali Leonard:** But yeah, if he

**Tyram:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** goes one past first stop and then that would be

**Luke Neverisky:** But maybe

**Ali Leonard:** contested. But like if he's passing

**Luke Neverisky:** uh that like the group up ahead.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** me and Danlin, that's different. But also, you can't pass if it's three wide. So, I

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe maybe just at the end of the

**Justin Hale:** I was more so saying like after

**Ali Leonard:** don't Does any of this make

**Christopher Hooper:** round we'll have a contested uh like a contest if you're in adjacent squares basically. Is that what

**Justin Hale:** the

**Luke Neverisky:** need. Oh, that's true. So, everyone

**Christopher Hooper:** everyone?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, only about Yeah, that could

**Ali Leonard:** sense? So, where you

**Luke Neverisky:** ends

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, like I think everyone just

**Luke Neverisky:** the

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I haven't gone

**Christopher Hooper:** went. So, now we would do like a contest. Yeah. But I don't think it's gonna affect

**Ali Leonard:** end? Yeah. Search to go.

**Ellis Taylor:** yet.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, when you roll two

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool. I got an

**Luke Neverisky:** ones, it's it's going to be

**Ellis Taylor:** 11.

**Christopher Hooper:** anything. Oh s***. She's gonna pass me, isn't she? Damn

**Ali Leonard:** So

**Walden Briarhelm:** That is two

**Ellis Taylor:** There's two

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** fun.

**Ellis Taylor:** ones. Do each C score count as

**Ali Leonard:** damn

**Ellis Taylor:** two? Okay, I got to

**Christopher Hooper:** It counts as

**Ellis Taylor:** count.

**Justin Hale:** Damn.

**Ali Leonard:** one.

**Walden Briarhelm:** ones.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, yeah. So, like right

**Justin Hale:** You're You're

**Walden Briarhelm:** Count

**Ellis Taylor:** now I'm one in front. So, would I do like a

**Christopher Hooper:** one. Damn

**Justin Hale:** one in front of

**Christopher Hooper:** it. So, you're

**Ellis Taylor:** pass? Yeah, I

**Christopher Hooper:** in this like contest, I think, right?

**Tyram:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** guess instead of rolling two, I'd have to

**Tyram:** mean, you're tripping out on heroin, you know. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, we're all just like f***** up right

**Tyram:** Poppy,

**Ali Leonard:** Sorry.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** That's right.

**Justin Hale:** Zuger. I'm strung out,

**Tyram:** but

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Okay. Maybe you have to roll one action and

**Justin Hale:** man.

**Ellis Taylor:** then Yeah, it does. Yeah. Like if you want to make

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. I was just thinking one

**Ellis Taylor:** two. No,

**Ali Leonard:** action would take so

**Ellis Taylor:** no, it makes sense. I'm just trying to think of like if I roll next time, what if I rolled like a one, two, three, four, five, six or seven? Then my second roll would have to be a

**Ali Leonard:** long. Right.

**Ellis Taylor:** pass. But if I rolled like a three, what happens if the next one's like a five and but I don't have that pass action? So like with the second action not really count. Does that make

**Christopher Hooper:** I think I think we're moving passing into a different

**Ellis Taylor:** sense? Are we

**Christopher Hooper:** thing. That's what we were just talking about to resolve it now as like a contested a contest between all the groups of adjacent

**Ellis Taylor:** okay? But not but would I count in

**Christopher Hooper:** drivers.

**Ellis Taylor:** this kind of pileup of Zerg, Ellen? Okay. So, if you're all like touch squares are

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** touching, you have to do a

**Justin Hale:** You never let the squares

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Ellis Taylor:** contest.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Never let it

**Justin Hale:** touch. I'm so

**Christopher Hooper:** happen. Should we just do maybe we'll just do like a

**Justin Hale:** stupid.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** reinitiative. Um, does that make sense? No,

**Justin Hale:** No, I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean within each group and then like realign like

**Ellis Taylor:** No, cuz my initiative is negative one. I don't like

**Justin Hale:** first.

**Walden Briarhelm:** just do it in order of who's

**Ellis Taylor:** that idea at

**Christopher Hooper:** that. Well, you're slow. You're slow

**Walden Briarhelm:** first. Whoa, double

**Christopher Hooper:** at driving. That's the whole

**Justin Hale:** So, what if we after every round, if we're in

**Ellis Taylor:** all.

**Justin Hale:** a group, we do a contested roll and whoever gets the highest number is in the lead and then whoever is in the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that makes

**Justin Hale:** lead, that's the person that rolls first for the next

**Walden Briarhelm:** Luke.

**Christopher Hooper:** Right. So like an a

**Justin Hale:** round. Yeah. But just not actually

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sounds good to

**Luke Neverisky:** sense.

**Christopher Hooper:** reinitiative. Oh, without without the

**Justin Hale:** rolling initiative, just rolling that into the contested

**Christopher Hooper:** modifier basically. Okay. Yeah, we could do that.

**Justin Hale:** role.

**Christopher Hooper:** just a flat d20 roll for each group and then realign

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** into like basically the grid form

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that sounds

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I just want to throw it out there.

**Justin Hale:** good.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. I'm not using that. I'm not

**Walden Briarhelm:** Als driving. Does that apply doing this? Okay. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** using that. No, cuz we're

**Walden Briarhelm:** Just making sure. I was like, cuz that gives you quite the

**Christopher Hooper:** maybe

**Ali Leonard:** all racists. So, I'm

**Walden Briarhelm:** advantage. Yeah. This is an equal group of

**Ali Leonard:** not

**Walden Briarhelm:** racists. I understand. We all We all do racist

**Justin Hale:** I'm rolling hot. I got an

**Ali Leonard:** Riot.

**Walden Briarhelm:** s*** together.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I got

**Justin Hale:** 18 on die for that

**Walden Briarhelm:** Are we just Oh, we're just

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** So flat

**Walden Briarhelm:** doing a naked 20. Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Ali Leonard:** d20 got a

**Walden Briarhelm:** boy. Good. I'm always real good at

**Luke Neverisky:** got six.

**Ellis Taylor:** 20.

**Justin Hale:** roll.

**Walden Briarhelm:** these. Got you all beat with the

**Tyram:** Come on

**Justin Hale:** Okay. So, group

**Tyram:** now.

**Ali Leonard:** 10

**Walden Briarhelm:** four.

**Justin Hale:** one. Uh, who's up here?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Scotty Mac is in group

**Luke Neverisky:** and

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor, what what's your

**Justin Hale:** Lance. Okay. All right.

**Luke Neverisky:** Ly got a

**Christopher Hooper:** driver name?

**Tyram:** Nine. Uh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** one.

**Luke Neverisky:** six.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, you and I are probably second

**Justin Hale:** So, so do we want to do it

**Tyram:** Denlin.

**Ali Leonard:** So, Zuger goes up

**Ellis Taylor:** How many

**Christopher Hooper:** row. I'm assuming

**Ali Leonard:** one. What did Zug

**Ellis Taylor:** spots away can you be to like not have to be in the contested?

**Christopher Hooper:** that

**Ali Leonard:** get? Oh, I got a

**Ellis Taylor:** Like can you be like one or two? Like if I was

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay,

**Ali Leonard:** 10.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Then one one

**Ellis Taylor:** here or here? Yeah. I'm trying to think make

**Ali Leonard:** Then you wouldn't be contested.


### [02:40:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** square space seems far enough away, right? I got to be

**Ellis Taylor:** sure that we could still use the zoom zoom zones. Like if you

**Christopher Hooper:** perfect.

**Walden Briarhelm:** touching. Don't let the squares touch.

**Ellis Taylor:** wanted to pass in the zoom zoom zone and then use the D4, like could you get away with not having to do this

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, it would be it would be nice to do this reshuffleling actually in the zoom zoom zones because

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** then the it provides like a catch-up mechanic almost like a slingshot if you're in the second

**Walden Briarhelm:** Something

**Ellis Taylor:** reshuffleling? I just think the only thing we're rolling now is

**Christopher Hooper:** row.

**Ellis Taylor:** basically just like movement instead of like trying to do something else with our

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, we can't do anything until we're in the red or the blue,

**Ali Leonard:** True. Yeah. So, once you're in the red, I think there's going to be

**Walden Briarhelm:** big.

**Ali Leonard:** more magic.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** That sounds like it would make things go

**Ellis Taylor:** actions.

**Justin Hale:** uh quicker, like a race. So, like we can't we're not allowed to do anything until

**Luke Neverisky:** definitely.

**Christopher Hooper:** basically.

**Justin Hale:** we're in the red zones and then that's like mini combat All

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Do you want to add more

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hello

**Christopher Hooper:** red before

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I think I'll make it kind of

**Walden Briarhelm:** again.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh

**Ali Leonard:** that same area, but it'll be longer. Does that

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Or like it would be interesting to have like a very

**Ali Leonard:** make sense?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah. I

**Christopher Hooper:** like uh like this little

**Ali Leonard:** Got a small area of red somewhere

**Ellis Taylor:** like like here

**Christopher Hooper:** bend or something like that, you know?

**Ali Leonard:** else. Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** would be fun just like al just like sprinkle in little small

**Tyram:** Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to the parts of the race where we can like

**Ali Leonard:** absolutely.

**Tyram:** try to pull shenanigans more so than anything

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** bits

**Christopher Hooper:** And then like a final like a final blind spot before the the final stretch would be cool

**Tyram:** else.

**Ali Leonard:** absolutely. Yeah. Add little pieces

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** of red. Okay, give me just another second to go to the bathroom.

**Christopher Hooper:** too. I'm just

**Ali Leonard:** I'm sorry.

**Christopher Hooper:** gonna The

**Tyram:** man. Got a bladder like spoons from a couple weeks

**Christopher Hooper:** spoon

**Walden Briarhelm:** Guys, piss

**Tyram:** ago.

**Christopher Hooper:** bladder. So, how do we

**Justin Hale:** How do we get that second L out of her

**Walden Briarhelm:** me

**Christopher Hooper:** kill?

**Justin Hale:** name?

**Walden Briarhelm:** l to hell. Spit.

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, I figure I mean, yeah, we can we can do it. We can do it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I've got my backup plan just in case, which I really

**Justin Hale:** Do do we

**Walden Briarhelm:** really don't want to fall back on

**Justin Hale:** know what that

**Walden Briarhelm:** to. I don't think anybody

**Justin Hale:** is?

**Tyram:** We as players know you're talking about the

**Walden Briarhelm:** does. I think

**Tyram:** glyph though, right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I Yes.

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Glyph. There you go. I said rune earlier. Glyph is definitely the appropriate one.

**Justin Hale:** Does my um does my mic sound better this time, by the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I don't know. Your voice sounds really

**Justin Hale:** way?

**Christopher Hooper:** annoying. Oh.

**Justin Hale:** Damn. All

**Tyram:** That's That's nothing to do with the mic

**Luke Neverisky:** That's just his normal

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, sorry.

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** over. Got

**Walden Briarhelm:** Nice. It's kind of like a sexy Italian thing coming out every now and then. It's weird. I don't I don't know. Maybe

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** What you don't see is me doing this off of the

**Walden Briarhelm:** that's just me.

**Tyram:** him.

**Walden Briarhelm:** There's kind of like pink roses in the background that envelop

**Tyram:** Man, I can confirm

**Walden Briarhelm:** the screen every now and then. It's

**Tyram:** that neither Toeer, actually. Wait, no, Justin didn't do an Italian

**Justin Hale:** camera.

**Tyram:** accent. Yeah, neither Toeer nor Matthew Neers, who has nothing to do with any of

**Justin Hale:** They can do the hands

**Tyram:** this, cannot do Italian

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I want to hear

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** though. They can do the hands for

**Tyram:** accents. That was it. That

**Walden Briarhelm:** weird.

**Justin Hale:** sure. That was the whole

**Tyram:** was the whole thing

**Justin Hale:** bit. Didn't we end up making a a fast rule of

**Tyram:** that

**Ellis Taylor:** it.

**Justin Hale:** like if they're talking, they can't do anything with their hands like in

**Christopher Hooper:** That's

**Justin Hale:** game? I feel like that was a thing to shut them up.

**Tyram:** Maybe that

**Justin Hale:** Uh I think we have time for Ally. So we played in uh in person. We played a a game called Pirate Board uh which is

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Justin Hale:** all about pirates

**Tyram:** was um it's been The like basis

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** and

**Tyram:** game for it is something called

**Justin Hale:** um and your characters notoriously die easily. That's the whole point. You just roll new characters for fun. and and Toeer. Oh, that's right.

**Tyram:** Morborg. My character made it

**Christopher Hooper:** supposedly. So did mine

**Justin Hale:** Uh Toeer Toeer and Matt's characters for some reason kept ending up Italian. So they just kept doing they kept doing Italian

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, my character

**Justin Hale:** hands more than anything

**Christopher Hooper:** had kind of a split personality between the Godfather and

**Tyram:** away. I don't know which one was more insulting to the Italian

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. The bless you.

**Justin Hale:** else.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I just uh if I could see another scene where

**Christopher Hooper:** Luigi.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Darth Vader and uh Christopher Walkan have a conversation, I could I was really vibing with that for the bit that we were

**Ellis Taylor:** That's

**Tyram:** people.

**Walden Briarhelm:** there. I I was I was laughing really hard and enjoying just the bizarreness of

**Ali Leonard:** So

**Walden Briarhelm:** accuracy meeting the content of the

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, I do want to run this by

**Walden Briarhelm:** conversation.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, never mind. She's here.

**Ali Leonard:** sorry. Do you want me

**Christopher Hooper:** It's

**Ali Leonard:** to leave again? I

**Justin Hale:** No, it's

**Ali Leonard:** can. I'm happy to. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. No, no, no. We can wait. It's fine. It's

**Ali Leonard:** fine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, no. So now you can't write.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay, so last thing I got was adding more

**Justin Hale:** fine. All

**Ali Leonard:** red.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** fine.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay, yeah, because that'll make more spots that you could do stuff for sure.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Do we feel like D8s are a large enough dice or do we want to up them to travel further? I I I don't have

**Justin Hale:** right. So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** a suggestion. I was just thinking of it cuz I'm seeing how far we moved on the first bit. If we're only going to do like three or four laps like you implied, it'll probably be

**Ellis Taylor:** Did you count how many blocks it

**Ali Leonard:** Right. The thing I was thinking if is if you're not

**Walden Briarhelm:** fine, especially with more

**Ali Leonard:** using D8s, you could just pass some of the

**Ellis Taylor:** is?

**Ali Leonard:** sections. You know what I mean? So

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, you designed it.

**Ali Leonard:** you'd have to you'd strategically have to well like then you'd have

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, well then yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** to be like okay well I'm only going to make one

**Walden Briarhelm:** No,

**Ali Leonard:** movement so that I hit that section

**Walden Briarhelm:** right. Just a thought. I don't I I don't have an exact number. Uh, but if you have

**Ali Leonard:** but I don't

**Walden Briarhelm:** it designed that way, that means D8 are for

**Ali Leonard:** specifically I just thought it

**Walden Briarhelm:** sure. Maybe you designed it

**Ali Leonard:** looked

**Walden Briarhelm:** perfectly the first try. Yeah, it looks good. Just natural

**Justin Hale:** All right, we want to go another

**Walden Briarhelm:** designer. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. So now we would start with the person in front, right? which is again

**Walden Briarhelm:** all. That's why

**Luke Neverisky:** good.

**Justin Hale:** round. You know what can I say?

**Walden Briarhelm:** he wants to roll again. Jesus.

**Justin Hale:** That's a seven and a

**Walden Briarhelm:** There we

**Justin Hale:** three. One, two, three,

**Walden Briarhelm:** go. Quick

**Justin Hale:** four, five, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Hereish. Maybe move to the side. No, that's not better. That'll

**Ali Leonard:** for

**Walden Briarhelm:** map. Oh, he's in the

**Justin Hale:** work. Smack dab in the danger

**Walden Briarhelm:** danger

**Justin Hale:** zone. 1 2 3 4

**Walden Briarhelm:** zone. Uh, I believe

**Justin Hale:** 5 6 8 9 10.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Lancy would be

**Ellis Taylor:** Is there a

**Walden Briarhelm:** next. A six. I rolled a

**Ellis Taylor:** reason we all just wouldn't roll at once and just go for

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, right

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Oh, we can do that.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** four.

**Luke Neverisky:** on. I'm guessing because

**Ellis Taylor:** it?

**Ali Leonard:** The only way that

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait a minute. What the hell? Yeah, that sounds like fun,

**Ali Leonard:** wouldn't work is if somebody's in the red zone and they don't want to just do double movements. But as long as

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** we're doing double movements, it's

**Justin Hale:** true.

**Ali Leonard:** fine. So like in the So like right now, we could

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, except we want to do like

**Ali Leonard:** just all go and then kind of see where we end up. But as once somebody's in a zone, we can see what they want to do.

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's like the starting line should just be every tables at

**Luke Neverisky:** magical makes sense. Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Huh?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, get them

**Walden Briarhelm:** once.

**Luke Neverisky:** so um because

**Justin Hale:** rolls

**Tyram:** We're doing our

**Luke Neverisky:** I had to because I had to move

**Tyram:** 38

**Luke Neverisky:** to phone to my left side. And you because someone move me

**Ellis Taylor:** Oopsies.

**Justin Hale:** in.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** f******. Is there really red?

**Justin Hale:** Yes. One, two. Wait, no, not Scotty.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I

**Tyram:** I was

**Ali Leonard:** on the on the

**Justin Hale:** nine. Okay, I rolled an eight and a one. I was very much all

**Tyram:** okay. You had it exactly average then I

**Ali Leonard:** I'm going to say it. If Lance wins, my least favorite driver will win. And I'm be so

**Christopher Hooper:** It would be such a

**Justin Hale:** over. Damn.

**Tyram:** guess. f***

**Ali Leonard:** pissed that he won in my

**Luke Neverisky:** How could he be least Sacred.

**Christopher Hooper:** shame if something were to happen at

**Ali Leonard:** game. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** You don't like Lancifer

**Ali Leonard:** Lance Stroll, I'mma name drop you. I don't like the real Lance

**Justin Hale:** right. Lancifer Europe.

**Luke Neverisky:** you've heard of it. Um, so

**Justin Hale:** Uh, you're

**Luke Neverisky:** I can't see the map. Am I within a red

**Justin Hale:** the only one in the red space. Oh, wait. Does that mean

**Ali Leonard:** character. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** space?

**Justin Hale:** that he can hit everyone else,

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, they can't see where it came from, I guess. I

**Justin Hale:** though? Scotty Mack is three spaces

**Ali Leonard:** was just thinking that. I was

**Justin Hale:** away. But if those are stands over there, they'd see something happened to his

**Luke Neverisky:** So

**Justin Hale:** car, I guess.

**Ali Leonard:** like, yeah, they would see something happened, but they wouldn't see who did

**Luke Neverisky:** It's

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** true. What about Let me see. What about if I were to cast you seen here to cast hypnotic pattern like right above me? So that way cars coming into the combat zone have to make that save or be uh incapacitated

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. You don't want to make any

**Luke Neverisky:** driving.

**Ali Leonard:** movement. Yeah, you can

**Luke Neverisky:** Can I also make a movement after like I have two

**Ali Leonard:** do two actions. Yeah. So, how would that work? So, they

**Luke Neverisky:** actions?

**Ali Leonard:** if they pass you or if they

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. So, I guess how about this? I'll move one first to kind of get further in the red

**Tyram:** Well, it it might be necessary to

**Luke Neverisky:** zone.

**Tyram:** fudge the mechanics of the spells a little bit for the racing situation

**Ali Leonard:** hypnotic Yeah. I was just trying

**Tyram:** because this pattern is supposed to just go

**Ali Leonard:** to think, is it something you can leave behind or is it

**Tyram:** off. Yeah, knock pattern is supposed to go off the second you cast it

**Ali Leonard:** something

**Tyram:** and then be done. It's not like a you can't leave it behind like a landmine or

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, oh, I thought it was a thing. Okay. Okay, never mind then. Um trying to go through mobile here. So I moved I moved one. Someone could

**Ali Leonard:** Hell

**Luke Neverisky:** please do that for me. Um All right. Spell spell spell spell. I hate the TNT mobile

**Tyram:** something.

**Luke Neverisky:** app.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I wish I could pick one user

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Um All right. What about

**Ali Leonard:** yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** this? Yeah. Um, I will, um, I'm gonna cast right behind me a cloud of

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, like in the red

**Luke Neverisky:** daggers at a like I want to try to aim the

**Ali Leonard:** zone.

**Walden Briarhelm:** experience.

**Luke Neverisky:** cloud. Yeah. And I want to try to aim the cloud like

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** pretty low to the ground so that way it'll just hit like tires like or spikes

**Tyram:** I'm just picturing that is like the trunk of your

**Ali Leonard:** Damn. Feel like that car is gonna have

**Luke Neverisky:** or whatever.

**Tyram:** car opens up and just like a bunch of like cow trucks or something come

**Ali Leonard:** fun.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to go for here.

**Tyram:** out.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. Clothe daggers. And what does that do? Like

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Um, so if a creature Yeah, it's a 40 core slashing damage

**Ali Leonard:** damage. 44. Okay. And if that that's anybody passing through

**Luke Neverisky:** basically. Yep.

**Ali Leonard:** it. Okay. And how long does it

**Luke Neverisky:** a

**Ali Leonard:** last? Great. Okay. How

**Ali Leonard:** circle.

**Luke Neverisky:** Sweet.

**Tyram:** I think this is going by pretty quick and we want to try to see how much we can get done tonight. You

**Christopher Hooper:** Next turn we

**Tyram:** know, I am questioning like if finishing this race is going

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Tyram:** to take up a full session is also something worth

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** kill.

**Tyram:** considering.

**Ali Leonard:** true. Well, it's Conny Max's turn.

**Ellis Taylor:** that? Yeah. Yeah. Management in

**Christopher Hooper:** For areas

**Ali Leonard:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** of effect, are we using the uh dimensions in the
