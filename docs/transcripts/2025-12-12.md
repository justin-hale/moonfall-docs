**Justin Hale:** Nice.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a very simple game. Yet it's not because there's a ranked mode. So that you have to play ranked and then you see people who do things that just blow your mind and you're like, "So this game isn't simple. It's simple to me because I'm

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's 100% how this one is. You'll be going through it. I don't know. The the NPCs that you fight in this game, too, are

**Walden Briarhelm:** simple.

**Tyram:** again. Papa Toeer, that was that was cringy, dude.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Paper.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh no problem, my

**Tyram:** didn't like that either, but

**Justin Hale:** That

**Ali Leonard:** general, but that was fun.

**Christopher Hooper:** baby. I

**Tyram:** I I feel like Toeer normally wouldn't say that like

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** feels worse. That feels

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** just like in a

**Luke Neverisky:** we

**Christopher Hooper:** got Hello, my babies. I got

**Tyram:** to, man. Look at how far out in first place I am. H love to see

**Christopher Hooper:** Right. Yeah. I'm really hoping I can get some magic in before you get too far

**Tyram:** it. Well, we're all trying to kill El's bits, so

**Justin Hale:** meeting. I had

**Tyram:** why the hell would you do anything to

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I assume that those with you know is a

**Christopher Hooper:** away.

**Justin Hale:** something. Yeah, clear. Clearly Denlin is trying to

**Tyram:** me? I don't

**Justin Hale:** kill El Smith with how far he is in the lead. He's trying

**Ali Leonard:** ghost.

**Tyram:** think Justin ever posted the uh the summary from last week. I feel like

**Justin Hale:** to kill her with last

**Tyram:** the image of it should be the poster from John Wick 2 where everyone's like pointing a gun

**Justin Hale:** place.

**Tyram:** at John Wick, but it should be like

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, absolutely. I do feel

**Tyram:** Ellsworth.

**Justin Hale:** That's pretty

**Ali Leonard:** like you kind of hate me and that's why you didn't do

**Tyram:** This your DMing. You made us do

**Ali Leonard:** one for Elsus. No, not you.

**Justin Hale:** good.

**Ali Leonard:** I mean Justin because he didn't create an

**Justin Hale:** What? Oh, I haven't done

**Ali Leonard:** image for this. So I

**Justin Hale:** anything

**Ali Leonard:** feel like personally attacked and that he hates

**Tyram:** this. It is hard not to come to that

**Justin Hale:** because there's a little bit of that. There is a little essence of that.

**Ali Leonard:** me. So right like

**Justin Hale:** Yes. Yeah, every time every

**Ali Leonard:** immediately you kind of think

**Tyram:** conclusion.

**Justin Hale:** time I went to go make the summary for it, I was like, "No, I hate her. I forgot I hate

**Ali Leonard:** that I could feel it all the way over

**Justin Hale:** her. Work has been insane." Because, you know, everyone

**Ali Leonard:** here.

**Justin Hale:** wants to be off for the holidays. So, everyone's trying to stuff a month's worth of work into like a week and a

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's so

**Justin Hale:** half.

**Walden Briarhelm:** accurate.

**Justin Hale:** What the hell was I gonna do to Denlin? I totally forgot.

**Ali Leonard:** something. I hope

**Christopher Hooper:** Wait. So, we're not going to

**Tyram:** It seems like

**Justin Hale:** Now, you can do what you

**Christopher Hooper:** target Denlin. We're going to target Ellswith.

**Tyram:** the obvious thing to do to me.

**Justin Hale:** want. I'm report

**Christopher Hooper:** Now,

**Luke Neverisky:** Someone

**Justin Hale:** are. They'll see someone messing with

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Justin Hale:** you. They'll see poor

**Ellis Taylor:** actually I need a measure

**Justin Hale:** unfortunate things happening to Dland's car, but whoever is the

**Tyram:** me. Okay. I thought we had some like anti-ell solidarity coming in

**Christopher Hooper:** I thought it was

**Tyram:** tonight. Clearly I was

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Justin Hale:** culprit. No, it's anti This is

**Ali Leonard:** Everybody wants to win.

**Ellis Taylor:** measure.

**Tyram:** clearly clearly the camaraderie that I thought we had is

**Justin Hale:** This is such a game of munchkin and you know

**Tyram:** not panning out

**Justin Hale:** it. This is a game of munchkin in race

**Tyram:** here. f***. I hate

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's

**Justin Hale:** form. Basically,

**Ali Leonard:** I've never played

**Walden Briarhelm:** good stuff.

**Justin Hale:** everyone is friends with each other until you get to level nine and then everyone just

**Tyram:** Munchkin. Yeah, that's why I f****** hate

**Justin Hale:** beats the s*** out of the person at level 9 so that they don't win at level

**Ali Leonard:** that. Okay, great. At least it's

**Ellis Taylor:** I Yeah,

**Tyram:** Munchkin.

**Justin Hale:** 10.

**Ali Leonard:** not a line game like Secret Hitler, which I do suck at, or

**Ellis Taylor:** Munchkin. Taylor hates

**Tyram:** Munchkin is just luck and it punishes you

**Ali Leonard:** Werewolf.

**Ellis Taylor:** Munchkin.

**Tyram:** for doing

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, it's so much fun. It's

**Justin Hale:** I love Munchkin's one of those games you very much have to play with people that aren't highly competitive because I've had friends literally walk out

**Ellis Taylor:** chaos.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** of my house over games of Munchkin

**Ali Leonard:** That's funny.

**Tyram:** it. Yes, I

**Walden Briarhelm:** yeah, it can be taken very

**Justin Hale:** before.

**Ali Leonard:** I'll have to remember

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, those are the best. Taylor

**Christopher Hooper:** Is it Taylor? Taylor hates Munchkin,

**Tyram:** hate my

**Ellis Taylor:** had punch skin.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Who's next?

**Luke Neverisky:** Damn.

**Ali Leonard:** front.

**Ellis Taylor:** action and I'm going use one of my channel divinities to

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Ellis Taylor:** do AB foes. So, three people within 60 ft of me, which I just

**Justin Hale:** Serge Dinland is

**Ellis Taylor:** checked. Yeah, I'm going to

**Justin Hale:** less than 60 ft from me. Just

**Ellis Taylor:** do I I know that's why that's what

**Justin Hale:** saying.

**Ellis Taylor:** I was debating. Who's Scotty Mac and Berstop again? I was definely going to do

**Tyram:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** Uh, hold on. First of all, burst stop is me and I'm on your

**Ellis Taylor:** Ellswith.

**Tyram:** yeah, but you hate

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, but I I you I might lose a job if you Okay, so I'm going to

**Tyram:** him. There are so many people who logically you would

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well,

**Justin Hale:** team, but

**Ellis Taylor:** do uh Denlin

**Tyram:** target instead of me.

**Walden Briarhelm:** now most Scotty Mac isn't worth any of your

**Justin Hale:** I I thought we were a

**Walden Briarhelm:** time.

**Ali Leonard:** Technically, you're being paid by the same person. Your

**Ellis Taylor:** Ell. Yes, but I might get

**Justin Hale:** team. I thought we were

**Ali Leonard:** colleagues, your workplace

**Ellis Taylor:** bumped if he I need to I need to

**Justin Hale:** calling I thought we were workplace

**Ali Leonard:** proximity associates at

**Ellis Taylor:** win. Actually, no. You're

**Justin Hale:** proximity associates.

**Ellis Taylor:** already you're already bumped down to one action per turn,

**Tyram:** He's

**Ali Leonard:** best.

**Ellis Taylor:** aren't you? Because you're you're already frightened, aren't

**Tyram:** slowed by uh

**Justin Hale:** Sounds Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** you? Oh, slowed. Okay. So, no, I don't want to do that cuz it'll

**Tyram:** by I mean both can be

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** true at the same time. It's not either

**Justin Hale:** I kind of figured you guys

**Tyram:** or.

**Justin Hale:** would come after me since like my character is like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** the, you know, the golden boy of the race or

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. So, I mean, how would it work if he if he becomes frightened? Would he not be able to take actions at all or he still could only do one

**Tyram:** um he would not be able to move closer to the source of his fear and um he would have disadvantage on attack roles and that completely stacks with the effects of slow. They can both totally be

**Justin Hale:** whatever.

**Ellis Taylor:** action?

**Tyram:** active at the same

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yeah, I'm

**Tyram:** time.

**Ellis Taylor:** gonna do L's first. Denlin in

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Um, are we are we doing action bonus action for one thing or just like one spell kind of

**Ali Leonard:** It's a great

**Walden Briarhelm:** antics.

**Ali Leonard:** question. I think we were doing I don't know. I don't think we've come across multiple

**Justin Hale:** situation? Okay. Um, can I did I

**Ali Leonard:** spells

**Justin Hale:** miss these steps?

**Ali Leonard:** yet.

**Walden Briarhelm:** It can't take your car

**Justin Hale:** Cool. I missed some stuff over

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, we had a teleport. I don't see why we can't miss you

**Ellis Taylor:** God damn it. We could have missed these

**Walden Briarhelm:** though. No,

**Ali Leonard:** step. I mean,

**Ellis Taylor:** stuff. Wait, can you miss the stuff with your vehicle

**Walden Briarhelm:** unless you stay.

**Justin Hale:** here. Oh, can we

**Ali Leonard:** you are your vehicle, are you

**Tyram:** I was able to do I was able to do a teleport last

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh.

**Ali Leonard:** not? Because you

**Tyram:** session, but I don't think Justin should be allowed to

**Ali Leonard:** teleported. Yeah. So that's why we were

**Ellis Taylor:** though? Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, s***. I was looking at Misti

**Justin Hale:** not

**Ali Leonard:** like new session, new

**Tyram:** now.

**Walden Briarhelm:** step and the rule said you can't take your vehicle and I was like, "Well, that sucks.

**Ali Leonard:** rules.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I forgot we went full cars version." That's all right.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, you're like you're it's like

**Walden Briarhelm:** Scotty Mac has bad

**Ali Leonard:** full cars but like you are your car at this

**Ellis Taylor:** Wait, didn't we all get misty stuff? Oh,

**Tyram:** I don't need I can do

**Ellis Taylor:** no. Doesn't matter. Never

**Tyram:** my thing multiple times. So, I do still have a pretty distinct advantage

**Walden Briarhelm:** memory.

**Justin Hale:** That's why I was asking if I could do two things like an action bonus action

**Ellis Taylor:** mind.

**Tyram:** here. But

**Justin Hale:** situation.

**Ali Leonard:** point.

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, you get two actions. I guess we could just count a bonus

**Tyram:** he's slow.

**Justin Hale:** I don't because I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** action and an action.

**Justin Hale:** slowed. Um, just as a future asking for a friend, how heavy are our cars?

**Ali Leonard:** about 2,000

**Tyram:** Well, but

**Justin Hale:** Damn. Okay, so not 500

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh.

**Tyram:** Justin's is probably heavier than that though,

**Ellis Taylor:** Justin, did you mean to

**Justin Hale:** dare.

**Ali Leonard:** pounds.

**Tyram:** cheating?

**Walden Briarhelm:** He took he didn't take his

**Ali Leonard:** I don't know. I don't When I look now, he's not in

**Walden Briarhelm:** hand off the page. He can still go

**Justin Hale:** here. And that's 60 ft here.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yeah.

**Tyram:** say

**Justin Hale:** again. We're just going to look at the number from here. Oh, that's a 16 on die. What did I have to be? Tougher,

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Justin Hale:** you're muted.

**Ali Leonard:** He's is

**Ellis Taylor:** mean right

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, kind

**Christopher Hooper:** it's plus one. Two.

**Justin Hale:** 16. All right, that's it for

**Tyram:** okay. I was I was going to be genuinely shocked if Brew was a

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Ali Leonard:** Did we

**Tyram:** wise

**Ellis Taylor:** He saved against my wisdom as

**Justin Hale:** Brew is a very wise person.

**Ali Leonard:** miss Scotty Mac? Were you

**Justin Hale:** First step has

**Ali Leonard:** done? Were you Scotty Mac? Were you done with

**Ellis Taylor:** well.

**Christopher Hooper:** Scotty

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, I've gone and so his first

**Ali Leonard:** your turn? Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mac. Scotty

**Tyram:** person.

**Ali Leonard:** I just want to make sure cuz I didn't ask if you were done. I just wanted to make sure we didn't miss

**Walden Briarhelm:** step. I mean, if I can finish my turn

**Justin Hale:** been

**Walden Briarhelm:** with the misty step, I would do

**Ali Leonard:** you. Have you already done

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Walden Briarhelm:** that. I

**Ali Leonard:** two

**Christopher Hooper:** Mac

**Walden Briarhelm:** have I too like to live

**Ali Leonard:** action? Okay,

**Tyram:** You know, it makes sense that Scotty Mack would not be adept at cheating, being being

**Walden Briarhelm:** dangerously. Yes. Yes. But

**Ali Leonard:** Ly. Yeah. He's like, "Ah, dang

**Tyram:** an honest

**Walden Briarhelm:** how's everybody getting so far ahead? This is

**Ali Leonard:** it. Like some people I feel like have been waiting their

**Tyram:** sort.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** wild.

**Ali Leonard:** entire lives to be able to like cheat and then

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Scotty

**Ali Leonard:** like some of us are like wait I don't get

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Oh, that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mac literally is waited his whole life. I'm about to take over

**Justin Hale:** You guys are cheating.

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, I guess I'll move again. I'm one way from the

**Walden Briarhelm:** the company from Papy.

**Luke Neverisky:** cheating zone. All right.

**Ali Leonard:** it. Hell yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Three. Uh, that's it. Fancy. He just moved quite a bit.

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah, I

**Justin Hale:** Me

**Ali Leonard:** god. It all comes back.

**Christopher Hooper:** forgot.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** too.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Like, why is Luke talking like an idiot? Oh yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah, that's it. I moved 11

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** A It's a good turn. Zer's turn.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, we don't have to do it on this round. Um, but to enable more shenanigans,

**Luke Neverisky:** spaces.

**Christopher Hooper:** can we return to normal action economy? Um,

**Justin Hale:** Just because

**Christopher Hooper:** but just keep the movement with the D8

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** you're asking. No, because I don't like what I don't

**Ellis Taylor:** But I'll keep I'll keep

**Justin Hale:** like I don't like your

**Ali Leonard:** What does that

**Ellis Taylor:** two. So wait, how would that work?

**Christopher Hooper:** thing.

**Ellis Taylor:** We

**Christopher Hooper:** It means that you can have a bonus action separate from your

**Justin Hale:** intentions.

**Ali Leonard:** mean? So it would because normal action is movement action

**Luke Neverisky:** god.

**Ali Leonard:** bonus action. This would just be action bonus

**Christopher Hooper:** action, right? So it'

**Ali Leonard:** action and then you can do

**Christopher Hooper:** be you 1d8 for move. You can choose use your

**Tyram:** Like if

**Ali Leonard:** another movement or do something else and a bonus.

**Christopher Hooper:** action for

**Tyram:** we were using the normal action economy, you can always uh sacrifice your

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** action to dash. So like we can still do the it's fundamentally not that different than what we would normally be doing. The only real difference is how we're

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Exactly.

**Tyram:** moving.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. Okay. It's fine me. Whatever's easier.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. Yeah. And I think we should do it this round because you know who has great bonus second but or bonus

**Ali Leonard:** No. Hey, Papa.

**Christopher Hooper:** actions?

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, Habito for

**Justin Hale:** Oh, I don't I don't like that spreading.

**Ali Leonard:** No.

**Ellis Taylor:** way. And its movement gets like half. Remember, we can't We're not trying to kill each

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh.

**Ali Leonard:** Kill

**Ellis Taylor:** other. We're trying to frame Elizabeth, not kill

**Christopher Hooper:** I guess if

**Luke Neverisky:** Is he the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, really?

**Christopher Hooper:** we all if Elizabeth is the only one that

**Luke Neverisky:** only looks

**Ali Leonard:** Smith. Technically, I win. It

**Christopher Hooper:** survives the race, it'll probably look pretty shady.

**Luke Neverisky:** suspicious?

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** would look really suspicious if I'm the only one that survives. For

**Ellis Taylor:** Elizabeth. I mean, I

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** sure.

**Ellis Taylor:** also There is an open investigation on if she

**Ali Leonard:** I mean, there's a lot of, you know, pots in the

**Ellis Taylor:** uh tried to

**Ali Leonard:** fire. What sticks is the thing. You know, we've got a lot of video of me

**Justin Hale:** So, are we are we trying

**Ali Leonard:** with some

**Ellis Taylor:** sabotage.

**Justin Hale:** to reduce Smith's hit points to zero or are we just trying

**Ali Leonard:** hookers. If

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, you're already under investigation for

**Justin Hale:** to like

**Ali Leonard:** I So, there is a pit. So,

**Ellis Taylor:** cheating.

**Ali Leonard:** where we started, and you can get fixed up at your pit, but it does take as many rounds as you want. So, like if I get reduced to zero, if I get reduced to zero, then I'm out. But if I get low, then I would go to my

**Justin Hale:** Um, and

**Ali Leonard:** pit if I pass it. And you know, that's the

**Justin Hale:** what happens if I knock you off the track?

**Ali Leonard:** pit. I don't know, man. I started taking a nap. I don't

**Justin Hale:** Um, okay. I'm just going to roll. I never found my dice. Wait, wait. There they

**Walden Briarhelm:** The vertical dice are a hot tomato. Oh

**Justin Hale:** sheep.

**Ali Leonard:** What? Anybody

**Luke Neverisky:** A vowel. You want a bow? Okay. Sorry. I'll shut

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's good.

**Ali Leonard:** traps?

**Ellis Taylor:** Serge is calling his lawyers and putting his neck in

**Tyram:** calling Morgan and

**Ali Leonard:** Feels about

**Ellis Taylor:** a brace.

**Luke Neverisky:** up.

**Justin Hale:** the

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Or for your parents out

**Ali Leonard:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** there, Unicorse from

**Tyram:** Morgan.

**Ali Leonard:** So, as you guys are sitting in the pit, you see your teams all come

**Ellis Taylor:** Bluey.

**Ali Leonard:** out and your team captains, which or some of you I guess is your dad. I don't know who your team like your team mechanic is.

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Ali Leonard:** They tell you to get out of the car and that the race is cancelled and to get up to the office of Top

**Walden Briarhelm:** Happy.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm already out of my

**Ali Leonard:** Bonito. And if anybody can figure out how to get him into not being a sheep, that

**Luke Neverisky:** right. I don't know who did that,

**Ali Leonard:** would be great. A race official is yelling as he like tugs on you with like a

**Luke Neverisky:** but I don't know. But I'm pretty sure I saw

**Ali Leonard:** leash.

**Luke Neverisky:** Elizabeth say a thing or two before it

**Tyram:** H. This would be an ingenious way to punish orphans when they mouth

**Luke Neverisky:** happened. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

**Ali Leonard:** and they usher everybody upstairs. And I don't think elevators are invented, so it's a lot of stairs. So, sorry about that. And we have to wait for the sheep to get all the way up there. Can sheep go back downstairs? I don't think cows can. Can sheep go

**Tyram:** off.

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's a great question. Goats can

**Ali Leonard:** downstairs? Is that sheep just kind of stuck

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't think so. I don't think

**Luke Neverisky:** That's where you live now for the next 50

**Christopher Hooper:** so.

**Tyram:** Well, if if an hour has gone by by the time all this happens, then he would

**Luke Neverisky:** minutes.

**Tyram:** turn back to

**Ali Leonard:** upstairs? It would be pretty much right after the race, so he would still be

**Luke Neverisky:** What about I guess maybe like I'll

**Ali Leonard:** a sheep, I

**Luke Neverisky:** I'll pick an opportune moment to unconentry on polymorph if we can get

**Ali Leonard:** think.

**Luke Neverisky:** sheep vers

**Tyram:** normal. Oh, wait. He polymorphed with his car, right? Right. So when you

**Ali Leonard:** So the car also Oh my

**Ellis Taylor:** Because they are one.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I mean the car definitely can't

**Ali Leonard:** god. That Yeah, that

**Christopher Hooper:** go downstairs.

**Luke Neverisky:** up. Well, Tio Bonia is going to have a nice decoration

**Ali Leonard:** would Oh

**Luke Neverisky:** in his office.

**Ali Leonard:** god. Yeah, I need cool decoration. Whenever whenever you want to unpolymorph, you can. If you don't

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. All right. No, let's bring the giant sheet up there. Sheep up there for

**Ali Leonard:** want to, you don't have

**Tyram:** unpol

**Ali Leonard:** to. Okay. So, you all make it to the office. Everybody has to help push the sheep up the stairs cuz he's so big. And then there's

**Luke Neverisky:** now.

**Ali Leonard:** a bunch of race officials in there. And they all look

**Tyram:** Denlin is going to go stand

**Ali Leonard:** very cross like this is

**Tyram:** with the race officials and look disapprovingly over at the rest

**Ali Leonard:** their like their one job.

**Tyram:** of

**Christopher Hooper:** The zoo does the same

**Tyram:** you.

**Ali Leonard:** Damn. And

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm not

**Walden Briarhelm:** during the

**Ali Leonard:** sure. Yeah. So everybody gets up there and Tito Bonito looks just like a disappointed

**Luke Neverisky:** working.

**Ali Leonard:** dad. He invites everybody to sit, but you don't have to if you don't want to. It's at the same table. Yeah. Oh, right. You can't. You broke your

**Ellis Taylor:** foot?

**Ali Leonard:** need medical attention. There is also a sheep in here.

**Tyram:** is all thanks to

**Ali Leonard:** Um, that was my question. What is happening? We haven't had to cancel race ever. I'm hearing a lot of information that it was Elizabeth. Elizabeth, are

**Tyram:** Elizabeth. Well, I can confirm that Elizabeth said

**Ali Leonard:** you What have you

**Tyram:** over the radio, "It's sheep time." And then turn staff into

**Ali Leonard:** done?

**Ali Leonard:** So Serge is slightly on

**Tyram:** yes. I like the idea that just like burning in front of us this whole

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** I like to imagine my hair is just like

**Tyram:** time.

**Ali Leonard:** sheep thing also

**Ellis Taylor:** smoldering the back and I'm like, "Oh, f***. f***." Going to use the arm that's in the

**Christopher Hooper:** fire.

**Luke Neverisky:** gonna I'm going to be uh I'm gonna start edging away

**Ali Leonard:** bad. A lot of firebolt. I heard something about

**Ellis Taylor:** swing.

**Luke Neverisky:** from edging away from verse stop. Just getting some distance between me and the giant sheep. No reason. No

**Ali Leonard:** hookers. Sure. Okay. The sheep thing. So that's like

**Luke Neverisky:** reason.

**Ali Leonard:** at least five big things. Then there was the thing with with Versop's car. So we have precedent. She tried to do something in Versaf's car and

**Tyram:** You can see on the track too that she created a

**Ali Leonard:** now he's a

**Tyram:** shortcut for

**Ali Leonard:** sheep. There's proof on the Okay, we're going to have

**Tyram:** herself. Yes, it start in big letters. Shortcut for

**Ali Leonard:** to check that out. So let me write all this down.

**Tyram:** Ellmith.

**Ali Leonard:** So this race is definitely

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. Saw it for good.

**Ali Leonard:** canceled. I mean we have to research these allegations. Absolutely. I will also say you also have allegations against you. So, we will be looking into that as well. When

**Christopher Hooper:** about.

**Tyram:** And I don't know if it relates to the race or not, but she was

**Ali Leonard:** Ellswith and we're gonna have

**Tyram:** soliciting a bunch of hookers

**Christopher Hooper:** crimes lawyer. He has a smoking gun

**Ali Leonard:** I guess

**Christopher Hooper:** evidence for Elizabeth offshore bank accounts to avoid

**Ali Leonard:** we'll I don't know what a lot of those words mean, but we will talk

**Christopher Hooper:** taxation.

**Ali Leonard:** about it. But Elizabeth, it definitely looks like there's a lot of cause, so we're going to have to do a lot of investigating on this. For in the meantime, you're definitely

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, heat.

**Luke Neverisky:** All


### [02:50:00]

**Ali Leonard:** suspended. Uh I guess that's it. We'll let everyone know. But this race was definitely cancelled. We'll have to reschedule obviously for the

**Christopher Hooper:** charity.

**Tyram:** that's a you're the one who's like uh creating the theater of the mind space

**Ali Leonard:** car?
