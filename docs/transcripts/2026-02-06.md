**Tyram:** Fancymancy.

**Justin Hale:** Boy. I'll probably go back to iPhone when the iPhone Fold comes out, but uh I'm really digging the uh the Android phone

**Christopher Hooper:** been really considering doing a

**Justin Hale:** right

**Christopher Hooper:** um doing a fold.

**Tyram:** can't that I didn't see what that was. What was

**Christopher Hooper:** one.

**Justin Hale:** size. Do what? Oh, that time I got reincarnated of the slime. Um, books are like legit books on here. Like fullon whole ass pages. That's amazing. And then the processor in this thing is stupid quick because I can do really dumb stuff

**Tyram:** it?

**Justin Hale:** like this. Hold

**Tyram:** Well, while you're doing that, there is something I wanted to ask the two of you. Oh, cool. Like a DS

**Justin Hale:** on. 3DS emulation and it's like perfect. It hardly stutters

**Tyram:** emulator.

**Justin Hale:** at all. It's it I'm I'm blown away

**Tyram:** Well, well

**Justin Hale:** because 3DS is like notoriously hard to emulate.

**Tyram:** done. Oh, but um so next week we're scheduled to do the uh uh dagger heart uh opener. Um but you we're currently scheduled for Valentine's Day. Is that going to be okay with you guys who have uh you know significant

**Justin Hale:** Uh um it's fine

**Tyram:** others?

**Justin Hale:** with me slash us because me and Christina hardly ever uh celebr celebrate Valentine's Day because our anniversary is the following week. Uh so it

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** doesn't matter to

**Tyram:** Okay. Just wanted to make sure

**Justin Hale:** us. Um, what other mangas am I reading? I'm reading Slime, My Hero Academia, um, Quality Assurance in Another World, and The Great Cleric. I've been reading some uh Korean mangas, too. I've been way behind on those, like the beginning after the

**Tyram:** Okay. I'm

**Justin Hale:** end. Can't remember what the other one I was reading

**Tyram:** mostly just a basic b**** when it comes to manga. I just mostly read things like

**Justin Hale:** was

**Tyram:** One

**Justin Hale:** though. Oh, yeah. Well, I burned through Dragon Ball Super like a like a generic manga person and they stopped making it. before he died. They stopped making it before he

**Tyram:** Piece.

**Luke Neverisky:** We're

**Justin Hale:** died. Uh, Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball Z or Dragon Ball in

**Luke Neverisky:** good.

**Justin Hale:** general, he died oh gosh, three years ago

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, okay. Is that

**Justin Hale:** now. Right. When did he die? Let's see. Yeah. 2020. Oh, 2024. Okay. March of

**Luke Neverisky:** recent? Well,

**Ellis Taylor:** What's happening

**Tyram:** is finding us some hopefully royalty-free

**Luke Neverisky:** Jedi,

**Justin Hale:** 2024.

**Tyram:** music. Oh, but uh Luke and Martha, how are your guys' weeks?

**Luke Neverisky:** baby.

**Ellis Taylor:** here?

**Tyram:** Got

**Justin Hale:** Mine has not been

**Luke Neverisky:** Same must be nice.

**Ellis Taylor:** Busy.

**Justin Hale:** busy. Well, uh, I showed up to work Monday morning to, uh, my

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Ellis Taylor:** screaming. Oh

**Justin Hale:** manager's account being deactivated and I was like,

**Luke Neverisky:** no. Does it turn

**Justin Hale:** "Oh, that's weird. What happened?" And then I was talking to co-workers and they were like,

**Luke Neverisky:** in?

**Justin Hale:** "I don't know. I don't I don't see him anywhere. I don't see him in like the directory or

**Tyram:** him.

**Justin Hale:** anything." And uh, then we were were talking to some other groups

**Ellis Taylor:** no.

**Justin Hale:** and their managers got terminated and we were like, "Uh, what's going on?" So turns out Assurian cut 15%

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Justin Hale:** more of their uh of their workforce

**Luke Neverisky:** huge. 15%. God damn. At

**Justin Hale:** restructuring.

**Luke Neverisky:** least it wasn't you again, you

**Justin Hale:** Yep. Well, right. It was a what, a year ago that um I got laid off during a 25% cut of the company. I got hired back a week later, but still

**Luke Neverisky:** know?

**Justin Hale:** like they cut 25% of the company. So we're up to what 40%

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Justin Hale:** from

**Luke Neverisky:** massive. Is the Aurian product is what?

**Justin Hale:** them.

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh insurance for electronic stuff. Is that right?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. They're having a bit of an identity crisis at the moment

**Ellis Taylor:** Everything.

**Justin Hale:** because they're they're trying to branch out, you know, as

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** I want

**Justin Hale:** public corporate companies do. They have to continue their bottom line. So guess they are still the backbone for most of the big uh uh cell phone carriers. But now if you buy something on like

**Ellis Taylor:** you to get rid

**Justin Hale:** Amazon, you'll sometimes get a popup saying like do you want to get insurance by a shurion? And then what else are they offered on? Like it's the most random things that you can get covered. Oh, if you get like um like that home insurance like inhome insurance stuff. So like when you buy like a

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh yeah.

**Justin Hale:** washer and dryer or a fridge or any like hey we'll sell you this insurance that takes care of all of the appliances in your house. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** Is that a recent

**Ellis Taylor:** Shin strongest.

**Justin Hale:** usually through a sharing now too. Uh it's been a few years. It's been like three years now that they've been doing that. But keep pivoting to those things. Uh I think because they're a little scared of of not um padded by the the mobile

**Luke Neverisky:** change? Yeah. I

**Ellis Taylor:** But I'm


### [00:10:00]

**Justin Hale:** insurance business. They lost Sprint when that

**Ellis Taylor:** so

**Justin Hale:** merger with T-Mobile happened and then T-Mobile didn't renew the contract. They don't have

**Ellis Taylor:** She's angry.

**Justin Hale:** T-Mobile business at all. So, all they have is like Verizon and

**Luke Neverisky:** mean, right.

**Justin Hale:** AT&T and any of their like

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Okay. Huh. I mean, I understand the diversification, not wanting to have a single cash cow of whatever,

**Justin Hale:** subsidies.

**Luke Neverisky:** but Huh.

**Justin Hale:** Sure. I mean, so Sherian's been around

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm sure everything will be

**Justin Hale:** since the the early 2000s, I think. They kind of been

**Luke Neverisky:** right when

**Justin Hale:** resting on their laurels for the past what, 20

**Luke Neverisky:** cell phones were really just taking off. I'm guessing that was

**Ellis Taylor:** fine.

**Justin Hale:** years. Yeah. Uh this is all they've been doing

**Christopher Hooper:** question.

**Justin Hale:** until I mean basically when I started back in 2020. So

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** I wonder how much

**Ellis Taylor:** Another

**Justin Hale:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** like uh like iPhone build quality has like really messed up

**Ellis Taylor:** life. We're seeing

**Christopher Hooper:** uh Aurian's like uh like money

**Ellis Taylor:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** plan

**Justin Hale:** they

**Christopher Hooper:** cuz I feel like phones used to break like so so easily and now like they're like really hardy Like you really got to like drop it on like at the right angle on like concrete or

**Luke Neverisky:** We like to thank our sponsor

**Christopher Hooper:** something like

**Justin Hale:** Right.

**Luke Neverisky:** Apple. They're really wellbuilt

**Christopher Hooper:** that. And Gorilla

**Luke Neverisky:** phones.

**Justin Hale:** The biggest swing there though is that

**Luke Neverisky:** Sorry.

**Christopher Hooper:** Glass.

**Justin Hale:** um phones cost way more now and they cost way more

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, he's

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah, that's

**Justin Hale:** to people people are getting

**Christopher Hooper:** true.

**Justin Hale:** insurance because they pretty much can't afford it if their phone breaks. You know, before it was like meh, you know, kind of half and half, but like I broke my iPhone and uh it um it

**Luke Neverisky:** sure. Wow, that's might as well

**Justin Hale:** cost me $300 to fix

**Luke Neverisky:** buy a new phone at that point.

**Justin Hale:** it. I mean, it's a

**Tyram:** I have to

**Luke Neverisky:** I take it

**Christopher Hooper:** Did

**Justin Hale:** $1,200 phone, so

**Tyram:** say, yeah, that is much more affordable than getting a new phone, which I

**Christopher Hooper:** you just

**Justin Hale:** do

**Tyram:** guess uh kind of goes with Justin's point there.

**Luke Neverisky:** back. Yeah, you can

**Christopher Hooper:** Did you just

**Justin Hale:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** repair it with like DS

**Tyram:** But

**Justin Hale:** still I took it to a local repair shop to do that work on

**Luke Neverisky:** tell.

**Justin Hale:** it though because like my uh

**Christopher Hooper:** parts?

**Justin Hale:** eventual like trade in or or private selling of that phone will still be more than what it

**Christopher Hooper:** Are

**Justin Hale:** costs to repair it. But I wasn't going to go buy a new iPhone. Like if the iPhone F was coming out, I wouldn't have fixed my my current phone. Like if the iPhone F was already out, I would have just bought that instead. But rather than do all that, I'm going to fix this

**Christopher Hooper:** you

**Justin Hale:** iPhone and then use that as trade in towards the iPhone F when that comes out

**Luke Neverisky:** Interesting. Yeah, the phone you sent me a picture of last night. f******

**Justin Hale:** if Yeah, dude. I love

**Tyram:** I don't see Oh, all did. I was about to ask

**Luke Neverisky:** huge.

**Justin Hale:** this thing. It's great.

**Tyram:** if Ally ever responded, but never mind. Here's

**Christopher Hooper:** She's

**Tyram:** Ally. That's even better than Ally

**Christopher Hooper:** here. Here she

**Tyram:** responding. No, he's

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** is. Yeah. And Zach's not here tonight. So, this is the whole game.

**Justin Hale:** Luke, here's your comparison to

**Tyram:** not.

**Luke Neverisky:** right. Oh, okay. That's okay. It It was bigger in the photo

**Christopher Hooper:** Come

**Justin Hale:** scale.

**Luke Neverisky:** maybe.

**Justin Hale:** big for a phone standards, but yeah, it's

**Tyram:** Oh, but Justin, have you mastered igloo making

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Oh

**Justin Hale:** crazy. Oh, we just got uh we just

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** got two more inches of snow

**Tyram:** yet?

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah. Do you miss living in Tennessee

**Christopher Hooper:** quick.

**Ellis Taylor:** jeez. I got that.

**Justin Hale:** today. I mean, not recently. No, I can all but guarantee that my old house did not have power like the minute everyone was losing power and they were probably the last ones to get power

**Luke Neverisky:** yet? That's good. All

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** too. We used power in our at our turfway house when the wind

**Christopher Hooper:** Apparently

**Ali Leonard:** World Series. Back with the

**Tyram:** town.

**Ellis Taylor:** sake, but he knows the word penis as well and talks about it quite

**Justin Hale:** then uh Christina was watching a legal video

**Luke Neverisky:** Interesting.

**Justin Hale:** earlier and they said subpoena

**Ali Leonard:** sportsman

**Justin Hale:** and

**Ali Leonard:** down. And now she gets the American Girl book, Your Body

**Ellis Taylor:** often. Yes.

**Ali Leonard:** and You. I'm sure I still have my copy of Mom and Dad's House. I'll send it to

**Justin Hale:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** Everyone's

**Justin Hale:** uh made the mistake of uh

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Justin Hale:** saying, "You guys got to stop crawling over me. You're hitting me in the junk. how she asks what

**Ellis Taylor:** favorite

**Justin Hale:** everyone's junk

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. I mean, everybody's got a different

**Justin Hale:** is and that that's kind of what sparked all of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** this.

**Ali Leonard:** joke. At least she's respectful about

**Tyram:** Could be worse.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, very

**Ali Leonard:** it. There are things you want to

**Ellis Taylor:** these

**Justin Hale:** true.


### [00:20:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, how's everyone doing? Everyone

**Tyram:** Heck

**Luke Neverisky:** I think we're

**Ellis Taylor:** guys.

**Justin Hale:** Born

**Christopher Hooper:** ready?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** ready. Yep. South the womb.

**Christopher Hooper:** You were born

**Tyram:** yeah. We've got some dragons to

**Justin Hale:** Ready to go.

**Christopher Hooper:** ready.

**Tyram:** contend with, it

**Luke Neverisky:** ready.

**Christopher Hooper:** Wow.

**Ali Leonard:** do.

**Tyram:** seems.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that sounds

**Justin Hale:** Where are

**Ali Leonard:** Like he didn't invent

**Justin Hale:** you? That's entirely up to you,

**Tyram:** Sounds like a real harrowing encounter, if I do say so

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Baby

**Justin Hale:** sir.

**Christopher Hooper:** dangerous. What's that?

**Ellis Taylor:** is the winner.

**Christopher Hooper:** All right.

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, um, last we left

**Tyram:** myself.

**Christopher Hooper:** off, um, we had

**Ali Leonard:** dream of a reality.

**Christopher Hooper:** a little conversation with Bafael on the ship,

**Ali Leonard:** One of our ice trucks.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, where he really he really he really put y'all through the ringer, if I have to say so myself, questioning your ethics and, you know, what you're really doing,

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** you know. Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** no, we couldn't

**Christopher Hooper:** and you know, I think I think it was a healing uh

**Ellis Taylor:** possibly

**Christopher Hooper:** experience where everyone reflected on their on their beliefs and what they're actually trying to do. Um, and importantly, there was an arm wrestling uh competition that served as an immaculate distraction for a sensor relay. um sabotage and not only sabotage but uh what pirating or what would you call when you like hijacking of the sensor uh signal

**Ali Leonard:** We hacked the main frame and that's really all you need to

**Tyram:** They did the

**Ellis Taylor:** Yep. Beep. Boop.

**Justin Hale:** We

**Christopher Hooper:** you hack the main frame. Exactly. Yeah. Boop

**Ali Leonard:** know.

**Tyram:** clackity clack, you know, on the computer pieces and just, you

**Ellis Taylor:** Boop.

**Christopher Hooper:** boop as a racist does and

**Tyram:** know, she's not just a racist. She's an

**Christopher Hooper:** uh bada bing bada boom

**Tyram:** artificer and a paladin, which is not relevant, but she is an artificer.

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** done. I think I mean she's a paladin to her engineering beliefs,

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. So, it's like on

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Ali Leonard:** minor and and then it's all

**Christopher Hooper:** If my understanding is correctly, your paladin nature is your extreme devotion towards engineering.

**Ali Leonard:** connected. Got to go fast. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Oh, kinderg being Sonic the

**Ali Leonard:** His name is

**Tyram:** Hedgehog. Only the

**Luke Neverisky:** Don't need a

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. His name is Tony and he's a real god.

**Ali Leonard:** Tony. And he's he's definitely a real god and not just a

**Tyram:** Hedgehog.

**Luke Neverisky:** headshot.

**Ellis Taylor:** Sounds like a

**Justin Hale:** sounds like a cult. If

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** It's definitely

**Ellis Taylor:** cult.

**Justin Hale:** you if you have to preface that it's not a cult, it's usually a

**Ali Leonard:** cult. You guys said it

**Tyram:** I mean, if

**Justin Hale:** cult.

**Ali Leonard:** wasn't a cult and it was fine. So that's what I'm going on the belief

**Tyram:** we can't believe people who might be in a cult, who is there to believe in? You

**Christopher Hooper:** Y'all

**Ali Leonard:** of.

**Christopher Hooper:** think Y'all think everyone who's religious is

**Tyram:** know, I don't think um I don't think Olivia's cultish.

**Christopher Hooper:** cultish? Beldorans, the

**Ali Leonard:** vector in the

**Tyram:** She's like the most laxidasical paladin I've ever seen about Fis.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, she's like I mean we had that

**Christopher Hooper:** Tonius. Yeah, she is barely religious.

**Ali Leonard:** orange this

**Ellis Taylor:** conversation in the beginning toer. I was like, she's going to be barely

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Paladin was a choice,

**Ali Leonard:** weekend driver

**Tyram:** Jesus

**Ellis Taylor:** religious.

**Christopher Hooper:** but you know, it's fine.

**Ali Leonard:** that's 60 58 years of

**Ellis Taylor:** She's culturally tier.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and

**Ali Leonard:** age

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. I feel like your devotion is towards justice.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yeah. And so by

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, which aligns with uh

**Ali Leonard:** couple. It's like when your

**Tyram:** Christ.

**Ellis Taylor:** proxy, that's how Keith

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** parents are Methodist and you're like, I guess I'll be

**Ellis Taylor:** calls himself culturally Jewish. Like going to go to temple.

**Ali Leonard:** Methodist.

**Ellis Taylor:** But he's Jewish.

**Christopher Hooper:** and channel devotion is kind of just like a you

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Tier

**Christopher Hooper:** know I guess I'm devoted.

**Ellis Taylor:** gets it. We've got it. We got to figure it

**Christopher Hooper:** Um I am an agent of tier but we don't need to do a bunch of ceremony around it.

**Ali Leonard:** Watch the

**Tyram:** Sorry.

**Ellis Taylor:** out. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, leave that to the clerics.

**Ali Leonard:** event today was fast.

**Ellis Taylor:** Exactly.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so yeah, that was great. Um, and then y'all landed at the crash site and um, Toeer the DM supplied a really cool uh, battle map from Chepoku of the

**Ellis Taylor:** Just

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, Luna the Fallen Moon. And that's one of my favorite battle maps I've ever found. And that's why I shoehorned it in

**Luke Neverisky:** Hell

**Ellis Taylor:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** to this plot.

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah. I love

**Ellis Taylor:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and uh, we did a ritual at

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** the Crown of Luna, and I feel like we learned some

**Justin Hale:** Nothing. Not a

**Christopher Hooper:** things. Did we learn some things up there,

**Tyram:** like Luna's

**Ellis Taylor:** She's talking. We learned that much.

**Christopher Hooper:** too? Okay, there was some

**Tyram:** alive even though she's a skeleton. I guess that's something we learned.

**Justin Hale:** thing. Learning is for chumps.

**Christopher Hooper:** talking. Yeah, there's a little bit of a weak

**Tyram:** Um, so yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** She's We're going to try to revivify

**Christopher Hooper:** presence there. Um,

**Tyram:** I feel like we should try to talk to Luna. It should be something on the uh something on the agenda

**Ellis Taylor:** her.

**Tyram:** today for sure. If f****** revivify works, then that all these f****** uh monks have really overstressed the amount of work that needed to be done

**Christopher Hooper:** and I

**Tyram:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** mean what uh what level monk gets

**Tyram:** Well, they don't. Then riff rify also specifically says you

**Christopher Hooper:** revivify?

**Tyram:** have to do it within like a minute of them dying. Uh but if we had like raise dead, which I don't think anyone

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Is she dead though?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Isn't raised dead like raising as

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, she

**Ellis Taylor:** Is she dead

**Christopher Hooper:** a

**Tyram:** does. I don't know. We we can literally ask her. So yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** can communicate, right?

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that's true. What if she was just sitting on like one

**Tyram:** we can we can get to the bottom of this. Or rather, I should say Silus and Brew can

**Christopher Hooper:** hits hit point, you know, just

**Tyram:** get to the bottom of this since, you know, we got the world's greatest detectives on the site.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, thank

**Justin Hale:** What what is death really? You know, when it really

**Christopher Hooper:** needed

**Ellis Taylor:** though? Hey, bud.

**Justin Hale:** comes How do you

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. What is death to a god?

**Luke Neverisky:** God.

**Justin Hale:** quantify or qualify death in this scenario?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and speaking of uh interacting with godly beings to your own bodily detriment, um,

**Ellis Taylor:** better than

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** y'all did the rebinding spell on the orb.

**Ellis Taylor:** you've

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and y'all rolled really well, like most of the time. um except for Luke or rather uh Toeer playing and rolling as as Luke as uh Liliana. Um and

**Ellis Taylor:** disgusting

**Christopher Hooper:** I think like you're what uh you're

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, then I should detract that from

**Christopher Hooper:** missing some health points I

**Luke Neverisky:** my character sheet.

**Christopher Hooper:** believe. I think it's on your character

**Ellis Taylor:** demon.

**Christopher Hooper:** sheet. Are you missing health

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Yeah. 45 out of

**Christopher Hooper:** points? Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** 57.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And I think you were the only one that was damaged

**Luke Neverisky:** Awesome. You know, that's honestly I'm glad

**Christopher Hooper:** during the ritual, so appropriate.

**Luke Neverisky:** none of my friends got hurt.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and that should teach everyone who ever skips out on a lesson. I will

**Luke Neverisky:** So, never f****** leave

**Christopher Hooper:** kill you or hurt you while you're gone. Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** us

**Ellis Taylor:** cold. Character is not safe while you're gone.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Tyram:** I mean, I always assume that. That's why I try to never

**Luke Neverisky:** again.

**Christopher Hooper:** um yeah.

**Tyram:** miss.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um and so you completed the ritual and the last

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** thing you uh you heard were shouts from the

**Justin Hale:** Damn.

**Christopher Hooper:** ship as people said, "We got a live one." and you saw um uh ropes uh firing up into the air, catching hold of an adult blue dragon flying above you. Um and that's where we'll start. Um so I think if you want to do any communing, uh it will be under duress. Uh let's see. We're going to do we're not going to go into initiative order unless y'all want to. Um, but who would like to act

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm gonna immediately summon Bob

**Christopher Hooper:** first? All right, you're summoning Bob. We'll put we'll put you we'll put you up front here. So, you're summoning

**Ellis Taylor:** just

**Christopher Hooper:** Bob. Uh, what are you what are you doing? What do you think uh you're doing along

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm hopping on him and trying to

**Christopher Hooper:** with

**Ellis Taylor:** figure out how we can get up in the air to attack the

**Tyram:** Like how far the

**Ellis Taylor:** dragons.

**Christopher Hooper:** that? Yeah, good

**Tyram:** dragon's like up above the the surface of the ocean,

**Christopher Hooper:** question.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. How far up are they?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, that's a

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** great question. So, they are high above

**Tyram:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** you, but probably only they are flying like they're probably let's see. So, the ocean wall is

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** about 300 ft. So, they are skimming just above that. Um, so they're they're

**Ellis Taylor:** okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** flying very low because because you're you're kind of the the point of interest. Uh, which is why the grappler grappling hooks were able to to reach them. Um, actually, uh, you know, Olivia, go ahead and give me a perception

**Luke Neverisky:** Don't do

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. It's so

**Justin Hale:** Do it. Do

**Christopher Hooper:** the five? You notice a little bit there's an anchor coming off the ship and that and you kind of see that and it's like that's

**Ellis Taylor:** much.

**Christopher Hooper:** on.

**Luke Neverisky:** grew up sheltered and uh um you know

**Ellis Taylor:** one.

**Luke Neverisky:** she's not a risk taker and decision

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, that was my feeling

**Luke Neverisky:** her decision to do the wall effect was out of was weird for her.

**Ellis Taylor:** She

**Tyram:** Okay. Okay. Um, Silus is um is going to be like rude and um are Livia or Ellmith still within like u range of me? Like how far away they are they from me right now?

**Christopher Hooper:** too. Um, they've run ahead to the water wall. Um, so they're just about to enter. Uh, they're

**Ellis Taylor:** probably

**Christopher Hooper:** probably uh they're probably about 90 ft

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, I'm going to

**Christopher Hooper:** away

**Tyram:** move closer to them with my 30 foot move speed here. And then I'm going to try to teleport and just like velcro myself to probably Olivia because she's stronger. And then just kind of like go up with

**Christopher Hooper:** now.

**Tyram:** them.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, cool. for that. Um, why don't we do uh another

**Ellis Taylor:** for both of

**Christopher Hooper:** dexterity saving

**Ellis Taylor:** us. Or should I do a strength jack to see if I catch him? Or if he's just teleporting and grabbing onto my

**Christopher Hooper:** throw? Um, yeah. I I think with that I think with that five perception you you don't see him

**Ellis Taylor:** straps.

**Christopher Hooper:** behind him behind you. You are like

**Tyram:** What? I don't need her to do anything. I can

**Christopher Hooper:** just like well I got a life so I'm going to float to the

**Tyram:** just stick to her. I have my spider

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool. You have a Velcro

**Christopher Hooper:** top.

**Tyram:** climb thing. I can just stick to

**Ellis Taylor:** ability. Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, you just need

**Ellis Taylor:** okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** to the the dexterity saving throw is to get to her before she

**Tyram:** her. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** launches into the

**Tyram:** Um uh

**Christopher Hooper:** air. Yep. Cool. Um, yeah. So, DC16, uh, you, uh, uh, fully wrap around her with your, uh, spider climb

**Tyram:** 19

**Christopher Hooper:** stuff. Um, Liliana, you have a life vest. You shoot up ahead. Peru, want to give you a chance to act before I hurt

**Ellis Taylor:** You know

**Justin Hale:** So, we're we're in the water,

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Uh,

**Tyram:** I think everyone but you is

**Justin Hale:** right? Oh, so I So, we're trying

**Tyram:** now. Well, I'm trying to just get

**Justin Hale:** to get in the water. Is that what the case is

**Tyram:** out of the the firing range here. So yeah, I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** what?

**Christopher Hooper:** no.

**Tyram:** uh like suddenly Olivia just feels like a

**Justin Hale:** then?

**Tyram:** halfling's weight like sticking to her back, I

**Justin Hale:** Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, so uh to re to reexlain the the setting, right? So, there is this um fallen Luna. She uh around her

**Tyram:** guess.

**Justin Hale:** okay. All

**Christopher Hooper:** is uh completely dry ocean bed and then

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** a wall of ocean. And so everyone is running towards one of the walls of the ocean and floating up with their life

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, I have a question. Is anyone

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** vest right

**Ellis Taylor:** running? Oh, never mind. You've got an

**Christopher Hooper:** now. Um, yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** idea.

**Justin Hale:** So, um

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm going to let Brew finish. Go

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** I'm gonna do stupid artific. I'm gonna throw out the um the cannon and I am


### [00:40:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead.

**Ellis Taylor:** What

**Justin Hale:** going to use the cannon's force ballista to propel me up the wall of water. I'm I'm going to go into the water and then use it to propel me forward or

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, awesome. Okay, cool. Uh, let's see. Uh, give me some sort of role for that. Um, I'm going to say, what do you think

**Justin Hale:** upward.

**Christopher Hooper:** for that?

**Ellis Taylor:** are you talking

**Christopher Hooper:** either like a spellcasting role or a

**Ellis Taylor:** about?

**Christopher Hooper:** um or some sort of like uh basically the ability to like like how well and how effectively are you like aiming this thing to be like

**Justin Hale:** Do you want it to be int based

**Christopher Hooper:** a propulsion device through the

**Justin Hale:** for like calculation style or

**Christopher Hooper:** water. Uh yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think that makes sense. Maybe just an arcana check

**Tyram:** What the

**Justin Hale:** what? Okay, I can do

**Tyram:** heck?

**Justin Hale:** that. Uh 23. I don't get any pluses from anybody with that, right? Yeah. 15 plus

**Christopher Hooper:** like. How much damage was that? 25. And you're like

**Tyram:** 25. Yeah, I got the attack

**Christopher Hooper:** within range of an ally. 5 ft from an ally. If is that include sneak attack? Okay,

**Tyram:** in. I had it already. Oh, I can do nowhere near 25 damage without sneak attack. Uh, I'm going to use my bonus

**Christopher Hooper:** great.

**Tyram:** action to throw a psychic dagger towards the surface of the water to try to get out of the ocean here real quick. All right,

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool. Okay,

**Tyram:** so I need to roll a five or better to actually get up there. Um, I rolled a

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Thanks.

**Tyram:** five. All right, so um I teleport up to the surface of the ocean. Um, I guess I'll think at Olivia, but I think psychic phone is still going. I am no good in water. Good luck. Bye. And I'm out. That's my

**Ellis Taylor:** So Olivia is like 50 ft underwater,

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. Uh,

**Ellis Taylor:** right? Cool. Just

**Christopher Hooper:** yes. Yes, she is.

**Tyram:** turn.

**Ellis Taylor:** below

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm gonna I'm going to use a different stat block than War for Soldier. Um, okay, great. Um, one of the uh one of

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** the one of the remaining knights, the only remaining knight is going to stab into this dragon as well. Uh, miss and miss. Okay. So, next in the order, uh we have Liliana. So, so Silus, you just end up uh you have enough movement

**Tyram:** enough for the teleportation. I actually haven't

**Christopher Hooper:** to make it to the surface of the water then,

**Tyram:** used my move yet. Is there anything around me that I could like swim to that would be worth swimming to?

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Um let's see. How

**Tyram:** All of it. I haven't used my move yet. Well,

**Christopher Hooper:** much movement do you have left? Okay, then

**Tyram:** I Well, um I guess I would have to be like I'd have to roll a swim check,

**Christopher Hooper:** you're you're close enough to get to the water or Oh, I think it's just what like um if you want to I

**Tyram:** right?

**Ellis Taylor:** No. So

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like you are close enough to the boat. Um if you

**Tyram:** Okay. Okay. The worst I could do on

**Ellis Taylor:** bad.

**Christopher Hooper:** want to if you want to get to the boat otherwise

**Tyram:** athletics is a 13, if that makes any difference.

**Christopher Hooper:** you do. Okay. So, um it's basically, uh I think you can get to the boat. Um I think you'd need a 15 or better to

**Tyram:** Okay, I'll give it a

**Christopher Hooper:** get on board. I'm not saying

**Ellis Taylor:** to help

**Christopher Hooper:** that getting on board is a good thing to do, but if you wanted to get on

**Tyram:** shot. Uh, I feel like it's at least then I wouldn't

**Ellis Taylor:** me. is the

**Christopher Hooper:** board Okay,

**Tyram:** be like just bobbing in the water. So yeah, I I I want to get some things solid

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Tyram:** under my feet, I think. But if he blows up the boat, you know, egg

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** on my face, but

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, man, it'd be really dumb to be caught

**Tyram:** yeah. Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** in the water. Um, you'd have to be a real idiot to do that.

**Tyram:** I got a 18 on my athletics, so I to

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, speaking

**Tyram:** uh pull myself up under the

**Christopher Hooper:** of All right, awesome. Um, speaking of

**Luke Neverisky:** water. That's me. I'm an idiot in the

**Christopher Hooper:** some of the idiots in the water, Liliana, it's your

**Tyram:** boat.

**Luke Neverisky:** water. Um, so I know um the rules with regards to like leveled spells can't do two the same turn.

**Christopher Hooper:** turn.

**Luke Neverisky:** All good. What about if it's a if it's a charge for my mandolin? Does that count as a leveled spell even though it's listed as a

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh. Uh, is it is it a leveled

**Luke Neverisky:** spell?

**Christopher Hooper:** spell? Like does it have a level a

**Luke Neverisky:** So it's appearing. So for example, I want to cast fly as a part of the mandolin. It appears as a third level spell, but it doesn't say cast. It just has one

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, it's a

**Christopher Hooper:** level?

**Luke Neverisky:** charge,

**Justin Hale:** it's a charge on the item itself.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. And and sorry, what was the what was the thing that you're checking against

**Luke Neverisky:** right? So, if I wanted to do that and then cast a leveled spell as a bonus action like a heal or something like that, then

**Christopher Hooper:** that? Oh, uh yeah, we have um because you're not using a spell slot, the rule we we generally run

**Luke Neverisky:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** is you can only use one spell slot. So, yeah, you can totally do

**Luke Neverisky:** awesome. Then I'll cast flying myself. Uh well

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Luke Neverisky:** actually I am what 50 ft to the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you're you're on the

**Luke Neverisky:** surface surface. Okay, great. In that case I'm going to cast

**Christopher Hooper:** surface of the water.

**Luke Neverisky:** fly. Um and then I

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Okay,

**Luke Neverisky:** will get above Oh, I already used that. Okay, I'll I'll do that. Um, let me cast fly and I'm going to get out of the water and just

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Luke Neverisky:** kind of levitate like above the boat like I don't know maybe like 5t or something just so I'm not like touching the boat but I am on top for more better a better word. Um, so I will move

**Tyram:** I'm going to get Liliana. I guess she gets another

**Luke Neverisky:** myself right here.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, great, great, great, great, great.

**Luke Neverisky:** And then as a bonus action, I'm going to cast healing word on

**Tyram:** one.

**Luke Neverisky:** myself. Um, which I can handle. And that'll be the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** end of my

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, great. Um, great.

**Luke Neverisky:** turn. I need it. I'm f******,

**Christopher Hooper:** You need it.

**Luke Neverisky:** dude. I'm dying over

**Justin Hale:** Oh, please

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Justin Hale:** let me catch phrase for this campaign

**Christopher Hooper:** bird

**Tyram:** words

**Christopher Hooper:** things. Little bird things. Um,

**Tyram:** are so f****** whiny. I swear to

**Christopher Hooper:** Olivia Olivia,

**Luke Neverisky:** here.

**Ellis Taylor:** Why? I'm just floating in water,

**Christopher Hooper:** uh strength saving throw

**Ellis Taylor:** right? No,

**Christopher Hooper:** here. You're trying to hold on to the dragon,

**Ellis Taylor:** I was sitting on Bob and essentially Silus was holding Bob to the dragon. And now that Silus is

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. What you Okay, but are you trying to hold on to the dragon or

**Ellis Taylor:** No, no, no. I mean, I was holding on to Bob this whole

**Christopher Hooper:** no?

**Tyram:** like Well, I feel like Bob It's not completely hopeless that Bob stays

**Ellis Taylor:** time. The only reason I stayed on the

**Tyram:** on the

**Ellis Taylor:** dragon.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay. So, I kind of treat you and Bob as the same thing.

**Tyram:** dragon.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, um

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I'm gonna go with no. If I knew he's going deep, like no, I'm not staying on. We're We're jumping ship, too.

**Justin Hale:** physics

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** question. If the rate at which the dragon is sinking is

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** rapid, would that then create suction on the top of the dragon, thus causing downforce on Bob to keep him going down

**Luke Neverisky:** teacher. Do we have homework?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Oh

**Justin Hale:** with the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, actually, no, because

**Christopher Hooper:** they don't die from barometric pressure.

**Tyram:** God damn. So, we can't use the Godzilla minus one

**Justin Hale:** time. Fair.

**Christopher Hooper:** So from

**Tyram:** method to try to blow up this dragon.

**Christopher Hooper:** bids um only if you plan for it uh like a session ahead of time and it become it's like a truly rot plan. Um, okay.

**Tyram:** That was a good movie. But that is exactly how that scene played out.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** Hallelujah.

**Christopher Hooper:** but um, okay,

**Ellis Taylor:** No,

**Christopher Hooper:** Olivia, you are not you're saying you're not trying to stay on the dragon

**Ellis Taylor:** Silus. I'm not going down an extra

**Christopher Hooper:** this. Uh, okay. Cool.

**Ellis Taylor:** 100 feet like can't

**Christopher Hooper:** And

**Ellis Taylor:** be. Actually, quick question. What's the movement in water? Is it slowed or just your same

**Luke Neverisky:** Is it a half?

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool.

**Luke Neverisky:** What's half? Maybe

**Christopher Hooper:** I think it's

**Ellis Taylor:** movement? I tried googling it real quick and it was

**Christopher Hooper:** I I think it's half

**Justin Hale:** Water is considered rough terrain, right? So we

**Luke Neverisky:** not.

**Ellis Taylor:** unclear.

**Christopher Hooper:** um I believe so just going to check real quick. Yes, half that's right. Unless you have an

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** explicit move the swim ski. Okay, cool.

**Justin Hale:** have

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. So, we'll say that Silas um dragged you down with him. Um, the like 50 ft

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** below the water. Um, that's where you are right now.

**Justin Hale:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you feel this whoosh. What,

**Justin Hale:** said you can say it, but does it

**Christopher Hooper:** Justin? Um, I don't know, but you could say it. Uh you feel this like whoosh of water go by you. Um and

**Justin Hale:** happen?

**Christopher Hooper:** uh and the boat um you hear this like loud under the boat. Uh and then we'll go to Elizabeth.


### [01:20:00]

**Ali Leonard:** Cool. So I heard So she heard the boat. Do I see something happen to the boat? Yeah, I'm just looking at the

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, you're in the water, right? You see the boat just kind of like almost lift a

**Ali Leonard:** boat.

**Christopher Hooper:** bit and then just like you hear

**Ali Leonard:** That's probably not good.

**Christopher Hooper:** this and then it comes back

**Tyram:** So, I'm on the boat. Do I like

**Ali Leonard:** Just kind of like

**Christopher Hooper:** down.

**Tyram:** feel the boat move underneath me or

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah, for

**Tyram:** anything? Don't love

**Christopher Hooper:** sure. And you feel like this like impact under

**Tyram:** that. Not a fan. Not a fan of these.

**Ali Leonard:** woodwise cool. Um Okay. But that's really all I see, right? Just kind of boat and nothing else. Just ocean. I saw a dragon in

**Christopher Hooper:** it. The water. You did see it. You did

**Ali Leonard:** it at one point. Yeah. And now it's gone.

**Christopher Hooper:** see a dragon dive into the

**Ali Leonard:** So, um I guess I'd go try and get

**Christopher Hooper:** water. Yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** on the boat. I don't feel

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** safe, but I feel like what else is there to do except except everybody's trying

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yeah. It seems like everybody's getting on the boat.

**Ali Leonard:** to get on the f****** boat, so it's like kind of the cool kid thing to do, you know? And I'm always kind of about that

**Christopher Hooper:** So like

**Justin Hale:** Silus keeps

**Ali Leonard:** life.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** screaming I'm on a boat for some

**Ali Leonard:** Um, for some reason, it's not that and he's doing kind of like the Rose and Jack pose and I'm like, you're alone. What are you

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Don't you ever

**Ali Leonard:** doing? How? So, this is

**Christopher Hooper:** forget.

**Justin Hale:** reason.

**Ali Leonard:** a big boat though. Theoretically, if I wanted to go under the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You

**Ali Leonard:** boat, I have two

**Christopher Hooper:** could especially depending on your cons

**Ali Leonard:** a plus two. What if I took a really

**Christopher Hooper:** score.

**Ali Leonard:** big

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** breath? And I kind of just wanted to check out the damage under the boat.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I would love to do

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. You want to give me an

**Justin Hale:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** Great. Uh, give me an

**Tyram:** be

**Ali Leonard:** 17. Yeah. Even

**Justin Hale:** She'll give you an investigation. You won't even be ready for

**Ali Leonard:** better.

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice.

**Justin Hale:** it. Told you. Told you you

**Ali Leonard:** 23. What about them

**Christopher Hooper:** investigation. 23

**Tyram:** We'll accept your

**Justin Hale:** weren't

**Christopher Hooper:** 23. Okay.

**Tyram:** surrender now.

**Ali Leonard:** apples?

**Christopher Hooper:** You you go under this boat

**Justin Hale:** ready.

**Christopher Hooper:** and you see the boat in this battle

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** map is not accurate because

**Tyram:** To

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** remember 1950s era.

**Ali Leonard:** Right.

**Christopher Hooper:** You see under the boat, it has a steel uh underbelly. Um and it has a a few remember you motortored out here. This

**Ali Leonard:** It's a

**Christopher Hooper:** is a motorboat. There's some motors under there. Um, but right in the middle of that steel under underbelly, there's like a dent from something

**Ali Leonard:** motorboat.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh big. Um, but it's holding. It looks like it's holding. It looks like the engines are okay. They're not on right now. Don't know whose that problem is. Um, and you see a bunch of bubbles. You see a bunch of

**Ali Leonard:** kind of down.

**Christopher Hooper:** bubbles. Yeah. Down and like

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, sure. Okay. Well, I'll tell everybody there's no hole

**Christopher Hooper:** around.

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Great. Um, good, good, good, good, good. Uh, okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Good. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** So Ally, I really like

**Ali Leonard:** sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, never mind. Nothing happens to

**Ali Leonard:** Uhhuh. Well, now I'm going

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Nothing. Don't worry about

**Tyram:** But he told you not

**Ali Leonard:** to worry about it. I know, but now I'm going

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, you have explicit instructions not to worry

**Ali Leonard:** to

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** about

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I think you could do a smidge more if you were so inspired. Otherwise, we'll move to

**Tyram:** to.

**Justin Hale:** What you going to

**Ali Leonard:** Um I don't really

**Christopher Hooper:** brew with all

**Justin Hale:** do?

**Ali Leonard:** have

**Christopher Hooper:** that

**Ali Leonard:** inappropriate that was

**Christopher Hooper:** ass. Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** inappropriate. I'm assuming that was of the

**Christopher Hooper:** sorry.

**Ali Leonard:** people that would have up in brew that said that in the in the group you

**Christopher Hooper:** I think I think you're hearing like the screams of people

**Ali Leonard:** had. What are you gonna do with all that

**Christopher Hooper:** on board and they're like going

**Tyram:** Do you George

**Luke Neverisky:** Oops.

**Ali Leonard:** ass? Sure. Sure. Sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** crazy.

**Tyram:** Knights think of anything else?

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. And then I'm actually gonna Misty's step. Can I mist step

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Jesus.

**Ali Leonard:** up to on top of the box?

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Normally, you need to see

**Ali Leonard:** I need to be able to see. I know. I kept thinking it's like I need to be able

**Christopher Hooper:** where you're

**Tyram:** Can I visualize the the

**Ali Leonard:** to know what it looks like for me in my

**Tyram:** landing spot and like relate it to it

**Christopher Hooper:** missing. Um,

**Tyram:** psychically?

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Ali Leonard:** brain. I'm gonna splinch

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm going to say for my own sake, no. Um, okay. But you can you can probably get back up to the

**Ali Leonard:** myself. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll make my way downtown.

**Christopher Hooper:** surface. All right. Cool. All that in your

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** jeans, Brew, you're

**Justin Hale:** So, can I use Well, first of all, I'm still in the water. Can I Can I see the

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Justin Hale:** dragon? And then I can't see the dragon

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. No, you can see a

**Justin Hale:** anymore. Damn

**Ali Leonard:** I told you about those

**Christopher Hooper:** bunch of bubbles, but you don't see the

**Justin Hale:** it. Okay. Um, so that trick's not going to

**Ali Leonard:** bubbles.

**Christopher Hooper:** dragon.

**Justin Hale:** work. While I'm still in the water, can I use the momentum of my

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** cannon to to catapult me onto the

**Ali Leonard:** That's the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Give me an art

**Ali Leonard:** advantage to doing it. The disadvantage is you don't

**Justin Hale:** boat? Yeah. 18. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** check. 18.

**Ali Leonard:** have

**Christopher Hooper:** Wow. Um, okay. Yeah, you like propel yourself out of the water and as you're like getting out of the water and getting up like it's kind of it loses

**Ali Leonard:** sliding

**Christopher Hooper:** its you're now fighting against gravity a lot more than you were before. Um and uh but you are able to make just the ledge. You grab on you pull yourself on and you're right at the ledge

**Tyram:** Oh my

**Justin Hale:** Sure. Okay. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** of the boat.

**Tyram:** god.

**Justin Hale:** in in everyone else's head, I I think that's how this work, right? We can talk to everybody, not just uh the dragon's totally gonna come back and and go through the bottom of this boat. We got to get out of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Ali Leonard:** sign of in that number one

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** guitar back there.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Sorry, I'm going to mute you, Ally,

**Justin Hale:** actually, I was going to do this to the dragon. Can I do

**Christopher Hooper:** again.

**Justin Hale:** it to the boat instead?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Justin Hale:** Is the both considered

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, set it on

**Justin Hale:** an

**Christopher Hooper:** fire. Um,

**Justin Hale:** object? Um, enlarge

**Christopher Hooper:** what are you what are you trying to

**Luke Neverisky:** Answer.

**Christopher Hooper:** do?

**Justin Hale:** slashred. Uh,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, what level spell is it?

**Justin Hale:** level two.

**Christopher Hooper:** Level two. Uh,

**Justin Hale:** I was going to make the boat bigger

**Christopher Hooper:** which which way are you going? You going bigger or

**Justin Hale:** because it increases its

**Christopher Hooper:** smaller? Okay. Um, yeah, you could do that.

**Justin Hale:** strength or should I make it smaller so

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah, you could do

**Justin Hale:** we can get the hell out of here

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Luke Neverisky:** I think the dragon will probably be able to

**Justin Hale:** faster?

**Tyram:** Is the boat even capable of moving right now? Has we wrecked

**Luke Neverisky:** find us if it's still small. That's a good

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so what you got from Ellsworth

**Tyram:** that?

**Luke Neverisky:** point.

**Justin Hale:** I thought she said the

**Christopher Hooper:** was was she's gonna unmute herself in a

**Justin Hale:** fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** second. She's not going to mute herself.

**Justin Hale:** Nope.

**Ali Leonard:** Paints were fine when I saw them below

**Christopher Hooper:** She's going to

**Ali Leonard:** the boat, but they're not on for some reason.

**Christopher Hooper:** say the engines are fine.

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** That's right. No one has turned them

**Justin Hale:** okay. Did you say that to

**Christopher Hooper:** on. I

**Justin Hale:** us? No, no, no. Did Elizabeth say that to the rest of us? Like, do we know that? Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** did. It was inferred through psychic

**Justin Hale:** I heard the the boat was fine part. I didn't hear that the engines were off. Okay. Um, looking at the boat

**Christopher Hooper:** phone.

**Justin Hale:** and the people that are on it, if I'm to make it smaller, would everyone still be able to fit on

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Uh, how much

**Justin Hale:** it? It makes it one size smaller.

**Christopher Hooper:** smaller?

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Do I want to do that?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Making smaller. If we're including the boat, that will include the engines, by the


### [01:30:00]

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. No. Um, no. I want to make it bigger. Reducing seems to make everything worse. I'm going to make it

**Christopher Hooper:** way.

**Justin Hale:** bigger. Ah,

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. A damn.

**Tyram:** unless

**Justin Hale:** I made the right

**Tyram:** he's playing games with

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. All right.

**Justin Hale:** choice. Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** You're gonna make it bigger. Okay. Um, you you cast your enlarge spell and you see the board everything just stretching. Um, which is great because I would hate to make the sounds of uh all the sailors under underboard getting crushed.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. So, I make it bigger that

**Tyram:** Wow.

**Justin Hale:** uh it has advantage on the strength checks and saving throws if the dragon so chooses. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** Awesome.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Justin Hale:** and then I'm going to run down and see if I can get the engine running. Or I'm going to I guess I'm going to run that direction since we're in initiative

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. All right. Okay. You uh you head below decks um and you start looking for the engine room. Um, cool. We'll go to Olivia, who we're gonna skip her

**Ellis Taylor:** That's I'm going to use Bob's

**Justin Hale:** order.

**Christopher Hooper:** because she is doing

**Ellis Taylor:** 60 foot movement and just dash and get to the

**Christopher Hooper:** something. Okay, cool. Get to the surface. You have enough to get on the

**Ellis Taylor:** surface.

**Christopher Hooper:** boat.

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, dragon. Um, it's at this point. Well, let me let me roll something first. Okay. Okay, cool. And then we'll roll something

**Justin Hale:** Why don't you uh why don't you roll something

**Christopher Hooper:** else. Okay. Okay. Um, I I'll

**Justin Hale:** first?

**Christopher Hooper:** I'll ask I'll ask you all this. Um, would you rather the dragon attack people or attack

**Justin Hale:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Justin Hale:** assumed just me that it was going to attack

**Luke Neverisky:** I think I prefer the

**Justin Hale:** the

**Christopher Hooper:** boat? You

**Tyram:** We are stranded. here for a little while. I'm actually kind of interested in

**Christopher Hooper:** prefer the

**Tyram:** going back down and talking to Luna anyway, so I wouldn't be that upset about

**Christopher Hooper:** boat.

**Luke Neverisky:** boat. Yeah. Take the

**Justin Hale:** boat.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Um. All right. So, uh, Brew, as you're getting closer to the engines,

**Tyram:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** um, it seems like it is you hear, uh, you hear something outside the engine room. Um, and uh let's

**Justin Hale:** My video jumping to you

**Christopher Hooper:** see.

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, it's not terrible. Little little lost, but the internet

**Christopher Hooper:** All right.

**Justin Hale:** guys.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, it sounds like something is tearing at um around the engines

**Justin Hale:** Oh, well that doesn't

**Christopher Hooper:** now. Um,

**Justin Hale:** sound great. Not cool. You're just going to leave me with that?

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Yeah. Bow night

**Justin Hale:** Rude.

**Christopher Hooper:** turn. It's bone knight

**Tyram:** I thought I was before the

**Luke Neverisky:** There's blood

**Justin Hale:** Rude.

**Tyram:** night.

**Christopher Hooper:** turn. No, you are after

**Luke Neverisky:** lantern.

**Christopher Hooper:** most of the knights. All right. Uh there's still a night stuck on this little buddy, but you don't know that. Um, and the rest of the knights are shooting down into the water. Um, missing terribly. All right, Silus, you're

**Tyram:** Um, am I aware that the like he that there's something over near the

**Christopher Hooper:** up. Give me perception check.

**Tyram:** engines?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, actually with Brew uh in psychic phone, I think

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** you know. Yes.

**Tyram:** Um, okay. So, I go over near the um the engines. I have blind sense out to 10 ft. Does that mean that I can attack this dragon even though I can't see it and still not suffer from a disadvantage?

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh you you don't have like um it's between the boats between you,

**Tyram:** I'm saying I'm like running over to the edge of the boat where the engines

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Um let's see. Um, I'm going to say you can attack with

**Tyram:** are. Even though not theoretically not being able to see it shouldn't

**Christopher Hooper:** disadvantage

**Tyram:** make any difference for

**Christopher Hooper:** here. It's not even about whether you can see it. It's about leaning over the side and like attacking it like while trying to get it an

**Tyram:** me. Oh, I'm just going to jump over the railings and straight

**Christopher Hooper:** angle off the side of the

**Tyram:** down if that that's what I need to

**Christopher Hooper:** boat. Okay. Yeah.

**Tyram:** do. Um, I'm trying

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, so you jump into the

**Tyram:** I'm picturing this as like I jump over the railings and attack while I'm still in midair, you know? All cool

**Christopher Hooper:** water. Nice. All right.

**Tyram:** like. All right. Um, so still

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Go

**Tyram:** disadvantage stick. All

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead. No, with that. No, that's

**Tyram:** right. So, I'm going to throw the first dagger. I don't think I have advantage, so we'll

**Christopher Hooper:** fine.

**Tyram:** just see if I can hit it. Uh, 20. Sorry, 22. All right, no sneak attack, but

**Christopher Hooper:** It

**Tyram:** I still get to do uh damn it. Uh just six

**Christopher Hooper:** hits. Uh, six damage.

**Tyram:** damage then with my bonus action. Now I do have a damage because I've mixed

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Nice.

**Tyram:** it. Uh 19 sick. All right. So, I get sneak attack on this

**Christopher Hooper:** That's the

**Tyram:** one. Getting my dice. All right. Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** AC.

**Tyram:** better 23 damage on that attack.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, nice.

**Tyram:** Okay. And then I guess I just splash in the

**Christopher Hooper:** Wow. Um, yes, you do. Um, you immediately

**Luke Neverisky:** Dang.

**Tyram:** water.

**Luke Neverisky:** Wait.

**Christopher Hooper:** feel uh what's your AC?

**Tyram:** Um 18. I can

**Christopher Hooper:** 18.

**Tyram:** use reaction to add to it if he's doing like a

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** a attack

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh he's doing an attack roll. He rolled with

**Tyram:** roll. Never f******

**Christopher Hooper:** uh 30 total. Okay. Um uh does 17 slashing and two lightning damage. Uh, slamming you into the

**Tyram:** mine. I'm going to uncanny dodge to half the

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** side of the

**Tyram:** damage. Um, let's start. It was a total of 19 you

**Christopher Hooper:** boat. Okay. Nice. That's

**Tyram:** said. Okay. So, round up or round

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** down? Okay. I guess I I guess I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, run

**Tyram:** picturing I kind of like managed to like cushion myself before getting like smashed into the boat or

**Christopher Hooper:** down. Yeah. Safety

**Tyram:** something. It's f****** something,

**Christopher Hooper:** position. Uh yeah,

**Tyram:** right?

**Luke Neverisky:** All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** Liliana, you're

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, dragon visible from the top of the boat, right? No. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** up. No, but you're flying

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, I Yeah, that's right. All right. And this is over

**Christopher Hooper:** above the boat,

**Luke Neverisky:** there. Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** so you can see it. It's under the boat. It's attacking

**Tyram:** Guys, it's

**Luke Neverisky:** cool. I'm gonna

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus.

**Luke Neverisky:** move to I'll move there. So that's 10 ft. So I

**Tyram:** here.

**Luke Neverisky:** can see Okay, so I can see them now if I'm moving kind of the butt of the boat.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. What's your health,

**Tyram:** Um, I'm still that was the first hit I've actually taken um since we long rested. So, I'm still at

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus?

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, what's everyone else in the hub look

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** like? How bad a shape are we

**Christopher Hooper:** You are by far

**Tyram:** 50.

**Luke Neverisky:** in? Okay,

**Ellis Taylor:** I have a feeling I might have forgotten to apply damage. Didn't we

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Luke Neverisky:** cool. We got 30 lightning to open

**Ellis Taylor:** get like 30 30

**Luke Neverisky:** up.

**Ellis Taylor:** earlier? Yeah.


### [01:40:00]

**Ali Leonard:** You and

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, that's we didn't

**Ellis Taylor:** That's right. So, never

**Ali Leonard:** I didn't cuz we were in the water.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. All

**Christopher Hooper:** worst.

**Luke Neverisky:** right. I'm going to Oh, man. All right. I'm going to risk it for a biscuit here. Um All right.

**Ellis Taylor:** mind.

**Luke Neverisky:** Can I'm gonna try to cast Polymorph from the dragon.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay. All right. What's the DC

**Luke Neverisky:** Wisdom

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Wisdom 17. Huh? Um, it

**Luke Neverisky:** 17.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh it seems like you you cast

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** it and it starts to to form and you see it

**Luke Neverisky:** should have

**Christopher Hooper:** let out a

**Tyram:** I mean, hey, making it

**Luke Neverisky:** known. All

**Christopher Hooper:** using one of its legendary

**Tyram:** burn those is not a bad

**Luke Neverisky:** right. That's true.

**Christopher Hooper:** resistances.

**Tyram:** thing.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um All right. Um so question. If I'm concentrating on fly and I cast polymorphis concentration, do I break concentration even though it was successful for a second? I think so.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay, cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. Uh what do you what do you want to happen? You wanted to break concentration,

**Luke Neverisky:** I don't want like I would like to keep flying but I realize polymorph is a concentration spell and so I'm guessing the fact that I even

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Oh, yeah. Casting in the in the first

**Luke Neverisky:** That would Yeah. Okay, cool. No longer from

**Christopher Hooper:** place. Yeah. would break it. And how how high up were you

**Tyram:** Does it make any difference that the

**Luke Neverisky:** I see

**Christopher Hooper:** flying? Oh,

**Tyram:** fly spell was done through the loot? Probably not,

**Luke Neverisky:** five

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. No.

**Tyram:** right? Being able to double up on concentration would be pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** No.

**Tyram:** f******

**Luke Neverisky:** coming. That mandolin is way too

**Christopher Hooper:** That is too

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** crazy. All right.

**Tyram:** like, got the

**Luke Neverisky:** nice. All right, that is

**Christopher Hooper:** juice.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** bit.

**Christopher Hooper:** anyone um, do people feel like their positioning is

**Tyram:** I never

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I haven't even been

**Christopher Hooper:** accurate on the on the map? Anyone who can see it?

**Tyram:** was able to log on to D and D beyond I've given up now.

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. I can um can present if you

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, yes, I think

**Ellis Taylor:** looking.

**Ellis Taylor:** math. No.

**Luke Neverisky:** failed.

**Christopher Hooper:** DC. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** action. That's

**Tyram:** lay on hand is not a

**Ellis Taylor:** But you could do

**Christopher Hooper:** only 5 ft. Never

**Ali Leonard:** and I need you to know

**Christopher Hooper:** mind. But you can actually pull them towards you. You can actually shove

**Ali Leonard:** that. Um I don't think that's helpful. So I'll

**Christopher Hooper:** towards you, which is interesting. It's only

**Ali Leonard:** miss you step and then I'll lay on hands. So then

**Christopher Hooper:** five feet.

**Ali Leonard:** you're

**Christopher Hooper:** So,

**Luke Neverisky:** That's better

**Ali Leonard:** up only by 10 though.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Now, I I I think that you all think I'm a mean DM, but would a mean DM let us bend the rules by allowing you to

**Ali Leonard:** I thought messy stuff

**Christopher Hooper:** misty step and lay on hands in the same turn? I think

**Tyram:** That's completely legal. It wouldn't require you to bend the rules at

**Ali Leonard:** is or lands isn't a

**Christopher Hooper:** not. Technically, technically Misty Step is can only be cast as a bonus

**Tyram:** all. You can always tag in a bonus action for your action. That's You can

**Christopher Hooper:** action. So, it's technically

**Tyram:** always download

**Ali Leonard:** spell.

**Christopher Hooper:** technically you technically you cannot, but because I am

**Tyram:** it.

**Luke Neverisky:** He's a generous

**Ali Leonard:** Thank you,

**Christopher Hooper:** a nice DM, I say you can

**Tyram:** Wait, why were you misspecting? Were you not

**Ali Leonard:** generous DM. Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** because I am very generous.

**Tyram:** like already on the deck there?

**Luke Neverisky:** guy.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. She had

**Ali Leonard:** you. I wasn't on the deck.

**Ellis Taylor:** to get onto the

**Ali Leonard:** I had to get on the boat and

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** boat.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, cuz I know y'all want to paint me as a bad

**Ali Leonard:** move.

**Christopher Hooper:** guy, but clearly I allow you to do two bonus

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, does she have can did she have to dash to get on the

**Christopher Hooper:** actions uh in the same turn,

**Ellis Taylor:** boat?

**Ali Leonard:** I had to get on the boat,

**Christopher Hooper:** which

**Ali Leonard:** which is an which is a

**Christopher Hooper:** no, she had to get on she just had to use her movement to get on the boat. But technically in the rules, you cannot use two bonus actions even if one is in place of your action, which is real

**Ellis Taylor:** So

**Christopher Hooper:** stupid. Um, I'm just saying that

**Ali Leonard:** movement.

**Christopher Hooper:** because a lot of people like to point fingers and I think we should all just say that I'm very kind.

**Ellis Taylor:** H. Okay, Toeer.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, but that is your full turn and Brew is

**Ali Leonard:** Sorry.

**Christopher Hooper:** unconscious and I would like you to make a death saving throw. For you see, I'm kind.

**Justin Hale:** Okay, that's a

**Luke Neverisky:** First of all, how dare you


### [01:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, that is a

**Ellis Taylor:** Does does my order of devotion extend to saving

**Justin Hale:** seven.

**Ellis Taylor:** throws to death saving throws or or

**Luke Neverisky:** I just

**Ellis Taylor:** protection or is it just checks? I need to look at

**Christopher Hooper:** failure. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't know.

**Ellis Taylor:** that. No, wait. That's features and traits. Wrong

**Luke Neverisky:** think

**Christopher Hooper:** of protection. I don't even see

**Ellis Taylor:** place.

**Christopher Hooper:** it in your actions, but it's a feature. It's

**Ellis Taylor:** It just says plus three to saving

**Christopher Hooper:** probably passive. Okay. Well, that's the

**Ali Leonard:** model

**Christopher Hooper:** answer.

**Justin Hale:** What was the

**Ellis Taylor:** throws. That's not helpful. Does

**Ali Leonard:** recent wall.

**Christopher Hooper:** Sure. Yeah, it includes death saving

**Ali Leonard:** He couldn't go to the right

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah, they have. They've done

**Tyram:** far. Oh, wow. Okay, never mind. What would these assholes do if we weren't here? They'd be

**Christopher Hooper:** eight,

**Ellis Taylor:** going to cast aid um at third level on Liliana and Brew and you guys get 10 hit

**Christopher Hooper:** up. Uh what's the what's uh about aid? Do

**Justin Hale:** Come back

**Christopher Hooper:** you need to be in sight, in range, and

**Justin Hale:** up.

**Ellis Taylor:** feet. Doesn't need to be touching it. 30 feet in range. And I don't need to see them. It doesn't say anything

**Christopher Hooper:** it's even better to save your

**Justin Hale:** now.

**Tyram:** hours.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yes. As a DM.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes. And

**Christopher Hooper:** friend.

**Ellis Taylor:** then and then I'm going to that's my action. So and I don't know where the dragon

**Tyram:** The the

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** is. So I am just going to cast. He's right over the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, you have a pretty good idea where it

**Tyram:** the dragon is not being subtle right now. It is currently pitting me against the

**Ellis Taylor:** edge. Oh, okay. He's just

**Tyram:** f******

**Ellis Taylor:** over I think it's Ellis trying to balance baby.

**Tyram:** boat.

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, I'm just going to use my bonus

**Christopher Hooper:** is.

**Ellis Taylor:** action to cast on my magic on my weapon and make it magical. So, I get a plus two whenever I actually go attack

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Ellis Taylor:** it because I am move closer to

**Tyram:** Oh, it's a mid point. Those are both spell

**Ellis Taylor:** weapon. Maybe. I don't

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh,

**Tyram:** slots. You can't cast it regardless. It's a a second spell slot.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** again.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** You've already used the spell slot this turn.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, that's right. Well, I thought it was a bon

**Tyram:** bonus action and action is

**Ellis Taylor:** it was a bonus action, which is why I was doing it, but I guess you can't do two of

**Tyram:** irrelevant when it comes to spell slot

**Ellis Taylor:** those. Never

**Christopher Hooper:** and

**Tyram:** usage. Oh, but if you

**Ellis Taylor:** mind.

**Christopher Hooper:** doubly because it's already a magical

**Tyram:** wanted to do lay on hands of some or on yourself or someone else, then that's not a

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yeah,

**Tyram:** spell. So, you could do that if you wanted

**Ellis Taylor:** I'll I'll lay I'll lay hands on

**Christopher Hooper:** boat and driving their swords into this thing, stabbing away. Silus, you're doing great. It's your

**Tyram:** Okay. I'm like pinned up against the uh the side of the boat, right? But I'm like up against the side of the

**Christopher Hooper:** turn. You're not pinned. You were just slammed against the side of the boat.

**Tyram:** boat, right? I turn around and I just walk up the side of the boat since I

**Christopher Hooper:** So, yeah.

**Tyram:** can spider climb. Um, and

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** then like hanging sideways, I'm going to try to pelt him with my daggers

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay. So, you're

**Tyram:** again. And yeah, I can just use my normal move action just to

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Gotcha. Cool. Go ahead.

**Tyram:** walk up the boat sideways. And I vexed him last time,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** so I still have

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. And you have uh if you consider uh the St. George

**Tyram:** advantage. That's true. So, I definitely

**Christopher Hooper:** Knights as allies, they are all over that

**Tyram:** have a sneak attack no matter what. I do hit, but damn, I was really hoping for a crit. All

**Christopher Hooper:** thing.

**Tyram:** right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, I do 31

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** What are

**Christopher Hooper:** nice. Um, yeah, really good attack.

**Tyram:** damage. Uh, psychic daggers

**Luke Neverisky:** you?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you're throwing daggers at

**Tyram:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** them. You see the dragon like writhing as these um knights are stabbing at it. Uh, and your dagger pierced them right in the neck. Uh, cool.

**Tyram:** My second attack is going to come now.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, is that your second attack,

**Tyram:** Bonus

**Christopher Hooper:** too?

**Tyram:** action. Uh, hit 19. Total 28, right? So, yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** Um, but unfortunately it's just the weaker attack this time. Uh, it's another seven

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** damage. Okay. And I'm not going to just like walk along the side of the boat around the corner to kind of get out of his line of sight

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool. Okay,

**Tyram:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. In that uh after that you see the dragon turn and uh and disappear and then you see a rush uh you can tell movement in the water as this as some invisible force is diving deep below the water. Um all right Liliana it's your turn.

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh boy. Um, so Bruce towards the I know he's below decks and I'm guessing is that where the stairs are down? Like how do I get down below

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah, there's um there's a hatch. Uh you can just rush down if you

**Luke Neverisky:** decks? Okay. Um, I'm going to rush down there. And if I open the hatch, can I see

**Christopher Hooper:** want. Um let's see. Uh I think you can

**Luke Neverisky:** Brew?

**Christopher Hooper:** use what's your movements 30.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, think so.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um is there any way you can use your b uh bonus action for movement at all or or

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Uh, I was going to use bonus for healing. So, if I have to like dash or something, I can do that.

**Christopher Hooper:** healing? You can you can dash to make it to to

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Um like adjacent to him. Oh, it doesn't really

**Christopher Hooper:** him. Um within

**Luke Neverisky:** matter within sight. Okay. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** sight

**Luke Neverisky:** I will uh Oh, actually, how does this work? Inspiration. Okay. So, I have a bonus action. So,

**Christopher Hooper:** basically

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm going to Who else has temp HP? Is it just Well, nobody now, I'm guessing.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um I don't I don't know of any

**Luke Neverisky:** Right. Okay. Right. I think it's just me.

**Ellis Taylor:** That was

**Christopher Hooper:** source of temp

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. They Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** me. The whatever I had,

**Christopher Hooper:** HP.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. All right. So, I'm gonna

**Ellis Taylor:** right? I guess what he's thinking of.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, that was hit point max.

**Luke Neverisky:** use um I want to think I want to use Mantle of Inspiration. I'm just trying to see if I can It is a

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Bic Inspiration die, so I'm guessing that counts as a bonus action. Oh, yeah. It's there. Okay. Um All right. B inspiration die roll a d.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Nice. All right. every assuming I can see everybody which I know I can see Brew and I know I can see Olivia and Elizabeth and I don't know about

**Christopher Hooper:** So they're on different decks.

**Luke Neverisky:** Silus, but if I'm opening the hatch and I can see Brew below deck, can

**Christopher Hooper:** So So you you had to go below deck. The reason why it

**Luke Neverisky:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** took your movement and an action is because you had to go like go to

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh,

**Christopher Hooper:** a hatch below deck and then zig zig through the below decks

**Luke Neverisky:** okay. Okay, that makes sense. Then

**Christopher Hooper:** to reach buu in the engine

**Luke Neverisky:** I will not Now you're

**Ellis Taylor:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** room. Sorry, I got a shortcut

**Luke Neverisky:** good. Um, all right. In that case, Brew is just going to get a pretty high level healing

**Christopher Hooper:** there.

**Luke Neverisky:** word.

**Ellis Taylor:** okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool. Limit HP

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** 23. Very

**Luke Neverisky:** 23. All right. Um I think that's it. Hopefully you can like do something this combat, you

**Justin Hale:** there. Thank you.

**Christopher Hooper:** nice.

**Luke Neverisky:** know. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Luke Neverisky:** Sorry.

**Christopher Hooper:** Ellip, it is your turn and it's you're really

**Ali Leonard:** I don't love that. So, can I still see the bubbles of where he went down or

**Justin Hale:** all.

**Ali Leonard:** can I just assume

**Christopher Hooper:** quiet. You are you are on deck. You could poke your head over if you wanted to and give me a perception check if that's what you wanted to do with your

**Ali Leonard:** he's my other question before I do that

**Christopher Hooper:** turn. Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** is so there's an engine room. Is there a ste like like the room where you steer and you actually turn on the boat up on top of deck? Like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, steering is on the other side.

**Ali Leonard:** a is it like a boat with like a key where you actually turn

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, there's like

**Ali Leonard:** it on up deck because that's where Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** a Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** I want to go

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah. So, you hop into uh what's the the captain's court the the captain's steering room basically at the front of the um uh

**Ali Leonard:** there.

**Christopher Hooper:** at the front of the boat. Um and you see in front of you like there's a key like left in in the engine. Um and no one's in

**Ali Leonard:** I'm going to put in the second phone. I'm going to turn

**Christopher Hooper:** there.

**Ali Leonard:** on the

**Tyram:** I mean, he's about to

**Ellis Taylor:** do it. He

**Ali Leonard:** engines. How do we feel about

**Ellis Taylor:** did. He said earlier no one turned them on. So

**Ali Leonard:** this?

**Tyram:** die.

**Ellis Taylor:** they might not be broken. They might just not be on.

**Ali Leonard:** Well, I figure if they're on, then if the dragon hits the boat, he'll hit the engines and he'll get

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I like it. There's ores. We can always use ores to get home. It'll take a long

**Ali Leonard:** hurt. Either way, he's going to get f***** up. He's going to f****** the boat. The boat might as well f*** him up.

**Christopher Hooper:** It happened. All right, you

**Tyram:** That'd be so embarrassing for this dragon if he just dies

**Christopher Hooper:** starting the

**Tyram:** like a manatee.

**Ellis Taylor:** time.

**Christopher Hooper:** engines. A poor

**Tyram:** Honestly, yeah, that makes me super sad. I hate that that happens to manities.

**Christopher Hooper:** manatee. Um um you you crank you you crank that

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.


### [02:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** ignition and uh you hear the choke and the engine catch and uh down

**Tyram:** f***.

**Christopher Hooper:** in the engine room you start to hear the as it's starting up. Um, and you hear in that room, you hear comms of other boats and they are saying, "There's more dragons coming in. There's more dragons. They're coming in for the south. Prepare. Prepare. Let's get in movement." Um, and uh, you're hearing these radio. Hey, we read you loud and clear.

**Ali Leonard:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** We're moving around. It looks like the original blue dragon is down is down in the water. We have lost sight. We are coming down to the south. Um and uh that's what you hear around you. Are you doing anything else? Uh El

**Ali Leonard:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Smith, you probably have maybe a bonus action if you

**Ali Leonard:** just saying over psychic phone what the radios are saying. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** want. Okay,

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Brew, you are conscious there. You hear engines thrumming. Um, it looks like you only hear one of two engines running.

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** Congratulations.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, there's Liliana standing over you like an angel. Um, what are you doing?

**Justin Hale:** Um, with my amazing perception, do I know what engine's not

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um do you know what engine is not running?

**Justin Hale:** running? Yeah. You said you said one

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. With your um what is your passive

**Justin Hale:** engine's others aren't. Okay. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** perception? 18. With your passive perception, you're able to look at the engine on the right and the engine on the left, and it looks like one has all its timing belts and everything running, and the other one is not doing anything or making any noise. And you think that

**Ali Leonard:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** maybe the left one is probably not

**Justin Hale:** 18. I'm a little hesitant, but I think Yeah, maybe. Maybe that's right.

**Ali Leonard:** pretty.

**Christopher Hooper:** running.

**Justin Hale:** All right, I'm gonna go uh I'm gonna go look at that engine. See if I

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, go ahead. Give me an arana

**Justin Hale:** can fix it. You want arana?

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** You

**Justin Hale:** Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** uh can tell that the bottom of it has been smashed in and is currently blocking um gears and s*** that are in an

**Justin Hale:** 16. Well, there's your problem.

**Christopher Hooper:** engine.

**Justin Hale:** Um, does it do I know if there's any chance of being able to cobble something together to fix this quickly to make

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes, but

**Justin Hale:** it just like operable?

**Christopher Hooper:** it's going to it's going to happen next turn

**Justin Hale:** Okay, that's

**Christopher Hooper:** probably. Um

**Justin Hale:** fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** yes, let's uh return to that. Um, Olivia, uh, unless there's anything else you wanted to do. I think that was that was most of it. Okay, Olivia, you

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's

**Christopher Hooper:** are on deck. Uh, you've seen the dragon dive into the water with a few um,

**Justin Hale:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** Dragonites and um,

**Ellis Taylor:** So, it's

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. And you're up there by yourself now,

**Ellis Taylor:** gone. Uh,

**Christopher Hooper:** actually.

**Ellis Taylor:** well, I know that there are more dragons coming, so I'm going to stay on deck, I guess. Get ready for more. Wouldn't we talk about ready in action? Like, yeah. Can we do that? I feel like there were

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. You an aridian

**Ellis Taylor:** some sort of funky rules where like we couldn't do that.

**Christopher Hooper:** action. Yeah. Um, no. I'm a generous DM. I will let

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** you use the rule ready and

**Ellis Taylor:** I don't know. Well, so I want to do I just want to like sit there like watching the skies, holding my axe, ready to just like smash any dragons that

**Christopher Hooper:** action. Okay. Yeah. Give me a perception

**Ellis Taylor:** come. Real dice. Real dice. We don't trust

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Ellis Taylor:** you. Oh, 18 plus zero.

**Christopher Hooper:** 18 plus zero. Um, yeah, just just basically on the other side of this like I don't know what you want to call it, vortex like empty empty ocean part. You see that they're uh to

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** the south are these two boats and they are heading straight towards these approaching winged figures. Um they can just make out their silhouettes that are

**Ellis Taylor:** and it looks like the boats and the dragons are kind of on a

**Christopher Hooper:** approaching.

**Ellis Taylor:** course for each other. The dragons aren't heading for us.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah, they

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** are heading for you, but they're going through the boats first, it looks

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. I'll relay that to everyone and then I will touch

**Christopher Hooper:** like.

**Ellis Taylor:** myself again.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And um and where are you touching

**Luke Neverisky:** Are we doing

**Ellis Taylor:** Um um you know

**Christopher Hooper:** yourself? Okay. Great.

**Ellis Taylor:** gently I'll myself

**Christopher Hooper:** Awesome. Um all

**Luke Neverisky:** freezing?

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** You continue to hear very little. It's eerily quiet. Silus, it's your turn. Which is great cuz you just walked away. Is

**Ellis Taylor:** Then wait with ready in action. Do I get to do it as soon as

**Christopher Hooper:** it snack

**Tyram:** Sorry, I had to deal with my cat. What's

**Ellis Taylor:** they like come in?

**Luke Neverisky:** It's an

**Christopher Hooper:** time? Oh, good. It's your turn. Um, with ready action, you set a trigger and I assumed your trigger was

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yes, that's my trigger.

**Christopher Hooper:** dragons being in reach uh when you will use your check.

**Tyram:** up? Um

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. And I'm allowing you to do that not just because it's in the rules, but because I'm a kind

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I there was something that we tried. Yeah, I don't know what

**Tyram:** You say it often enough, it'll eventually be

**Ellis Taylor:** it was. That's hides what

**Christopher Hooper:** DM.

**Luke Neverisky:** The recording shows

**Ellis Taylor:** my memory is saying. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. It's my goal.

**Tyram:** true.

**Luke Neverisky:** that is a time

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, do I see the dragon that dove under the

**Luke Neverisky:** DM.

**Tyram:** water here?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, no you don't. Uh, if you want you can look harder for your

**Tyram:** Okay, I'd have to use my action for it

**Ellis Taylor:** fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** action. Yeah.

**Tyram:** then be able to do anything I want to be able to do anything

**Christopher Hooper:** You have to act actively search for it. Yeah.

**Tyram:** meaningful afterwards then. So there's really no

**Christopher Hooper:** That's what That's what

**Tyram:** point. Yeah. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** I was

**Tyram:** Um, I guess I'm going to think at the uh at the rest of the party here. Um, if we're going to book it, do we want to like throw a sending stone down to Luna to see if like we can

**Christopher Hooper:** thinking.

**Tyram:** talk to her through it? Bro, you

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, sure. I

**Tyram:** have that one for useless Victor, right? We can just go get to Victor's on the other end and try to talk to her that way.

**Luke Neverisky:** mean, it's not

**Justin Hale:** Uh

**Tyram:** Okay. So, something to

**Luke Neverisky:** useless.

**Ellis Taylor:** Sure.

**Justin Hale:** yes, that does work.

**Tyram:** think about as we flee here. Um, and then, um, I'm going to climb back up on deck. I'm going

**Ellis Taylor:** Who's cut the best athletics to try and chuck it at

**Tyram:** to I'm going to climb back up on deck, trying not to be within a straight

**Ellis Taylor:** her? Probably

**Tyram:** line of anybody else in the party here. And um I guess I'll already in action myself to throw a dagger at any dragon that gets close enough for me to throw a dagger

**Ellis Taylor:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. And because I'm a kind DM, I will allow you to ready and action.

**Tyram:** at.

**Ellis Taylor:** The kind DM is being an awful

**Tyram:** Thanks. The third lie

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right, Liliana, uh, you're

**Justin Hale:** Oh.

**Tyram:** is to convince yourself.

**Ellis Taylor:** bully. I'll just

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Ellis Taylor:** keep saying it and it'll become true. That's how the world works,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Sadly, that actually does work all too

**Ellis Taylor:** right? It

**Luke Neverisky:** Um

**Ellis Taylor:** does.

**Luke Neverisky:** um how big is our

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh-huh. It's huge

**Luke Neverisky:** boat? What is that huge

**Tyram:** often.

**Luke Neverisky:** class? Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** now. It's huger than the huge class, which I think is

**Luke Neverisky:** jeez.

**Christopher Hooper:** only bigger than big.

**Ellis Taylor:** So, I mean, do we have like a freaking Royal Caribbean cruise ship now? Huge

**Christopher Hooper:** It's um you kind of went from like you kind of went from like a like a like a

**Ellis Taylor:** class.

**Christopher Hooper:** shrimp boat to a like I don't know crab boat I think is a little bigger or like A Alaskan

**Tyram:** All the campaigns


### [02:20:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** cruise boat.

**Tyram:** inevitably converge upon us creating cruise

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Yes. I was kind

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** ships.

**Luke Neverisky:** No.

**Ellis Taylor:** of hoping that we were going to run across uh not Olivia, Dne's like elderly cruise ship and they were going to help us out of the water. It's still going

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Now I hope y'all don't run into

**Tyram:** I'm trying to remember the name of the the cruise ship. It was like forest something, right? Or

**Christopher Hooper:** them.

**Tyram:** something forest. That's it. That's

**Ellis Taylor:** hard. No, it was Haven. Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um I thought it was Haven.

**Ellis Taylor:** Haven. It's self

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** sustaining. They never have to

**Tyram:** right.

**Luke Neverisky:** trying to see. So, the spell hallucinatory terrain doesn't actually change

**Ellis Taylor:** dock.

**Luke Neverisky:** the it's not like a

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Luke Neverisky:** It just changes the like texture of a terrain I think if I'm reading this correctly. Make a

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. To like you can make it velvet

**Luke Neverisky:** natural. Yes. I guess I cannot I guess I'm trying to discern

**Christopher Hooper:** or

**Luke Neverisky:** if what I can do is to cast this notori like underneath the like around the boat to basically act as camouflage uh from below. Um, but I don't think that's the intent of

**Christopher Hooper:** something.

**Luke Neverisky:** this bill because it says the pond can maybe be seen like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope or a rock stream gully like a wide and smooth road, which makes me think that I'm not creating an illusion per se. The tactile characters in the train. No. All right, never mind.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, all right. Then in that case, I'm going to uh What's my health? What's my health? Six. I should heal myself. Uh, I too will touch

**Tyram:** These these St.

**Luke Neverisky:** myself just all over. Just

**Ellis Taylor:** All the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Uh, were you touching

**Tyram:** George Knights are rubbing off on you guys in the worst possible

**Luke Neverisky:** really all over.

**Ellis Taylor:** ladies.

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** What did you

**Luke Neverisky:** there. I That was enough cast

**Christopher Hooper:** Jesus.

**Luke Neverisky:** wounds. That was like a fourth level cure uh

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, of

**Tyram:** use? Does it add 2d8 for every level you go up

**Luke Neverisky:** cure wounds.

**Tyram:** or something?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, it was an 88 plus five.

**Ellis Taylor:** Please.

**Luke Neverisky:** is is

**Luke Neverisky:** juice. You

**Christopher Hooper:** juice. Elizabeth, you're up. You're in the

**Justin Hale:** that juice.

**Ali Leonard:** Um, since I know more are coming, but we only do I know that we only have one engine? I'm assuming I do just based on monitors and lights. There's like one that's like like in a pod race it's

**Christopher Hooper:** wheelhouse.

**Luke Neverisky:** guys, that's

**Ali Leonard:** like and one that's like for the

**Luke Neverisky:** not

**Ali Leonard:** engines like in the pod

**Ali Leonard:** Great. What if Ellsworth

**Christopher Hooper:** slowly at this

**Ali Leonard:** is very familiar with the

**Christopher Hooper:** point.

**Ali Leonard:** documentary Deadliest Catch?

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, then

**Ali Leonard:** You're right. You know what? You're right. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** she would have rolled higher on that arcana check. That

**Ali Leonard:** true. I would have been Well, she didn't

**Christopher Hooper:** would have been the explanation.

**Ellis Taylor:** H. Did all of us watch that show? I loved

**Ali Leonard:** watch it close enough, apparently.

**Ali Leonard:** Northwestern.

**Ellis Taylor:** don't remember their

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, that's the only one I

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** names.

**Ali Leonard:** remember. A lot of them, the captains would die and then you'd be sad because you're like, "Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Smoking and

**Ali Leonard:** yeah." Because smoking and drinking and

**Ellis Taylor:** drinking, staying up for multiple hours, multiple

**Ali Leonard:** drugs. Oh, right. You do

**Tyram:** How much duct tape do you

**Christopher Hooper:** unless All right.

**Tyram:** have? Just

**Justin Hale:** this. One can never have too much duct

**Tyram:** make a propeller out of duct tape.

**Justin Hale:** tape. What you guys don't realize is the the the pee hole has uh just unlimited

**Christopher Hooper:** So

**Justin Hale:** amounts of duct tape.

**Tyram:** It's in the item description. Yeah, just endless

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, well that's how it works. Um all right. So, um, unless you have a something specific, I'm going to say a fairly high arcana

**Tyram:** tape.

**Christopher Hooper:** check, um, of 20 uh, with, um, there are different like failure states here if

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** you don't make that or you can do an athletics check of 16.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I think I'm better with

**Ellis Taylor:** Do you want to call Olivia down to just bang

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** bits and bobs.

**Justin Hale:** Arona.

**Ellis Taylor:** it?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yep. Yep.

**Justin Hale:** Both

**Ali Leonard:** Remember

**Justin Hale:** God, I'm officially out of Flash of Genius.

**Luke Neverisky:** You have burning

**Christopher Hooper:** juice.

**Justin Hale:** inspiration, too. Okay, good. I've got two rolls. Um, the

**Luke Neverisky:** inspiration.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** plus the plus three, they doesn't matter on this check,

**Christopher Hooper:** No, not a sitting

**Justin Hale:** right? Okay. What's the

**Luke Neverisky:** Excuse

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** What's the bar juice mod?

**Christopher Hooper:** there. D8.

**Justin Hale:** D8.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** Let me indictate this one. Okay, let's do this. Oh, 19. Perfect.

**Luke Neverisky:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** Wow.

**Justin Hale:** Okay, plus a board. That's 30 19 21 22 22 plus 8 makes a 30, my friend.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um so you see around you um you have lots of duct tape and so one of the ways that you can

**Justin Hale:** Mhm. So

**Christopher Hooper:** undent something is to get something super sticky

**Justin Hale:** much

**Christopher Hooper:** and pull out the dent. And so you're able to

**Luke Neverisky:** Please.

**Christopher Hooper:** basically stick a huge glob of duct

**Ellis Taylor:** Do they touch each

**Christopher Hooper:** tape and then pull a lever on it and pull

**Ellis Taylor:** broken car

**Christopher Hooper:** out the dent. And after that happens, you hear the a huge like kick as it kind of backfires, letting out this like huge pressure buildup. Um, give me a dexterity

**Ellis Taylor:** into

**Christopher Hooper:** saving throw.

**Justin Hale:** Snap the plus three work here. Okay, good. Deck save. Okay. 15

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. Okay,

**Justin Hale:** 17 uh

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Hey Lis, can you take this top side? Let's say

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Okay,

**Justin Hale:** I did that before I did all the engine

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Justin Hale:** crap.

**Christopher Hooper:** And um you know, now it's not eerily quiet because you hear two engines going.

**Luke Neverisky:** can. Nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** Olivia, you're

**Ellis Taylor:** Uh, I guess Liliana is not here with this ending

**Ali Leonard:** Great.

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm a Lex.

**Ellis Taylor:** stone.

**Christopher Hooper:** up. Nope.

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, just going to like look at the dragons, make sure they're not coming any closer, and then like look over the side and be like, "Blue dragon not coming

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah. Give me a perception

**Ellis Taylor:** back." Can we say I'm investigating the waters for a

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Tyram:** If we left right now, would we be abandoning those George guys who

**Ellis Taylor:** dragon? Dang it.

**Christopher Hooper:** No.

**Tyram:** were on the dragon?

**Ellis Taylor:** I have a feeling they did

**Ali Leonard:** I mean, I haven't left. I'm just moving the

**Justin Hale:** That' be

**Ellis Taylor:** dead.

**Christopher Hooper:** 11. Um, you see a a dark figure.

**Ali Leonard:** engines.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, it seems small from this perspective coming up

**Justin Hale:** fun.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** from the water. Um, off from the distance, it looks like the dragons and the boats are engaged um in combat. Um, cool. Uh, you could do a little bit extra if you want or hold keep holding that

**Ellis Taylor:** I'll just keep holding that action. I have a feeling it's coming back. I'll just keep I'll I'll be

**Christopher Hooper:** action. All right.

**Ellis Taylor:** staring down the water watching this dark thing coming at us ready to

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, cool. Um, Silus, you're

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, if Rude thought that about the uh the orb, I'm going to try to uh go back up to the top deck and uh what what would

**Ellis Taylor:** attack.

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Tyram:** you make me roll to try to chuck the orb down to uh Luna?

**Ellis Taylor:** the

**Justin Hale:** the

**Tyram:** Not the orb. The orb. The the sending stone. I

**Ellis Taylor:** orb. Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Tyram:** sorry. Sorry. Wrong wrong setting entirely. The sending

**Ellis Taylor:** stone.

**Christopher Hooper:** so um

**Tyram:** stone. Isa here. Not

**Christopher Hooper:** athletics uh you are

**Tyram:** over here. Isa

**Christopher Hooper:** getting

**Tyram:** here. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** um we can we can use him for this I

**Justin Hale:** stone.

**Tyram:** because like I am not suited for this and he is

**Christopher Hooper:** think if you two want to do it together, I think that that's the only way this is going

**Tyram:** like okay I will uh try to get

**Christopher Hooper:** to work. Uh,

**Tyram:** with like oh hey I'm glad you finally found your contacts which you had lost um we're going to try to chuck the orb not the orb the stone down to Luna

**Christopher Hooper:** well,

**Justin Hale:** Bring it

**Tyram:** ascending stone that connects us with Victor sending stone down

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Tyram:** to


### [02:40:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. The DC for this is really high because you're you're to start you're already 30 feet or

**Justin Hale:** off.

**Christopher Hooper:** 300 ft above the ocean floor on

**Tyram:** Luna. Well, 300 feet

**Christopher Hooper:** top of being um, you

**Tyram:** down, right? So that the 300 feet is kind of irrelevant. We just got to get it

**Christopher Hooper:** know,

**Tyram:** horizontally over

**Christopher Hooper:** Right. Um it is uh even down you're it's it's getting over to where it's if you want to do strongest by its head. You can probably get a weak signal at least by um you know the rest of the

**Tyram:** enough.

**Christopher Hooper:** skeleton. Consider also the boat has started to

**Tyram:** Okay. So, what do we need to

**Christopher Hooper:** move away. Um, so I'm going to set the DC here. Um, baseline to get to the skeleton 15. Um, which

**Tyram:** get?

**Christopher Hooper:** is not that bad, but that is the bare

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** minimum. Um, to get a strong signal, we're going to

**Tyram:** Um Okay. Um, you said

**Christopher Hooper:** say 25.

**Tyram:** that um, me and Omar are doing this together. How does that

**Christopher Hooper:** So, we'll do a tag team roll here. So, you'll both roll and you'll take the

**Tyram:** work? Okay. All right. Um, I, uh, well, I'll this seems like a good time for me to use my bar juice if I need to. All right. Okay. Never f******

**Christopher Hooper:** best.

**Tyram:** mind. There's no possible way I could beat that. Actually, I could possibly beat that, but there's no point. All right. All right. Um, I'll see if I get an AT

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Let's see if you get a natural

**Tyram:** 20. Sure. I didn't, but

**Christopher Hooper:** 28. I can't believe I

**Tyram:** um I'm actually really glad I didn't get an AT 20 there because that would have been honestly

**Christopher Hooper:** rolled that. That's

**Tyram:** pretty frustrating to waste it on that. But

**Christopher Hooper:** ridiculous.

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Says, "Oh, let me help you out." and takes it and just like pro baseball arc and form just like right next to um the ritual site like right in there it says

**Tyram:** Great

**Christopher Hooper:** just like my playing

**Tyram:** job, Ma. Oh no, your contact lens just fell out

**Christopher Hooper:** days oh my goodness

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um all right and um

**Tyram:** again.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think at this point uh we are going to exit combat.

**Justin Hale:** I didn't

**Tyram:** We almost got that dragon. That dragon survived us.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Tyram:** We didn't survive the

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** um that's true. Um

**Justin Hale:** die. Yes.

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** very true. Uh part of being an intelligent creature is

**Justin Hale:** Second.

**Christopher Hooper:** knowing when to leave. Um, and you see uh that shadow that's heading

**Tyram:** dragon.

**Ellis Taylor:** a

**Christopher Hooper:** towards you um is one of the dragon knights and you see it rise to the surface and and then

**Ali Leonard:** Are they

**Christopher Hooper:** behind it you see two other

**Ali Leonard:** dead? Okay, then I don't need to turn back.

**Christopher Hooper:** figures they're

**Ellis Taylor:** a Oh, we're

**Ali Leonard:** Then I don't need to turn this hunk of junk

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, I guess we'll just No, we fish their bodies

**Ali Leonard:** around. They don't You don't want

**Christopher Hooper:** dead.

**Luke Neverisky:** It's so sad they

**Ellis Taylor:** out. I mean, how long

**Ali Leonard:** a ocean

**Luke Neverisky:** die.

**Ellis Taylor:** did How long did it take us to get here?

**Ali Leonard:** funeral? They already And they've already been buried in the ocean. I'll turn it around if you want me to. It's just going to take approximately 20

**Tyram:** Damn, that is a bad cornering

**Ali Leonard:** minutes. The boat has been made

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I do have Reviva 5, but I think it's been

**Ali Leonard:** very

**Tyram:** speed.

**Luke Neverisky:** I think

**Ellis Taylor:** too

**Ali Leonard:** large.

**Tyram:** Well, it's

**Ellis Taylor:** long.

**Ali Leonard:** So, out of all of those people in the boat, nobody's

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't think so. But,

**Ellis Taylor:** I do have spare the dying,

**Christopher Hooper:** you know,

**Luke Neverisky:** I think you're dead.

**Ellis Taylor:** but I think they're dead. Dead. It's

**Ali Leonard:** alive. I'm slowly making a

**Tyram:** I don't know. Can you like mage hand to pull

**Ellis Taylor:** okay. At worst, we're just going to we're going to bring their bodies

**Ali Leonard:** turn.

**Tyram:** them into the See if pull them closer. See if they're alive or

**Luke Neverisky:** Dead.

**Ellis Taylor:** back.

**Tyram:** not.

**Ellis Taylor:** Do any of us have mage hand? Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** you do. Yeah, I'm not going to

**Christopher Hooper:** Revivify does cost uh 300 gold pieces, so keep

**Ellis Taylor:** reify

**Ali Leonard:** do. Yeah, we need that pivot up

**Christopher Hooper:** that in mind.

**Ellis Taylor:** them. I can stabilize

**Ali Leonard:** front. So, do I stop turning or what

**Ellis Taylor:** them. I can stabilize them with spare the dying, but I'm sure Tover just wants them

**Ali Leonard:** are we doing?

**Ellis Taylor:** to be dead. It's okay. I want to get

**Christopher Hooper:** You can get

**Ellis Taylor:** them. I don't want to just leave them. Leave their

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. And

**Christopher Hooper:** him.

**Ali Leonard:** then I make I

**Tyram:** Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** bodies.

**Ali Leonard:** do call everyone up to the wheelhouse because I can't really leave the wheelhouse. Do I have an intercom that's not attached to the other intercom? Like

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Not the

**Ali Leonard:** an internal intercom?

**Ellis Taylor:** radio.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, there's the radio and then an intercom and then over the like internal intercom I want to be like everybody up to the wheelhouse please

**Tyram:** I'm going to add up to the wheelhouse.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** over and I want to see if anybody

**Christopher Hooper:** Um um so

**Ali Leonard:** comes

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Olivia heads out there. Uh, everyone else heading to the wheelhouse. Um,

**Tyram:** You know, I'm really

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Tyram:** disappointed in these alleged dragon

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** Hey, they're trying their

**Ali Leonard:** The

**Tyram:** hunters.

**Ali Leonard:** engines weren't on. I will say that. I mean, you could have at least had it running, you know, kind of

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** best.

**Ali Leonard:** like I do have a question. So, I did turn the radio off because they were getting really annoying, but the people that we came with, the dragon knights are on the radio because there's other boats that are being attacked by dragons. And then headquarters is on there as well. They don't really care about that because they were like, "We'll support you." But then they were like, "What's the status of the orb?" And they said it like 15 times and I didn't feel

**Tyram:** I'll think of you

**Ali Leonard:** comfortable saying anything. You know what

**Tyram:** guys. I'll think of you guys there. So,

**Ali Leonard:** I mean? If we're at

**Tyram:** their agenda, I feel like we don't support their agenda with the

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Ali Leonard:** the wheelhouse, I

**Tyram:** orb. Maybe we just tell them we lost

**Ali Leonard:** figured that's what I was

**Tyram:** it. or

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Ali Leonard:** thinking. I was like, "But I can't do that.

**Tyram:** that it got destroyed during the ritual or some s***. I

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, like it got destroyed or like a dragon took it or like something, but like

**Tyram:** don't.

**Ali Leonard:** I can't say that cuz they'll see through me. You know what I

**Tyram:** Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay. Um Oh, we could How about let's just go with a simple explanation. Um, it fell out

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Tyram:** and went into the ocean during the dragon

**Luke Neverisky:** That's

**Tyram:** fight. Now, do you do now do

**Luke Neverisky:** easy.

**Ali Leonard:** mean? Okay. Do you wanna

**Tyram:** you want me to lie for

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** Do you want to tell That would be great. You can call yourself

**Tyram:** you? Oh, I definitely am.

**Ali Leonard:** captain if you want because I did not tell them who I was. I just put on an accent. And you have to say over at the end of it or they get very

**Tyram:** Yeah. Is is the actual captain still around? like Captain Buckle, I think

**Ali Leonard:** angry. And I called our boat

**Tyram:** his name

**Ali Leonard:** big. Is he just like asleep in the captain's

**Tyram:** was. Someone else I'm pretty disappointed with here. Not having the

**Ellis Taylor:** He's

**Tyram:** engines ready to

**Ellis Taylor:** napping.

**Ali Leonard:** chair?

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, wait. What's your what's your deception

**Tyram:** go. Uh, plus uh 11

**Luke Neverisky:** score? I don't

**Ali Leonard:** Also, I called the boat baked stakes, just so everyone knows. Or

**Luke Neverisky:** want to I don't want to steal your moment, but I do have a plus 13 of

**Ali Leonard:** sinks. Bake

**Justin Hale:** Thanks.

**Tyram:** Liliana, you're good at lying to

**Luke Neverisky:** this option. Sometimes a white lie, you just got to do it.

**Tyram:** people. Well, okay, fine.

**Ali Leonard:** sinks. And she could sound like my voice. It's

**Tyram:** Yeah. Hey, if you want to do it. I mean, I feel like lying is kind of my thing, but Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** very

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** I feel like you guys have been pulling the weight. I mean,

**Tyram:** It's also true, and I don't know

**Luke Neverisky:** I'm just got here. I got to, you

**Tyram:** um how to explain this in character, but um I also can't do worse than a 21.

**Luke Neverisky:** know, Oh, you have a really good floor on your lying

**Ali Leonard:** distinctive.

**Luke Neverisky:** skills. Well, then by all

**Justin Hale:** Do you on the black

**Tyram:** Yeah. Like, I've gotten so good at lying that my worst lies, if I had to put a number on them, would be a 21.

**Luke Neverisky:** means, it would be like a

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** 21. That's true. I like your

**Justin Hale:** jack?

**Luke Neverisky:** odds. All right, by all means, go

**Ali Leonard:** Hey.

**Christopher Hooper:** can set out about who's going to bring the coles slaw and the rest

**Tyram:** over

**Christopher Hooper:** of the um so as I was saying before um this is all based on the book Moby Dick and

**Tyram:** I turn the radio back off real

I um you know this radio speak it's hard to um get much of a unique um character but the little intricacies that are necessary you ace him and uh they totally bought that story that you lost it in the water. Um, okay. Um, all right. Big sinks. Uh, what is your estimated time of arrival at the harbor

**Tyram:** I might look over at

**Luke Neverisky:** Wait.

**Christopher Hooper:** in Greyport

**Ali Leonard:** I do calculations. I don't know. Do I know Do I know? I'm not a vote

**Tyram:** Elizabeth.

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, we know distance and we know speed,

**Justin Hale:** Sounds

**Christopher Hooper:** you relay the status of the dragon uh over? Yes. Uh HQ. Um we believe that the Dragon is looking pretty bloodied. Um it looks like they uh are making sure to sink our vessel and kill all aboard, but they uh do

**Justin Hale:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** appear to be fleeing now um for safe harbor over. Hello Jenkins. This is Leroy. Um are you in need of aid? I'm sorry Leroy. Uh this is Jenkins. Um, I would not advise you ADAS at this time. Um, we believe that the beautiful copper dragon is leaving the scene at this point. Over. I'm sorry to hear that, Jenkins. Do you need our aid in any recovery of personnel that are found at sea? Over. Oh, that's a mighty kind offer, Leroy. This is Jenkins. Um, I'm the last alive on this ship. Um, I am not the captain and um, I have mortal wounds, so I will soon be bleeding out over. Well, that's a shame, Jenkins. We do not have a healer on deck at this point. Um, they were killed in the action, so we will not be able to revive you or heal you at this time, but we will remember you and celebrate you at the victory picnic. Over. Thank you,

**Tyram:** And I I put my hand over the receiver like, can we can we get there in time?

**Tyram:** uh made the boat smaller? Would that make us move faster again?

**Luke Neverisky:** page.

**Christopher Hooper:** boat. The engine scale with the boat. The

**Tyram:** What? Yeah, but what if we made the boat smaller and

**Christopher Hooper:** engine scale with the boat.

**Tyram:** then cast in large on the

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that would be

**Tyram:** engines? Brew is

**Christopher Hooper:** smart. But I don't think the brew is that

**Tyram:** incredibly

**Christopher Hooper:** smart. Oh, yeah. Statistically,

**Tyram:** smart.

**Luke Neverisky:** You

**Justin Hale:** smarter than anybody at my height.

**Luke Neverisky:** sure are. You sure are.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah. Hello, Leroy. This is Jenkins. Um, I would just like to see if you

**Tyram:** Let's just

**Christopher Hooper:** forever.

**Luke Neverisky:** Technic.

**Christopher Hooper:** And this goes on

**Tyram:** go. I turn off the radio. This is very

**Christopher Hooper:** for a little bit longer.

**Luke Neverisky:** Let's see how long

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and you start and you start heading back to

**Tyram:** unproductive. Man, these guys are

**Christopher Hooper:** Grayport.

**Tyram:** really, really bad at fighting dragons. Like

**Christopher Hooper:** Um. Oh,

**Tyram:** this was a catastrophe. Like what what are these guys even

**Luke Neverisky:** it

**Tyram:** doing, you

**Christopher Hooper:** what? Um, I guess at this at this point, um, you have everyone aboard. Uh, the Dragon Knights are resting at this point. Um, unconscious but

**Tyram:** know? Good work

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** alive and stabilized.

**Tyram:** team.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and uh it's pretty quiet the rest of the the

**Tyram:** So overall, was it just the one boat that got like totaled or what? Okay. Well, hey, I mean,

**Christopher Hooper:** ride. Seems so.

**Tyram:** it's a quasi successful mission, I guess, then after all. Although, our boat would have been f***** without us.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** This is

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, these guys are like

**Christopher Hooper:** Um you eventually see that it looks like the

**Justin Hale:** true.

**Christopher Hooper:** crew of the boat um was hiding in the quarters.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** boat.


### [03:00:00]

**Justin Hale:** No, that would make things because it doesn't I would imagine it doesn't

**Christopher Hooper:** so yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I didn't really want to think

**Justin Hale:** go to the props and all of the you know transmission

**Christopher Hooper:** about that. Um, but one thing that did also get enlarged with the boat is the the hail casts and they have been nervously drinking in their quarters, uh, waiting for the everything to

**Justin Hale:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** calm down. And, um, eventually they start coming out of the quarters and, uh, Captain Buckle comes into the wheelhouse, says, "Hey, uh, and everything okay? The boat seems bigger. Are we on the same boat?

**Justin Hale:** The boat is the It seems the same size as

**Christopher Hooper:** Am I

**Christopher Hooper:** relaxing, and, uh, one of the knights approaches you, Silus, says, "Hey, uh, Olivia said you uh, you knew where the orb

**Tyram:** I'm afraid that it's been

**Christopher Hooper:** lost. Oh

**Tyram:** ocean.

**Christopher Hooper:** s***. Are we Are we going to go back and get

**Tyram:** You guys can, but I feel like we need to uh we've got so many wounded and the boats in rough shape. So, I just feel like it's just not the not the time. We completed the ritual, so we did what we needed to

**Christopher Hooper:** in? Damn it. Well, All right. Can't believe that we did so much, but I don't have anything to bring back. Was

**Tyram:** do.

**Christopher Hooper:** really hoping for this promotion. All right. Well, it is what it is. Now y'all are all safe. Everyone's

**Tyram:** it. Yeah, Jenkins whole

**Christopher Hooper:** old

**Tyram:** boat. It is. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Tyram:** know. I I

**Christopher Hooper:** an a******, so

**Tyram:** I never met him in any meaningful way, so I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** it'll be all right. I may be able to get a promotion because of the loss of captains on that

**Tyram:** know. I'm going to think over to the rest of the

**Luke Neverisky:** There's some tunnel.

**Christopher Hooper:** ship. This could still work out. All

**Tyram:** party. You know, it sounds like this guy's really the a******

**Justin Hale:** Damn.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, maybe we should have sh she thinks back. Yeah, it sounds like we should have saved

**Tyram:** here. Well, we saved who we were like

**Ellis Taylor:** Jenkins and not this a******.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** close enough to save, I feel

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we say too we could

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

### [03:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** and and at um

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** cool.

**Christopher Hooper:** at the the the early morning, you trickle into the harbor and you see a long line of dragon knights with their sick ass dragon bone armor and they're cheering you on at the docks. Yeah.

**Tyram:** I think it's a party that, you know, now I'm convinced that they must have

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Dragon

**Tyram:** like bought that secondhand because like They don't seem like they're good enough at killing dragons to have gotten it

**Luke Neverisky:** Maybe they're

**Christopher Hooper:** killers. They killed two and a half

**Tyram:** themselves. Oh, they killed

**Christopher Hooper:** dragons. What are you talking about? You

**Tyram:** their

**Christopher Hooper:** see You see Leroy uh behind their boat is drawing. Yeah. They're going to they're going to provide the the

**Luke Neverisky:** just being in the

**Christopher Hooper:** roast dragon meat for the picnic. I

**Tyram:** dragons.

**Christopher Hooper:** waste my time on y'all sometimes. Um, dragon behind the boat is a is a dead um white dragon body um floating along and uh there's cheers at the docks and uh pulled up and uh they're all cheering as you exit the boat and uh there's um and that's where we'll leave it for tonight.

**Ellis Taylor:** Well,

**Justin Hale:** Well, find that

**Christopher Hooper:** It's late and I see the fading in your old

**Justin Hale:** way. No, you

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** don't. I don't.

**Christopher Hooper:** eyes. And that's it.

**Tyram:** Well, good work team. All

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, we didn't die. Close. We didn't

**Ellis Taylor:** Yay! We did

**Tyram:** right, so honestly, I would love it if we could talk to Luna, like

**Ellis Taylor:** it.

**Tyram:** maybe get her perspective on

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Oh, yeah. I was gonna say it's

**Tyram:** things.

**Ellis Taylor:** like perfect that it was Ma because it's his

**Luke Neverisky:** die.

**Ellis Taylor:** goddess. They got to throw the

**Tyram:** Yeah. So, now we just need to track

**Ellis Taylor:** thing. Also, you know, he's

**Tyram:** down Victor and then we can use his orb, his stone to

**Ellis Taylor:** athletic and s***. Oh, yeah.

**Tyram:** talk to

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I need to write that. Next

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I love

**Justin Hale:** We go find

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** time. Next time.

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Justin Hale:** Victor. Punch him in the face. Stone. His

**Tyram:** uh

**Justin Hale:** stone. You got me saying orb

**Tyram:** Yeah, my bad.

**Justin Hale:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** I love that. Uh I love that y'all tied Victor into

**Tyram:** Well, I mean, he's in town,

**Ellis Taylor:** And

**Christopher Hooper:** this. I didn't even have to. It's great.

**Ellis Taylor:** then also we need to like go through the I don't know the data and

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** figure out if we could have you whatever the information we got

**Tyram:** so yeah, We need to we

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** from completing the ritual that we diverted from the dragon

**Tyram:** need to slip away and see what information the George people were trying to get and see if it's something we can use.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. Yeah. So, I didn't want to RP that to belabor it. Um, but you're able to get um a set of coordinates

**Ellis Taylor:** people.

**Christopher Hooper:** um off the machine um that you're able to to

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** hijack um through the terminal, you know, with the keyboard and everything um pressing keys and such um on a floppy disc.

**Justin Hale:** Hold

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh yeah. Yeah. Um, and

**Justin Hale:** off.

**Christopher Hooper:** you're able to to get those. Um, and uh, keep in mind also you uh sabotaged the other relays. Uh, so they got um, now here's a question. Did you um, sabotage it in a way that they just got

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** like no signal or incorrect signals?

**Justin Hale:** I think we said incorrect signals,

**Christopher Hooper:** I think

**Justin Hale:** right? We were purposely

**Christopher Hooper:** so. I think so. Um, so uh one thing next time I will try to remember is to show you a map and and the signals uh coordinates that you got and um I'll let

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** you um choose some couple coordinates that you're sending them to. Um,

**Justin Hale:** luring.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, that was cool. I really thought I was going to

**Luke Neverisky:** there.

**Christopher Hooper:** drown two of you. Um, especially Silus, who I didn't realize had a con mod of

**Tyram:** That was my

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** zero. I was like, "Oh,

**Tyram:** finest turn was the one where I got to stab him and escape all at

**Christopher Hooper:** wow." Yeah. Yeah. I was I was like, "Do you want to hang on?" I don't know. I mean, I could see utility in both. Oh, s***. You would

**Justin Hale:** Then heat.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. I

**Christopher Hooper:** drown

**Tyram:** once.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Now that I can like teleport every turn, like I've got

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** immediately.

**Tyram:** like top tier mobility, so you know, should should be able to get myself out

**Christopher Hooper:** I I feel like to also that like um that rogue feat of of uh if you succeed your

**Tyram:** of.

**Christopher Hooper:** dexterity saving throw, you take no damage is

**Tyram:** Yeah, it's great for

**Christopher Hooper:** like crazy on those AOE spells.

**Tyram:** dragons. Although some of the dragons make you do con saves, which I would be

**Christopher Hooper:** Is

**Tyram:** totally f*****, but or actually

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yeah, I'll have to look

**Tyram:** no, those don't exist. You shouldn't look for

**Christopher Hooper:** those up. Um cuz

**Tyram:** them. Oh yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** like most AoE's are are deck saves for the most

**Tyram:** like most things that just do damage are most often going to be deck

**Christopher Hooper:** part. Yeah. Um, so considering your decks is already very high and like the nice thing about those as a DM is usually they do damage even if you succeed and the fact that even it gets rid of that is

**Tyram:** saves. Monks have it too. So it also applies

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. Let's

**Christopher Hooper:** really really

**Tyram:** to

**Luke Neverisky:** go.

**Christopher Hooper:** powerful. Yeah. Oh my god. So you have that and then your party has so much healing across

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. We we we

**Christopher Hooper:** everybody. Um, yeah, you all have a little bit of healing,

**Ellis Taylor:** corrected.

**Christopher Hooper:** which is really all you need to just get everyone back up. It's

**Tyram:** I need to probably stock up on healing potions because I have

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** absolutely nothing for healing people otherwise. And I think I'm the only one in the

**Ali Leonard:** And you're always like up on top of a ceiling so it can't even get to

**Christopher Hooper:** crazy. That's

**Tyram:** party.

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** true. You were very isolated, but like you were untouched the whole time, so it didn't even matter.

**Tyram:** By sheer coincidence, I was able to not be in a straight line with the other party members at any

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like Luke is experiencing my pain as a bard, which is

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** like low

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, that's that's

**Ellis Taylor:** done.

**Luke Neverisky:** one shot. Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** HP. Yeah. And like

**Tyram:** point. Well, Bards have a rough time when the

**Luke Neverisky:** but it's all good. As you do it,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** enemy has legendary resistance because bards do have a lot of I instantly win uh spells in their repertoire, but

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** the dragon can just eat them to a certain extent, you

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I realized that was gonna it was an uphill battle. So, I was like, "All right, I'm just

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** know. Yeah, probably more an instant win.

**Luke Neverisky:** going to play Healbot

**Tyram:** Um things like Tasha's like autos Irresistible dance like that, like those are all pretty much instant wins.

**Luke Neverisky:** instead.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** But yeah. Oh, uh, what's it? Um, the third level spell that does like a big illusion. Um, no, it

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Tyram:** like the I can't remember the name of it, but like it basically like shuts everyone down for like it's like the non-lethal fireball basically.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mirage.

**Tyram:** Um, that's it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah, that's also basically an instant

**Luke Neverisky:** pattern. Mhm. That's a

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, right. That's an illusion spell, I

**Luke Neverisky:** favorite.

**Christopher Hooper:** guess. Yeah, that one's given like so

**Tyram:** win. Well, it's an instant

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** early, too. It's

**Tyram:** win as long as it's okay for you to run away. If you have to actually kill it, it

**Luke Neverisky:** Yep.

**Tyram:** gives you a free shot, but it doesn't do much more than

**Ellis Taylor:** basketball.

**Christopher Hooper:** crazy.

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Um, I thought it was I thought it was great. Uh, I was happy that you like were still critical, Luke, in like getting Brew back up and getting the engines going. Um, too, uh, cuz it can be sad when you're like Polymorph just

**Luke Neverisky:** Great. Yeah, I know. Well, that's my turn. Yeah, I'm so thankful

**Christopher Hooper:** like padded away.

**Luke Neverisky:** I can heal as a bonus action.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. when you can like heal and buff, it's it's nice to to do those out. Oh man. And it's funny else remembering like, oh yeah, this is a modern

**Ali Leonard:** I forgot. I

**Christopher Hooper:** boat, so like you just start the engine at the

**Ali Leonard:** literally just

**Christopher Hooper:** front. Oh man. Well, I hope y'all had fun. Um, big

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. It's good

**Christopher Hooper:** battle.

**Justin Hale:** Good

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** forgot.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, there's definitely a moment where I was like, are they going to are

**Tyram:** When Brew and


### [03:20:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** they going to all die?

**Tyram:** Liliana both were down, it was looking pretty dicey.

**Luke Neverisky:** stuff.

**Christopher Hooper:** You're not going to kill them

**Justin Hale:** stuff.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** all. And then y'all were like back up

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Nothing

**Christopher Hooper:** like a around later and it was fine

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** happens down

**Christopher Hooper:** like

**Justin Hale:** Well, and then I was down. And then I was up.

**Christopher Hooper:** with Yeah. Yeah. You were It took you a little bit longer but like people were in the right places. The fact that um that

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, that's a cool

**Christopher Hooper:** hill spell from Olivia like just 30 feet

**Luke Neverisky:** again.

**Christopher Hooper:** doesn't need to see doesn't need to touch just like in the

**Tyram:** Man,

**Ellis Taylor:** one.

**Christopher Hooper:** zone. It's like, "Yeah, okay. No problem.

**Justin Hale:** Honestly, that was kind of clutch because if I were to have been hit again while I

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, yeah,

**Justin Hale:** was down, would I have been dead?

**Tyram:** Well, I think

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** you would have gotten like two instant death save,

**Justin Hale:** Cool.

**Tyram:** right? Is that how that

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah." Mhm. Unless

**Justin Hale:** Oh, right. I had a success with

**Tyram:** works?

**Christopher Hooper:** it doubled your your health. Yeah. Which it could

**Justin Hale:** the I

**Christopher Hooper:** have. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** could have. Yeah, I'm only at

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um, so that was I mean it was interesting because Silus was full and like the one mostly engaging and like uh the knights hadn't

**Justin Hale:** 75.

**Christopher Hooper:** yet engaged until just then really. Um, and they were like missing a

**Tyram:** All

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** lot. Um, yeah, that was fun. Cool. Well, have a great week

**Luke Neverisky:** Agree. Yeah, you

**Ellis Taylor:** you,

**Christopher Hooper:** everybody. Um, anybody anybody uh missing

**Luke Neverisky:** too.

**Ellis Taylor:** too.

**Christopher Hooper:** next week that you already know

**Ellis Taylor:** Maybe we might be going climbing, but if it's raining, then we

**Justin Hale:** I don't think

**Ellis Taylor:** won't. And we dry down on Friday night, so

**Tyram:** right. I hope it rains.

**Ellis Taylor:** maybe.

**Christopher Hooper:** of? Okay. I hope it rains, I

**Justin Hale:** so.

**Christopher Hooper:** guess. Um, next time we will uh we will see uh how the picnic goes. Um, if you connect with Victor, um, what's going on with St. George and how they're going to see what happens next with the orb and stuff and where they go

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** and go from there.

**Justin Hale:** So, next session, punch Victor in the face. Got

**Tyram:** He said he was at the

**Christopher Hooper:** Y'all got to find Victor. Do y'all even know where he

**Justin Hale:** it. If

**Tyram:** zoo.

**Christopher Hooper:** is? Yeah, he's at the

**Justin Hale:** he's left the zoo, he's in mortal peril. A

**Tyram:** Well, I mean, we

**Justin Hale:** stress very clearly on the

**Tyram:** have the world's greatest detectives and

**Justin Hale:** phone.

**Tyram:** Olivia, so we'll definitely be able to track him

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. It's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** zoo.

**Luke Neverisky:** true.

**Ellis Taylor:** we got this.

**Christopher Hooper:** E. Yeah, no problem. Probably. probably no problem. I mean, it will be interesting because now because now
