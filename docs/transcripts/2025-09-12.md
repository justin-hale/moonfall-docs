**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, not bad. Um, couple couple things. Um, one is I uh I'm taking all of next week off to

**Christopher Hooper:** recon.

**Luke Neverisky:** uh to cosplay as a full-time game developer. Um, yeah. I was

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh. Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** talking with my brother and I was like, man, I really wish I could just like quit my

**Christopher Hooper:** really?

**Luke Neverisky:** job and, you know, like lean into this hard and see what happens, but obviously I'm not going to quit my job.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, but he's like, "What if you just take like two weeks off and give it a shot?" And I'm like, "I I can't take two weeks, but

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** maybe I can do one week." And um anyway, long story short, I don't abuse my unlimited PTO enough. Uh so here's me abusing it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. All right. Nice. Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Um so I'm going to

**Christopher Hooper:** That's

**Luke Neverisky:** try to like, you know, structure it like have a stand up with myself in the morning, maybe talk to my pets or something and stand up and

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Luke Neverisky:** um you know, have a plan and a scope for what I want try to accomplish. And um honestly just see if like I can just see what it's like, right? And it could be that I get to like Wednesday and be like, "No f****** way." Um and

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** then you know, I'll know, right? Then great. But yeah. Um so yeah, there's there's some excitement about that. one, I get a work week off and two, I guess a, you know, go do my hobby for eight hours a day, five days a week. Um, so we'll

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. And then at the end of the the week, you'll be like, "Yeah, I want to do

**Luke Neverisky:** see. Yeah. Right. Exactly.

**Christopher Hooper:** this for my

**Luke Neverisky:** And I will have done it within the safety of

**Christopher Hooper:** career. Yeah, that's cool. Um, that's a that's

**Luke Neverisky:** PT. Thanks. Yeah, it's

**Christopher Hooper:** a that's a fun

**Luke Neverisky:** uh you know there's no there's no good time to take a week off uh work. So, it's just you just kind of got to say f*** it and

**Christopher Hooper:** idea.

**Luke Neverisky:** commit to a week and

**Christopher Hooper:** Just going to do it. Are you telling your co-workers what you're

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** doing?

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah. And uh it's all good. Like I told I told Zach I told some of my counterparts like, "Hey, I'm just going to come to get my desk." So like try not to bother me but if something blows up like I am literally a chrome

**Christopher Hooper:** Gotcha.

**Luke Neverisky:** stab um yeah and then uh I am this week we use them as a so we're consultants and so we bill time

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** accordingly and um and I was in a meeting with the other members of ELT and we used a thing called Deltech. I was like, you know, Deltech f****** sucks. I'm going to replace it. Like, okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Come

**Luke Neverisky:** So, uh, this week I drafted up a plan, gathered a team together, and drew a six-month road map for design,

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice.

**Luke Neverisky:** implementation, um, and, uh, top. So, it's a scary undertaking,

**Tyram:** on. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** but should be fruitful or hopefully fruitful. But

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. Nice. Have you um have you like hooked up your video game project with like get and uh like any

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah, you know, I tried and

**Christopher Hooper:** remote deployments at

**Luke Neverisky:** admittedly I am um I need someone to hold my hands through it is basically what I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** all? Okay.

**Tyram:** That's so

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, I tried I tried to do it and then like accidentally wiped

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Gotcha.

**Tyram:** cool.

**Luke Neverisky:** a couple of classes. Um, and I had

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Luke Neverisky:** a very very tense like three hours like how the f*** do I

**Christopher Hooper:** Uhhuh.

**Luke Neverisky:** get to recover the s***? And I'm like, okay, I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** I I found like it way way harder than like any other any other coding project I've ever

**Luke Neverisky:** um

**Christopher Hooper:** done because there's just like so so many just like just like tons of assets and files and they all are important and

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** also like I think you're not even supposed to like you're only supposed to commit like a subset of the like Unreal code to uh to your project. Um because technically like you

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** don't own it. Um so I think I accidentally like committed like my Unreal 4 project or whatever. Um they haven't come after me yet,

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh yeah, they got bigger fish. Um

**Christopher Hooper:** but like I don't know if I'm supposed to do

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah, interesting. I um I also

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Luke Neverisky:** know so when I was trying to do it like you have there's like there's some intermediary. There's like git and then there's GitHub and then there's something like that am I saying the right words. Okay, I'm saying

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, you're saying

**Luke Neverisky:** things. Okay. I love when I say things.

**Christopher Hooper:** things. Well, Git's probably the intermediary

**Luke Neverisky:** Um yes, yeah, yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** if if that's what you're talking about.

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah. And I'm out of my element at

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So like git

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** is like the source control um software and github is like the actual like hosting of it. Um technically there are other like source control uh frameworks like Mercury and other things but basically like 99.9% of all projects are going to be using

**Justin Hale:** Luke, do you not use

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh for Unreal, no. I uh I play with

**Justin Hale:** Git? Don't you use it for like do you not use it in your day-to-day

**Christopher Hooper:** Git.

**Tyram:** I was taught from a young age not to do that,

**Luke Neverisky:** fire for my day job.

**Tyram:** not to play with

**Luke Neverisky:** Um not anymore. I uh for this

**Tyram:** fire.

**Justin Hale:** job?

**Luke Neverisky:** first public I uh have not actually done hands-on development for work in I'm one of those that uh I no longer do develop my day job. I tell people how to develop but I don't actually do

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, I I order background all

**Justin Hale:** gotcha. That's um very different from what Asurian does because even at the senior manager level, you're still expected to commit code.

**Luke Neverisky:** day. Oh, really? I mean, that's I would I would not be a senior

**Justin Hale:** That's um that's

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Justin Hale:** what three levels up for

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** me. Um gosh, I don't even

**Luke Neverisky:** manager.

**Justin Hale:** know. I know some directors that still commit code. Actually, engineering's

**Luke Neverisky:** Well, damn. Then I definitely


### [00:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** That's

**Justin Hale:** engineering is not a um career goal at

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** terrifying.

**Justin Hale:** Asian. I'll I'll say that.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. No kidding. I

**Christopher Hooper:** We used to have the the worst

**Luke Neverisky:** can't

**Christopher Hooper:** position which was uh a what was it a tech lead manager and they were basically expected to do full-time

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** management and full-time engineering. Uh

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** so they did neither well

**Justin Hale:** that's what Techlan's already assuring.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. actually.

**Christopher Hooper:** or they if they yeah if they're smart they're really just doing the management side and being like well I might have not committed anything but my reports did and they did a good job so we

**Luke Neverisky:** That's actually yeah when I was prior to the position I'm in I was exactly that. Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** win.

**Luke Neverisky:** it's the description no joke from my manager at the time was you are a senior manager with line respons like not line management responsibilities but perfect

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** f******.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. And like our organization doesn't really do like program managers or like project managers very well at all. So we

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, you're

**Christopher Hooper:** basically are all doing that

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah. Love to see

**Christopher Hooper:** ourselves. So we actually need our managers to like fill those

**Luke Neverisky:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** gaps a lot of the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. So, yeah. So, like who leads it like see uh scrum ceremonies? things like that be or is it just like the team gets together and kind of figures it

**Christopher Hooper:** times. Yeah. Usually, usually there's like a team

**Luke Neverisky:** out. Gota

**Christopher Hooper:** lead or something. They kind of like will lead scrum or something like

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. We we are tasked

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** with handling scrum ourselves. We don't have uh project managers or any of

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** that. though honestly like

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** I prefer it that way because

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh otherwise we like get sidetracked by like um by a person who's like so devoted to like getting their chart working that it changes every week and they're like you're missing one of the values for this chart that I made yesterday. And I'm like, I I don't know anything about the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. That is a good point. I remember they're not technical and like so that and they're not supposed to be technical but at the same time I had a PM when I was a developer that was like I had to like we had to stop stand up and explain to them like what we were doing and

**Christopher Hooper:** stable. Right.

**Luke Neverisky:** and like this is supposed to be like 10 minutes like

**Christopher Hooper:** Right. Right. Yeah. The problem with our

**Luke Neverisky:** time

**Christopher Hooper:** standups is everything that everyone's working on, everyone wants to do a

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** deep dive in and they're like, "Wait, why are you running into that

**Luke Neverisky:** no.

**Christopher Hooper:** problem?" Uh, let's see. We could probably figure it out right now. And like, that's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** not the point of this. That's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. You just want to help. I

**Christopher Hooper:** uh but anyway, I can set up Git for

**Luke Neverisky:** agree. All right. Cool. I do. Thank

**Christopher Hooper:** you, Luke, if you need help with that.

**Luke Neverisky:** you. Uh I

**Christopher Hooper:** That's like the only thing I set up for my video game project is like a git deployment and then I was like ah that that's just that's fine. I'm going to call it

**Luke Neverisky:** have so I mean between me and you, we could have a

**Christopher Hooper:** a day

**Luke Neverisky:** full product going what you're

**Christopher Hooper:** now. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. It's the visual stuff that I'm like, ah, I can't be

**Luke Neverisky:** saying. See? Yeah. Yeah, you just got to commit to low poly, 2D, whatever. Lean into the

**Christopher Hooper:** asked. Yeah. And it's not Python, so I can't just be like

**Justin Hale:** You can

**Luke Neverisky:** cartoony uh I

**Christopher Hooper:** import

**Justin Hale:** pull public assets or paper

**Luke Neverisky:** mean you can

**Christopher Hooper:** world.

**Luke Neverisky:** and uh I mean animating in Blender is Python for what it's worth.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah, that's true. But

**Justin Hale:** assets.

**Christopher Hooper:** like it's not it's not very I didn't find it very intuitive

**Justin Hale:** Don't wait for

**Christopher Hooper:** to be able to like do something in Blender and have it like automatically get applied in my

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh, dude. It's There's no

**Christopher Hooper:** project. Like there's a whole

**Luke Neverisky:** good pipeline for that. It sucks. There should

**Christopher Hooper:** like you're right. Yeah. You got to be like generate artifact, move artifact to

**Luke Neverisky:** be.

**Christopher Hooper:** project, apply in blueprint

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Yeah, it's

**Christopher Hooper:** your your your

**Luke Neverisky:** I it we're over here in 2025. We still have to like go through six weeks to get something in Unreal. Anyway, I could pitch about for hours,

**Christopher Hooper:** artifact, you

**Luke Neverisky:** but

**Christopher Hooper:** know, and I'm like, "Hey, Claude Code, do this for me." And they're

**Luke Neverisky:** yeah. Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** like, "Got nothing for you here." That's a great idea. I f***** it. All right. I don't see who's here. Who's all here so

**Luke Neverisky:** s***. Everyone was

**Tyram:** Everyone's here. We can stop talking nerd

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. Absolutely.

**Walden Briarhelm:** in. It is a scientific fact. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** believe I can

**Tyram:** organize for everybody like you know as a as an apology wore like Dragon Ball and like Zelda shirts you know

**Justin Hale:** I don't believe you. I

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, f***

**Christopher Hooper:** the past month just for

**Justin Hale:** hand. It's just a

**Luke Neverisky:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Yeah, it looks

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. You're like, "This is this is it, right? He's green. He's some green

**Christopher Hooper:** enough.

**Justin Hale:** idiot,

**Christopher Hooper:** He's got a sword. Kind of a little little

**Tyram:** Well, since Breath of the Wild, like I feel like the easier route to cosplay Link now is just get the blue shirt, you know? You don't necessarily need like the hat and

**Justin Hale:** bro.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** everything and like the the the skirt and everything

**Luke Neverisky:** good point.

**Tyram:** it might have been the first one where you could ride a horse actually.

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** was that was the the big thing,

**Tyram:** Yeah, I know you couldn't in the first and second game

**Justin Hale:** Is that

**Tyram:** and I don't think uh Link to the Past had a horse. So I

**Justin Hale:** a Was that a total

**Luke Neverisky:** so. You had

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Tyram:** I think that's actually right.

**Luke Neverisky:** a

**Christopher Hooper:** No, I know about this game a lot. I gave it

**Justin Hale:** guess? You

**Christopher Hooper:** a shot. It sucks. It's a bad

**Justin Hale:** don't. All

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** game and a bad franchise in

**Tyram:** Yeah. Well, you you are

**Walden Briarhelm:** Have you not

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Luke Neverisky:** god.

**Tyram:** comically wrong, but like not even to the point where I'm mad. I honestly I pity you more when you say that because of how

**Justin Hale:** Very

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. Oh, my sweet summer

**Christopher Hooper:** general.

**Tyram:** wrong you are.

**Walden Briarhelm:** listening?

**Luke Neverisky:** child. Yeah.

**Tyram:** That is


### [00:20:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** There goes our podcast ratings.

**Luke Neverisky:** God.

**Justin Hale:** gross. I read

**Luke Neverisky:** What?

**Christopher Hooper:** What? You read it? Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** I read I read

**Ellis Taylor:** just kicks his

**Justin Hale:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the call session. I did not get to

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. I'm just wondering because I feel

**Ellis Taylor:** own. I have to

**Christopher Hooper:** like I used you too as a conduit for a big lore dump. And so I'm hoping that you actually know about the lore

**Walden Briarhelm:** listen.

**Ellis Taylor:** wait.

**Tyram:** We actually learned a lot about uh

**Christopher Hooper:** dump.

**Tyram:** especially Ma's backstory with like uh his goddess and

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, especially like his goddess

**Tyram:** everything.

**Christopher Hooper:** and religious aspects.

**Tyram:** And we learned about

**Ellis Taylor:** This wind

**Tyram:** Brew like having dragons from his homeland in the south. And

**Walden Briarhelm:** What?

**Ellis Taylor:** will unless we fill this ship up with dragons and

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. Whoa.

**Tyram:** uh we interacted with Victor. Some This is your lore,

**Walden Briarhelm:** What?

**Ellis Taylor:** wood.

**Luke Neverisky:** And now he has

**Tyram:** Justin. This is an integral part of your backstory

**Luke Neverisky:** the pet dragon. So it's perfect.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um um an

**Tyram:** apparently. And now he has a pet dragon, which

**Justin Hale:** And it's

**Christopher Hooper:** untamed dragon. Yes, that's

**Tyram:** is Yeah. Like canonically completely tamed. You're you spent most of the last session like flying around on

**Justin Hale:** unmuted. I approve of that.

**Tyram:** its back doing sick aerial tricks and things like

**Justin Hale:** The other stuff was about as accurate as the green Power Ranger being.

**Christopher Hooper:** pretty.

**Justin Hale:** Like all I remember is

**Luke Neverisky:** All

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you know, it's fine. I I would

**Justin Hale:** we have some like some some uh

**Christopher Hooper:** love

**Justin Hale:** anti human dragons going on.

**Christopher Hooper:** h*****. Is that what you said? I don't

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** I don't remember that

**Tyram:** I think he's talking about like the

**Justin Hale:** Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** part,

**Tyram:** sexy dragon person from uh their

**Justin Hale:** Duncan and

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** bro. Right.

**Tyram:** human. He picked the worst way to describe

**Justin Hale:** Betty. I mean, I didn't describe

**Christopher Hooper:** Right.

**Tyram:** it, but I think that's what he's talking

**Ellis Taylor:** How is

**Justin Hale:** it. Claude

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** very hinty. Um people

**Tyram:** about.

**Ellis Taylor:** business? Just what every dragon trapper needs. One hand

**Christopher Hooper:** who were here or anyone uh you want to use your collective knowledge to

**Ellis Taylor:** comes the bleed and monstrous nightmare survival. The other sprays

**Christopher Hooper:** share what

**Ellis Taylor:** hideous simple back. Oh, this is

**Luke Neverisky:** There's some

**Tyram:** I think it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** I've been walking

**Luke Neverisky:** And me,

**Tyram:** Ally. Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** around getting cables and power

**Luke Neverisky:** too. I'll be on a

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm I'm on the

**Tyram:** Whatever.

**Walden Briarhelm:** things. Get everything set

**Justin Hale:** My camera's on. I just walk around a lot. So,

**Luke Neverisky:** sec.

**Walden Briarhelm:** up.

**Justin Hale:** sometimes I'm in frame, sometimes I'm

**Tyram:** Okay. Fair enough.

**Ellis Taylor:** So much for us all being

**Christopher Hooper:** go. Yeah, we're all kind of on

**Tyram:** Well, hey, let's take

**Ellis Taylor:** so on time.

**Christopher Hooper:** time.

**Tyram:** advantage of it. Okay, so uh so last time

**Justin Hale:** not.

**Tyram:** um we started off by kind of planning uh how we were going to

**Ellis Taylor:** No, this is awesome.

**Tyram:** like get to Hell Judge and like retake

**Luke Neverisky:** against the

**Tyram:** The the first city. thing we did was go visit was go to the drop off point with the uh with all the gold that we stole for the dragons tribute and we uh had a discussion with the dragons. Um we revealed to the dragons that Helga Oh, hello young uh Francis. Yeah, we revealed to the dragons that Helga has been playing them for fools for a while. We also uh gave them the the gold and we gave them the

**Luke Neverisky:** Sorry,

**Tyram:** Bugatti, which Brew is totally cool

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that's It's a good thing

**Luke Neverisky:** bro.

**Justin Hale:** I wasn't

**Tyram:** with. I think we actually said that like, uh, oh, Brew hates this, you

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like we played it well.

**Tyram:** know. But yeah, um, yeah. Anyway, um we were able to show them that we have the orb and we also were able to tell them like, hey, like uh we can create an opportunity for you to go down to the ironclaw base and just

**Justin Hale:** there.

**Tyram:** wreck their s*** to get revenge. And so they uh they were after we made some persuasion checks, uh they were amenable to that plan and uh we're set to uh Martha correctly pointed out that we can actually just draw a line on our map with our magic paint to get them like

**Justin Hale:** That's

**Luke Neverisky:** I am built.

**Tyram:** straight f****** to it. So um Um, so yeah, they were amenable to that plan and uh yeah, so we are uh good. We got three days after that is

**Justin Hale:** true.

**Tyram:** when we're supposed to be doing the attack with the dragons. Um, we did we ran into Victor on the mountain who was collecting dragon s*** because he wanted to try to turn it into a bomb or something. I don't know. Victor does weird stuff all the time and I've honestly stopped questioning it.

**Justin Hale:** This is

**Tyram:** Um he revealed that apparently he had intended for us to blow up his own factory and that uh he was

**Justin Hale:** true.

**Tyram:** according to him at least I mean I don't know how trustworthy he is but he said he was doing it to try to uh make sure that Helga couldn't use the violescence to perform a

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes.

**Tyram:** ritual. Um but we took the violescence anyway so I feel like you know that's a wash. Um he said that he was going to go on to Crateport and so uh the seeds had been sewn for us to run into him there. Um we then went to uh to High Forge. We went back to Little Havvel where uh Helisana played her very first concert. We ran into this weedy little detective who uh apparently is looking for missing persons. one of the person he's looking for specifically was that uh yeah, Victor is not trustworthy. It's not blasphemy. But

**Luke Neverisky:** memories.

**Tyram:** um but this detective is looking for uh that very same girl that uh Silus rescued from the uh synthesis plant. The one who was like

**Justin Hale:** Oh

**Tyram:** trapped inside of like the experiment tube with all the other. She was the

**Justin Hale:** yeah.

**Tyram:** lucid one. Um, so yeah, he's looking for her and I was be like, "Oh, hey, we

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** saw her like I think it's been like two days or something like in game time, but yeah, we saw her recently." And so apparently we're uh going to pick up with that at some point apparently was the plan to like take part in this investigation to find uh what's her name? But I I'm sorry. I can't Oh, wait. It was April. It was like

**Luke Neverisky:** That sounds

**Tyram:** April Bonal or something like that, right? I remember it sounded like April O'Neal from the Teenage Mutant Ninja

**Luke Neverisky:** familiar.

**Tyram:** Turtles. But um anyway, um Helisana put on a kick-ass

**Walden Briarhelm:** What's

**Tyram:** concert. Um she managed to uh like kind

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** of envelop more of the impressionable youths of the city.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that?

**Tyram:** And apparently the force that drives her was telling her to start a killing spree, but she didn't. So um instead

**Justin Hale:** Whoa.

**Tyram:** she Yeah. So, apparently there's that's a thing that we're going to have to

**Justin Hale:** Was that in my

**Tyram:** uh try to make sure it doesn't happen, which is that uh I I don't think so, but the malevolent force that uh empowers Helisana apparently wants to have all

**Justin Hale:** notes?

**Tyram:** the all the tweakers. Yeah. But

**Ali Leonard:** It was vaguely in the notes.

**Justin Hale:** Resist mental compulsion to harm her

**Tyram:** apparently it wants to have all the tweakers start a uh basically like a

**Luke Neverisky:** Nah, it's

**Tyram:** like citywide genocide or whatever. Um so, we should

**Justin Hale:** allies. So the opposite of system of a down. Okay,

**Tyram:** probably stop that. And

**Ali Leonard:** Just early things.

**Justin Hale:** cool.

**Tyram:** um but um Helisana managed to keep her cool though and instead is directing all of our uh our headbangers to build us a kick-ass stage in the great hall,

**Luke Neverisky:** fine.

**Tyram:** I think it was, so that we can we can hold that giant concert at the same time the dragons are supposed to be coming and have the dragons and the the ravers converge on uh on Hell. Helisana's fortress. Not Hel at Helga's fortress in the

**Luke Neverisky:** Well done.

**Tyram:** forart. And that's where we left

**Ali Leonard:** As a player who ditched, I do have a

**Tyram:** off. Well, a player was here last week. I don't care. No, I'm just

**Ali Leonard:** question.

**Tyram:** kidding.

**Ali Leonard:** Why? I'll keep it to myself. But also, why did the dragons not want the

**Tyram:** They said they were going to try to take it, but like my count and I was actually worried

**Walden Briarhelm:** Awesome.

**Tyram:** they would kill me for a second, but um counter was

**Ali Leonard:** orb? For sure. You're very

**Tyram:** basically like can you move faster than I can think because I can

**Ali Leonard:** tiny.

**Tyram:** just use this to control you and like you know so why

**Ali Leonard:** Okay, I was

**Tyram:** don't you talk? So,

**Ali Leonard:** just wondering. Just wondering. Thank

**Justin Hale:** There's some

**Tyram:** yeah. So, that that was a real uh that was a real tense

**Justin Hale:** names.

**Tyram:** issue for a second there, but we managed to uh to

**Justin Hale:** So there's

**Christopher Hooper:** The notes will

**Tyram:** talk our way out of that

**Ali Leonard:** you.


### [00:30:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** probably not mention that they had like a nat 20 and like a 27 and like very

**Ali Leonard:** It said 27 and then I was just like

**Christopher Hooper:** high.

**Tyram:** one.

**Ali Leonard:** I assume it had something to do with that conversation but it didn't

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, they had very good persuasion rules with the dragons. So everything worked out

**Ali Leonard:** mention

**Justin Hale:** uh there's the dragon

**Christopher Hooper:** very

**Ali Leonard:** yeah it's actually good I wasn't there

**Justin Hale:** lore.

**Ali Leonard:** because we would have

**Christopher Hooper:** well.

**Ali Leonard:** died been like immediately roll persuasion Mooney, you

**Justin Hale:** So, did we we learned more dragon

**Ali Leonard:** are on crack. Where did you get

**Justin Hale:** names last week? Is that what the dragon lore dump at the end is

**Luke Neverisky:** Oh yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah, one of them was like uh they had like surprisingly normal ass

**Justin Hale:** about? Well,

**Tyram:** names. Oh, we also got like the big

**Justin Hale:** yeah.

**Tyram:** cosmic dragon. We know their name. And we also and apparently there's a

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** good guy dragon who's like uh the lover of Luna, the

**Ali Leonard:** that?

**Tyram:** l the moon goddess who like fell to Earth. Um I his name was cool. It was like Nixaros or something like

**Ellis Taylor:** There. There

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** that. That sounds right. I know it started with an N and

**Ellis Taylor:** we go.

**Tyram:** had an X in there somewhere. Um the evil dragon who's inside the orb, who's a completely different dragon, is like it's like

**Justin Hale:** There's astronom

**Tyram:** 25 letters long and yeah, it's Astro. It's Astro something something

**Luke Neverisky:** That's true.

**Tyram:** something. We're not supposed to say the name out loud. And honestly, I couldn't

**Ali Leonard:** Astronomicon. But that's the

**Tyram:** even if I tried as hard as I could. She who

**Ali Leonard:** one. She who shall not be

**Tyram:** shall not be named. Mrs. Everything from inside the

**Ali Leonard:** named. So the sexy

**Tyram:** orb.

**Ali Leonard:** dragons worship the orb dragon is what I

**Tyram:** Yes. Yeah. The red one was a red dragon, one was a black

**Ali Leonard:** got. But if we

**Tyram:** dragon, and yes, apparently they're on team orb

**Ali Leonard:** take So is

**Tyram:** dragon.

**Ali Leonard:** part of the negotiation that they get the orb in the

**Tyram:** We didn't tell them that. We just told them we were going to help them

**Ali Leonard:** end or no. Okay. Okay. Okay.

**Tyram:** sick. Uh we we just told them we were going to give them an opportunity to go kill

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** I know

**Tyram:** Helja. Yeah. I found the whole

**Ali Leonard:** Revenge. Which is fun for everyone. Okay. Good.

**Tyram:** family. Yeah. Hello, young

**Ali Leonard:** Cuz Yeah, just cuz you know prophecy. I don't have any cats

**Justin Hale:** that's

**Ali Leonard:** around our

**Justin Hale:** life.

**Tyram:** Astrid.

**Ali Leonard:** chicken.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hello. We're going to go to

**Ali Leonard:** Hi

**Justin Hale:** Hey,

**Christopher Hooper:** bed now. Good

**Justin Hale:** Thea. Come

**Christopher Hooper:** night.

**Justin Hale:** here. Look. Oh, where's the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. You sit

**Justin Hale:** P? Say hi.

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Ali Leonard:** I hear K-pop Demon

**Justin Hale:** There we go. Say hi.

**Christopher Hooper:** Hi.

**Ali Leonard:** Hunters. Which child household is listening to K-pop Demon

**Ellis Taylor:** I heard it

**Justin Hale:** Hi. Say good night. Good

**Christopher Hooper:** Good night.

**Tyram:** What about K-pop demon

**Ali Leonard:** Hunters? One of the child's households is listening

**Ellis Taylor:** too. I heard it too,

**Ali Leonard:** to K-pop Demon

**Justin Hale:** night. Good

**Tyram:** hunters?

**Ali Leonard:** Hunters. I assumed it wasn't

**Justin Hale:** night.

**Tyram:** I'm sorry. What was I saying? What?

**Justin Hale:** Oh, you can't see

**Ali Leonard:** Taylor. It's

**Ellis Taylor:** Ally. There it

**Justin Hale:** it. We uh we watched it recently and now we're

**Tyram:** It's really

**Ellis Taylor:** is.

**Justin Hale:** hooked. It is very

**Ali Leonard:** Justin. That's so

**Justin Hale:** good. See absolutely loves the song Golden. She asks for the song

**Ali Leonard:** good.

**Justin Hale:** Golden all the

**Tyram:** good. I'm not a huge K-pop guy, but all the songs are legit like just brainworms, you

**Justin Hale:** time. So, I am a pretty big K-pop fan. And the funny part

**Tyram:** know?

**Justin Hale:** is all of my K-pop playlists that are autogenerated have had all these songs on them and I didn't know that's what they were from. So when I was watching the movie I was like, "Oh god, I know all of these songs

**Tyram:** Yeah, the songs are just like legit good songs apparently. Not like they they've been like on the top of the charts for like last few

**Justin Hale:** already." Yeah, it's good

**Tyram:** weeks it

**Ellis Taylor:** They got robbed at the

**Justin Hale:** stuff. Surprise.

**Tyram:** seems. Bastard.

**Justin Hale:** They're going to make two more of these movies,

**Tyram:** Two

**Justin Hale:** eh? Yeah, that's uh that's what I read

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, why not?

**Ellis Taylor:** BMAS. Yeah, but the main

**Tyram:** more.

**Ellis Taylor:** like showrunner or something is not on the project anymore,

**Justin Hale:** recently. What the hell? Well,

**Ellis Taylor:** so I'm nervous.

**Justin Hale:** anything worth doing is worth overdoing with television. It's got to be

**Ellis Taylor:** I have questions.

**Justin Hale:** um it's got to be lucrative lucrative enough to run to the

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm

**Tyram:** Oh.

**Justin Hale:** ground.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm almost ready, but y'all should discuss what y'all want to do next than what what you're actually Right.

**Justin Hale:** I think we break the fourth wall and make uh medium talk to

**Tyram:** Okay. So,

**Justin Hale:** himself

**Tyram:** um we've got a few days before the dragon attack. So, we got to try to coordinate having the concert like just before the dragons arrive so that like we can get them like pinser movementing on like the

**Justin Hale:** for

**Luke Neverisky:** Yes. The next three

**Tyram:** iron claws, you know, like attacking from two directions at the same time. So, theoretically, we got a couple of days to just

**Luke Neverisky:** days.

**Tyram:** like do s*** and get ready, which I would definitely say we should uh take a long rest when we get

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm. I agree with that.

**Tyram:** a chance.

**Luke Neverisky:** Are we going to go take a long rest at um Isa's apartment still up? Yeah, it's still up,

**Tyram:** Oh, yeah. We That's something we talked about last time was going to go try to

**Luke Neverisky:** right? Yeah, that's

**Tyram:** check out Olivia's apartment.

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I was under the assumption it was like swarmed with iron

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. We can go see

**Ellis Taylor:** claws, but we can if we feel like it's

**Luke Neverisky:** right. We're

**Tyram:** if that's the case at least. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** safe.

**Luke Neverisky:** clear.

**Tyram:** Um, and if that I'm sure we can find a place to sleep if that doesn't pan out. So, um, I guess we could also uh since we have some uh time before we and apparently all of your headbangers are building the stage for us, but I don't know if like uh Brew and Brew and Ellith want

**Ali Leonard:** It's up to

**Tyram:** to like start working on special effects and stuff. It's a real banger of a concert,

**Ali Leonard:** code.

**Luke Neverisky:** True. It's

**Tyram:** you know. Um, but we might also, I guess, have time to try to follow up on April if we wanted to do

**Luke Neverisky:** true. That's true. Do we

**Ali Leonard:** protective.

**Luke Neverisky:** remember is she in the do we have reason to believe she's in the city or like total

**Tyram:** that. Last time we saw her, she was like, it was weeks ago for us, but apparently it was only a couple

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** cold

**Tyram:** of days ago when we were doing the the bombing raid. That's when we last saw her.

**Luke Neverisky:** right all right so I guess that would be probably a good way to kill

**Tyram:** Wasn't there like a a followup we could maybe go after? Like, wasn't it like some sort of like Do you guys remember what it was? Was it like a pizza

**Luke Neverisky:** What's the

**Tyram:** place or something that we were supposed to go look at

**Luke Neverisky:** place? Um

**Tyram:** or There was some

**Ellis Taylor:** I wrote

**Tyram:** sort of establishment that we were supposed to go look at, but I don't remember what

**Ellis Taylor:** next time. Yeah,

**Tyram:** kind.

**Ellis Taylor:** I said wrote I wrote down next time follow up on April

**Justin Hale:** Okay. It's

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** leads. I think one of the guys owned a pizza

**Tyram:** Okay. It was a pizza place,

**Ellis Taylor:** place nearby like really like right next to where we are.

**Tyram:** right? Yeah. I mean, either way, we should

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Tyram:** go to the pizza place because, you know,

**Justin Hale:** Wait,

**Luke Neverisky:** f*** yeah.

**Tyram:** everyone likes pizza except for that sick degenerate.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, I think if we go to a pizza place, I'm going to have

**Justin Hale:** Daddy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to try it. It's been the

**Luke Neverisky:** Peace.

**Ellis Taylor:** He almost gonna have to do a constitution saving

**Walden Briarhelm:** talk. Deal. 100%

**Ellis Taylor:** throw to see if he becomes addicted to pizza or not.

**Justin Hale:** and develops a

**Tyram:** worse things to be

**Luke Neverisky:** This is true. This is

**Tyram:** addicted

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Walden Briarhelm:** deal. I like

**Luke Neverisky:** very

**Tyram:** to. I mean, Helisana's got whatever she's addicted to.

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Justin Hale:** Brooklyn. Depends on the

**Luke Neverisky:** true.

**Tyram:** That seems way worse than pizza.

**Justin Hale:** pizza, I guess.

**Luke Neverisky:** Debatable.

**Justin Hale:** He's addicted to pineapple pizza. Yeah, that's

**Luke Neverisky:** I mean,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Metal. I'm addicted to metal.

**Luke Neverisky:** yes. All right. Uh, so we need to figure out what play is

**Justin Hale:** worse.

**Luke Neverisky:** called. I guess that's logical next step to figure out what's the only lead we got,

**Ali Leonard:** Tuesday, former NXT

**Luke Neverisky:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** Let's see. Are y'all still y'all are still at the little

**Ali Leonard:** champions turn

**Luke Neverisky:** At

**Christopher Hooper:** Hubble, right? Is that where we ended? I think

**Tyram:** I I think

**Justin Hale:** You got to do

**Christopher Hooper:** so. Um, so, uh,

**Ali Leonard:** WWE. Don't miss

**Christopher Hooper:** recently hired detective,

**Tyram:** so.

**Ali Leonard:** him.

**Christopher Hooper:** um, Chalk Rock is, I think, still prowling around, um,

**Justin Hale:** this.

**Luke Neverisky:** least I got

**Christopher Hooper:** with Kit Kat and

**Luke Neverisky:** Snickers. That's all right.

**Christopher Hooper:** Snickers.

**Tyram:** Oh, yeah. They were April's friends. Oh, and it was established last time that like there was a maybe a chance that they could have like fallen in love with each other at some point in their past, but that they they never seized the moment. And so like that's there's this

**Luke Neverisky:** Silus, time to work your magic again.

**Tyram:** unspoken thing between them.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh,

**Tyram:** I think

**Walden Briarhelm:** silence. Yeah,

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah, let's

**Tyram:** they're both married now if I remember correctly. There we

**Walden Briarhelm:** matchmaker. Yeah, never

**Luke Neverisky:** make sure

**Walden Briarhelm:** mind.

**Justin Hale:** All's fair and love and war.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh Toeer, if you're there, could you uh set the scene? Like a lot of stuff is building up when there's a very very quick turnaround of three days where we have to be ready for basically war. Is that how you guys

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** go. Big ass battle at least.

**Walden Briarhelm:** would describe this? Let's

**Christopher Hooper:** Let me let me uh lay down some of the key facts that you're missing. Um

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** so, uh importantly, the pizza place is called Ratty's

**Luke Neverisky:** Thank you. Thank you.


### [00:40:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** Piland, owned by Bernardo. And Bernardo is a toral. And uh we learned that torals uh worship the moon goddess that got blown out of the sky and the and she loved this dragon god. And how does that fit in the broader

**Walden Briarhelm:** go. Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** context? You don't know. It doesn't make any sense. The timeline doesn't make any

**Luke Neverisky:** Sh.

**Christopher Hooper:** sense because they were lovers before she got blown up. And did the dragons arrive before or after? It doesn't make any sense. Brew knows they arrived before um the

**Justin Hale:** I know a lot of things that don't make sense.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh you have ravers and they're building you a stage, but will they continue to listen? Cuz all you told them was build a stage and are they going to come back or are they going to go do drugs in the lake again or

**Luke Neverisky:** I hope

**Christopher Hooper:** listen to pop music? What's going to happen? The dragons are going to arrive in 3 days. probably closer to two and a half by now. And are they going to listen to you?

**Tyram:** This

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, you did give them

**Tyram:** is such a whiny

**Luke Neverisky:** not.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, uh, if you want if you want the non whiny, you do it

**Justin Hale:** Damn. Got

**Christopher Hooper:** yourself.

**Tyram:** recap. I said everything that

**Justin Hale:** him.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you didn't mention Ratty's Pand.

**Tyram:** mattered.

**Justin Hale:** Ran by Maro.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and so,

**Tyram:** I kind of remember the name of the place. I just remembered a pizza

**Christopher Hooper:** um, it's Ratty's Pand and the dragons are going to wait for you. Uh, and if you don't give them a magical hole straight

**Tyram:** place.

**Christopher Hooper:** to where they need to go, then they're going to destroy the whole

**Justin Hale:** Is that what they sound

**Christopher Hooper:** city. And uh, kind of um, and

**Justin Hale:** like?

**Christopher Hooper:** Victor wanted dragon poop for his explosives. And, uh, now he's off to Great, which you

**Tyram:** I did say

**Christopher Hooper:** mentioned. And let's see what else. Oh. Um, let's see. I think that's it. Oh, yeah. Uh, you also learned that, um, April Bonal

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** was hanging out with, um, Casey

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** Amen.

**Christopher Hooper:** Bones. Um, and Bernardo at the, uh, Ratty's Piland. Um, one thing that you would probably So, you've been going around the city, you know, fairly willy-nilly. And a part of this is because you've got those disguises. And so, even though there are like ironclaw patrols, like y'all have kind of gamed out like

**Justin Hale:** Daddy.

**Christopher Hooper:** staying subtle, like going around the city in your disguises, so it's like

**Luke Neverisky:** Sound

**Christopher Hooper:** not a big deal. Um, so if you want to check out Olivia's apartment, it's probably going to be fine. It's probably not a big

**Luke Neverisky:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** deal. I don't know why you'all keep making a big deal out of it.

**Justin Hale:** I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, uh, something to the way I see your current plan happening is a concert in

**Justin Hale:** scared.

**Christopher Hooper:** the great hall, which is, um, goes directly from the like great uh, gate to the um, the forge gate. connecting to the four chart. And so what you know about that is that

**Justin Hale:** What is

**Christopher Hooper:** there is a great stone and

**Justin Hale:** it? Huh?

**Christopher Hooper:** iron Hi. Um there's a great stone and iron gate that separates the great hall from the forge heart. And that's going to be where you you'll need to deal with that at some point if that's your plan to go from the great hall to the forge heart. Um, and I I think you all know enough to know that you don't really have control of the ravers yet if you want to use them at this battle. Um, so you'll probably have to do more to to get

**Luke Neverisky:** All right, I just got to

**Christopher Hooper:** that closed up. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** continually play

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, you've got to play music till

**Luke Neverisky:** music.

**Christopher Hooper:** the day you die. And uh but and that's kind of I assumed where you're spending most of your time over the next couple days is um is infiltrating the raers and trying to to to fully control them and get them on your

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. So, we learned that there they congregate in

**Justin Hale:** What are the

**Luke Neverisky:** the under lake area and we happened or I happened to whatever

**Christopher Hooper:** side.

**Luke Neverisky:** capture jam whatever obviously just a small subsection that that happened to be at the the hollow at that

**Justin Hale:** things?

**Luke Neverisky:** time. So, okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** I was trying to listen harder and

**Luke Neverisky:** I hate when that

**Christopher Hooper:** instead I hung up.

**Luke Neverisky:** happens. So, we know that the Ravers had bangers, whatever, like they're primarily at the underllay. Uh I just happen to nab, you know, whoever happened to be the little hobble. That's a that's a small subset

**Justin Hale:** That's Right. Come on,

**Luke Neverisky:** fishision. Is that a correct assessment?

**Christopher Hooper:** It seemed like they were at the Little Havvel because of your concert there.

**Justin Hale:** baby.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and like what you what Helisana would know is that there are these Nexis around the city

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** that serve as points of control um over the raers. Little Havvel being one of them. And it seems like something is is at the under lake that is

**Luke Neverisky:** Got it.

**Christopher Hooper:** controlling them there.

**Luke Neverisky:** Okay. Uh the pelisan is that

**Ellis Taylor:** So we got to kill

**Justin Hale:** There's I'm asking

**Luke Neverisky:** she's going to want to prioritize that because more fans equals more ears for her music.

**Ellis Taylor:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, it's Justin with the background noise

**Justin Hale:** Oh, is

**Tyram:** Damn you,

**Christopher Hooper:** now.

**Justin Hale:** it? That's surprising. My AirPods usually cut all that out. Sorry,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** guys.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I think the singing was was too too

**Justin Hale:** So angelic and permeate.

**Christopher Hooper:** good this time.

**Tyram:** Justin.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yeah. So, you might have something in the underllay to fight if you want the raers help, but if you don't, then that's fine. You can just fight

**Luke Neverisky:** You

**Christopher Hooper:** the iron claws without

**Luke Neverisky:** guys, there are fans that haven't listened to my music lately. I'm going to want to f****** go

**Christopher Hooper:** them. Yeah, there's like a rock crowd that like isn't

**Luke Neverisky:** there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** But how do we how do we get them all

**Christopher Hooper:** indoctrinated by you

**Luke Neverisky:** What?

**Walden Briarhelm:** to come together for a another

**Luke Neverisky:** You just you just play anyway.

**Christopher Hooper:** yet.

**Luke Neverisky:** The day it'll

**Walden Briarhelm:** concert? Oh, you you you certainly are that famous. But how do we get more

**Luke Neverisky:** come. There's like this place some bunch of lake s*** where they they hang out and you know it's probably good. That's that that's what's the word I'm looking for? Uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** people? So, let's go into the sketchiest parts of the unders city and we will

**Justin Hale:** We can always radio

**Walden Briarhelm:** play a concert for your raas.

**Justin Hale:** broadcast

**Christopher Hooper:** I just said if you want pizza, you're going to have to pay a little extra for

**Tyram:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** it if you get my

**Walden Briarhelm:** Is the amount of ingredients available a good indicator of

**Christopher Hooper:** dread.

**Tyram:** I feel like I feel like you're

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** salad pizza? I am so excited. You keep talking about

**Ali Leonard:** our cheese is my

**Walden Briarhelm:** Omar's the almost the only one who doesn't get the reference like that doesn't have any other meaning. You're just

**Luke Neverisky:** But

**Tyram:** Well, I think there's a solid chance that Ellsworth wouldn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** like, "Wow, you guys are very into this cheese market.

**Ellis Taylor:** My

**Tyram:** know, but as a detective, surely Olivia would

**Ali Leonard:** favorite. For sure it doesn't.

**Tyram:** know. And as a criminal, surely Stilus would know. And Brew theoretically should know, but

**Ellis Taylor:** dear

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I don't think Brew would care about

**Tyram:** Brew's also like, you know, it it's

**Ellis Taylor:** probably. Think you can stop

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Tyram:** Yeah. like Drew like it's a it's a pretty eclectic mix of things he does

**Ellis Taylor:** looking

**Ellis Taylor:** for more than

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. And the owner currently is on a vacation and the torto Bernardo has been seeing

**Ali Leonard:** Early to

**Christopher Hooper:** after the establishment for the past six months. No one knows where the owner of Ratty's Pand has

**Tyram:** know. Ah damn it, another

**Ali Leonard:** That's

**Ellis Taylor:** enough. I mean, he is

**Christopher Hooper:** gone. No, that mystery. We don't care about that one.

**Ali Leonard:** Let's see the

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh I got rid of

**Tyram:** Good job. But don't wink. Don't ever

**Walden Briarhelm:** him. I'm sensing

**Ali Leonard:** waters.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that the wink is not well like and I am imagining like a

**Tyram:** wink.

**Walden Briarhelm:** really big like it's not

**Christopher Hooper:** like a whale's

**Tyram:** Okay. But hey, Olivia, I don't know if there's like the system

**Walden Briarhelm:** like a

**Christopher Hooper:** eye.

**Tyram:** in place for doing this right now, but you might consider getting a restraining order on this

**Walden Briarhelm:** small

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, for

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, yeah, I have it on my to-do list once

**Tyram:** guy.

**Ali Leonard:** sure. I mean, he's gonna

**Walden Briarhelm:** What

**Ellis Taylor:** once there's an actual like court system again. We'll

**Ali Leonard:** end up killing all of us.

**Ellis Taylor:** gave us this mystery.

**Christopher Hooper:** a detective just doing his job just because he doesn't like

**Walden Briarhelm:** happens?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, that that's the reason. That's

**Tyram:** You know, it's a lot more than I mean,

**Ali Leonard:** now. There's so many other

**Ellis Taylor:** No, he's he's a little too big of a

**Justin Hale:** absolutely the

**Tyram:** the pizza is honestly pretty high on my list for not liking this guy, but it's there's

**Justin Hale:** reason.

**Christopher Hooper:** pizza.

**Tyram:** other things, too, like his like figurines are pretty

**Ali Leonard:** reasons. The figurines are pretty number one for me.

**Tyram:** creepy. Um, he's he is a terrible detective. Just objectively a terrible detective.


### [01:30:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** fan. I mean, he did find out a lot of pretty good

**Tyram:** Well, maybe he should just like

**Ali Leonard:** He forgot

**Ellis Taylor:** stuff. when he came to questioning and then a lot of ill when

**Tyram:** stick to the maybe he should just stick to like the the

**Ellis Taylor:** basically when Poper was the top top what's

**Tyram:** paperwork part of being a detective because he's really bad at the the footwork part, you

**Ali Leonard:** it. The detective

**Ellis Taylor:** up he just needs he needs some learning Thanks.

**Ali Leonard:** part.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I will say that even as a monk who has had to rehearse prayer and mantra, it is weird that he speaks quotes directly

**Tyram:** know?

**Walden Briarhelm:** from Olivia Kubo many times. He seems to be crossing a line and the pizza

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, cool. So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** thing.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh, you found some apples and you found some cheese and your lettuce and blueberries in the freezer. You found a a sewer

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, the the

**Tyram:** right?

**Ali Leonard:** to check that out

**Christopher Hooper:** is like animemaniac style, like has like oh wolf hounds like uh you know dog like like sniffing around and trying to fight the

**Walden Briarhelm:** group.

**Luke Neverisky:** thing is

**Christopher Hooper:** and you can just make out an uh a little fire

**Ali Leonard:** one

**Christopher Hooper:** uh little fire light an encampment and you can see three

**Ali Leonard:** Here they

**Christopher Hooper:** figures. Um Brew especially with your passive perception can hear a little bit of a conversation happening. Um and you see three figures all huddled around this fire and they appear to be eating pizza and chatting uh pretty casually.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh to give you a better uh mind's eye view there are

**Ali Leonard:** comes

**Christopher Hooper:** these you know circular sewer ways and one is basically ending into this drop off that is basically drops off into this larger almost completely square room with um sewer sewer ways going um each cardinal direction into And when you peek down in, you see this encampment in the

**Luke Neverisky:** Got

**Christopher Hooper:** middle. And all around them, you see a couple tents. There's um a whole stack of crates beside them to the wall up to the side. Um and there are just ladders coming down the the sewer

**Justin Hale:** That's false advertising.

**Tyram:** I like it, but it's like,

**Christopher Hooper:** Most of Nashville is easy. It's just Broadway and like crossing from where I live to East Nashville is

**Tyram:** Franklin.

**Justin Hale:** my If you live in Nashville, it's probably

**Christopher Hooper:** like really

**Justin Hale:** fine. If you live on the outskirts, it's

**Christopher Hooper:** annoying. Yeah. Yeah, that's

**Tyram:** And I drive from Hendersonville to Brentwood for work every day. So it is

**Walden Briarhelm:** like

**Ellis Taylor:** horrible. It should be

**Christopher Hooper:** No, it's basically

**Ellis Taylor:** 30 minutes long. It's probably like what, an hour and a

**Justin Hale:** if three-hour round trip. Three.

**Tyram:** 35 minutes, but like if there is traffic, it's like at least an hour.

**Ellis Taylor:** half? Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** It used to be a three-hour round trip for me to go from Hendersonville to

**Ellis Taylor:** No,

**Justin Hale:** Printwood.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, now I understand more. This

**Christopher Hooper:** from

**Tyram:** Okay, so I heard a thing like uh on the radio recently were talking about like Nashville apparently ranked like 12th in like traffic and um how bad the traffic is in the United States. I'm genuinely shocked that it's not higher. But I think

**Walden Briarhelm:** I7.

**Ellis Taylor:** no, closing in on

**Tyram:** they were also counting places like LA and New York that you know, well, yeah, but like places like that at least have a good reason to have

**Ellis Taylor:** Atlanta and DC Traffic DC traffic starts at like 3:00 in the

**Justin Hale:** carnage?

**Christopher Hooper:** persuasion

**Tyram:** Okay. Are me or

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** check. Um,

**Tyram:** Helisana around to help persuade at this

**Christopher Hooper:** I think uh yeah, this is before you leave

**Justin Hale:** I'm going to ask for help

**Christopher Hooper:** potentially if Brew if Brew asked for your

**Ellis Taylor:** We crystals. Let's

**Justin Hale:** on that

**Christopher Hooper:** help. Okay.

**Tyram:** point? Okay. Um, I'll go up I'll go with Brew to to Pepsi. They're like, "No, you know, Brew, it's it's

**Justin Hale:** one.

**Tyram:** probably too much to ask of this young dragon because after all, we're going to a place of of battle, a place

**Ellis Taylor:** go.

**Tyram:** where a true dragon, a hardcore warrior would be able to prove themselves." I don't think that's Pepsi. No, Pepsi seem to doesn't seem to have what it takes to go to the

**Justin Hale:** And it it sounds

**Tyram:** hardcore kick-ass places that we're going

**Justin Hale:** like this may be a little too much for Pepsi. She might want to She might want to stay back for this

**Tyram:** to. I'm afraid so,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I think I understand. Yeah, we really wouldn't want Pepsi to come in and

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Walden Briarhelm:** take care of everything.

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Yeah. Enroll your persuasion

**Tyram:** Brew.

**Justin Hale:** one. Okay. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** give him advantage here if

**Tyram:** Uh oh. Okay. I I give you advantage

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Okay. The advantage is super helpful there. Um, we're going to use another flash of genius though to really drive it home. So, 18 + 5 would be

**Christopher Hooper:** you all right.

**Tyram:** for

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, you convince him. He says uh he just lazily sits in the freezer and lets you uh leave him there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** You're chilling the Pepsi is what we're

**Ellis Taylor:** He's got lots of frozen lettuce to eat. He's going to be

**Justin Hale:** 23. I think that I think the point

**Ali Leonard:** Leave the door

**Walden Briarhelm:** hearing.

**Ellis Taylor:** happy.

**Justin Hale:** was that we were trying to do reverse

**Tyram:** That was absolutely what we're trying to

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, well, he you persuaded him with the the what

**Tyram:** do.

**Ali Leonard:** open.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, I

**Christopher Hooper:** you said and he's like, "Yeah, probably got it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** caught

**Justin Hale:** psychology.

**Christopher Hooper:** Probably don't need to do this."

**Justin Hale:** All right, we'll we'll

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Ali Leonard:** healthwise and then then I did a

**Ellis Taylor:** Hey, come on.

**Justin Hale:** Bruise number one in

**Ali Leonard:** movement and then I'd like to bonus action tell

**Ellis Taylor:** There's number

**Tyram:** He cares greatly for Brew, but has very little respect

**Ali Leonard:** box to get off my

**Justin Hale:** here. Bruise number one in

**Christopher Hooper:** Fox is box. off your

**Tyram:** for

**Ali Leonard:** back. Yeah, I should have gotten him activated

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** back.

**Ali Leonard:** before now, but I didn't. So, I'm owning that

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** and that's a me mistake. So, he is now

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** case. Just a little

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. How about a How about a

**Ali Leonard:** robot. Doesn't have to be a robot. It could just be like a

**Walden Briarhelm:** tokens.

**Christopher Hooper:** quartz? All right.

**Ali Leonard:** dog. I love that. He would love

**Christopher Hooper:** There's your

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** corpse. All right. Yes, Silus, you're

**Ali Leonard:** Thank you little

**Ellis Taylor:** robot

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Ali Leonard:** buddy. Thank you little

**Tyram:** I can barely see the corpse. I will say they kind of blend in with the

**Luke Neverisky:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** That's why we always forget about

**Tyram:** background.

**Ali Leonard:** guy. I love it. It's great and it's very stealth and that's what we're going

**Christopher Hooper:** box. It just blends into the

**Ali Leonard:** to do. It's going for dead. He's always in

**Christopher Hooper:** background. All right, Silus, what are you going to do about

**Tyram:** Okay. Um I mean this gang person needs to f****** die. They

**Ali Leonard:** stealth.

**Christopher Hooper:** this?

**Tyram:** are like dishing out like 50 f****** damage a

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, and I'm standing in

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Tyram:** turn.

**Ali Leonard:** front of Teleson if that wasn't

**Ellis Taylor:** that or we need

**Christopher Hooper:** like um Okay. Like

**Tyram:** Um okay.

**Ali Leonard:** obvious. Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** to destroy his little

**Christopher Hooper:** there.

**Tyram:** So is going to try to like like kind of like move to the front. I'm assuming that like uh I was picturing like Silus in like the like the the biker chick position behind Olivia up to this point. So, I'm going to try to

**Ali Leonard:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** like position myself up to the front of Olivia so that I can attack uh

**Ellis Taylor:** plates.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Uh, you are you're in a tight spot.

**Tyram:** Kang. I'm a tiny little guy. I can like, you know, I got I don't need a lot

**Christopher Hooper:** So, I'm just saying um that

**Tyram:** of footholds here.

**Christopher Hooper:** would uh expose you like you'd be moving to the other side of Olivia thus like triggering opportunity attacks here.

**Tyram:** I can move through my allies. That is a specific thing that a

**Christopher Hooper:** It's not about that. It's about moving out of

**Tyram:** halfling can

**Christopher Hooper:** the uh out of

**Tyram:** do. I wouldn't be I'd just be moving like a

**Christopher Hooper:** the the rules of DND is you cannot occupy the same

**Tyram:** foot.

**Christopher Hooper:** space. Uh and so you are either in this space or you are in the one above

**Tyram:** Then I'll I'll just I'll throw knives at him then.

**Christopher Hooper:** her.

**Tyram:** Okay. I'm not blanking

**Luke Neverisky:** I think you would be flanking

**Tyram:** if I'm at a distance, which is why I was trying to move, but I still

**Luke Neverisky:** with but you are in an

**Tyram:** hit. I'm pretty sure a 23 hit, so I'm

**Luke Neverisky:** adjacent square if I'm looking at the map

**Tyram:** I'm good.

**Luke Neverisky:** correctly.

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Tyram:** Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** Thank you. That's

**Tyram:** 12

**Luke Neverisky:** lined

**Tyram:** 16. Okay, so my first attack does uh 24

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, all

**Tyram:** damage.

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** Psychic. Uh, no. I I rolled a

**Christopher Hooper:** That Okay,

**Tyram:** 23 and I did 24 damage.

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Tyram:** Yeah. And then, um, with my bonus action, I'm going to just I guess I'm just going to try to do more damage. I'm going to try to throw another dagger at her

**Christopher Hooper:** Are you doing sneak

**Tyram:** here. Uh, sneak attack was applied to

**Christopher Hooper:** attack? Okay, cool. Cool. Okay, there.

**Tyram:** that first attack. Yes. Yep. I I can

**Christopher Hooper:** Gotcha. I thought that was a

**Tyram:** do nowhere near 24 damage without sneak attack.

**Christopher Hooper:** great great

**Tyram:** The most I could possibly do without sneak

**Christopher Hooper:** damage. Okay, that makes sense.

**Tyram:** attack is 10. Um, which is less on this next attack, even if it does hit. Oh, but I

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. There you

**Tyram:** do have advantage now since I hit her with my Vex

**Christopher Hooper:** go.

**Tyram:** weapon. Uh, does

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yes.

**Tyram:** a 19 hit? Okay. All right. Um, seven

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. Seven damage. All right. Chipping away. Chipping

**Tyram:** damage. Yeah, I can't do sneak attack more than once a

**Christopher Hooper:** away.

**Tyram:** turn.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I forgot to keep we forgot to

**Tyram:** So, Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** see if um what's his name was toppled. Oh well, I forgot. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, which is technically better for

**Ellis Taylor:** okay. next

**Christopher Hooper:** Silus if he's doing range attacks.

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** time. Yes. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, um, so yeah, that's fine. Uh, cool. Uh, Silus, that is Do you want to

**Tyram:** I can't without getting attacked. So, I might as well

**Christopher Hooper:** move? It's not a good idea. No. All right, cool. Uh,

**Tyram:** stay here. So, yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Brew, you're up.

**Tyram:** Also, I want to stay in the uh the aura anyway.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** All right, I'm going to grab

**Tyram:** So,

**Justin Hale:** Kevin and we're going to move up

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Hi, I'm

**Justin Hale:** to here. So,

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin.

**Justin Hale:** boom. And I'm going to use Wait, I don't have to use it, do I? because I can move straight ahead. That's going to be I think everything I want to do actually hits from there. So that's perfect. Um I'm going to use

**Tyram:** f***.

**Justin Hale:** hex on Kang. And then

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** I'm going to uh So that does stuff for me, but it also does disadvantage. I'm going to do disadvantage on uh dexterity abilities and then

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, cool.

**Justin Hale:** does that take it takes my bonus action. Um so because I'm using hex from fay touch can I still

**Walden Briarhelm:** No.

**Justin Hale:** cast this

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Since you're using hex from fake. Yes. I I believe we said that

**Justin Hale:** spell? Okay. Um, I'm going to

**Christopher Hooper:** was Yes.

**Justin Hale:** cast. What was I going to

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** cast? This one. Yeah. Scorching

**Christopher Hooper:** Scorching

**Justin Hale:** ray. I make an

**Christopher Hooper:** ray

**Justin Hale:** attack. Yes, I do hits. Okay. Um. Okay. So, does this 14 hit?

**Christopher Hooper:** ill. What are you attacking? Uh, no.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Okay. How about a 26?

**Christopher Hooper:** 26

**Justin Hale:** Okay. And how about a

**Christopher Hooper:** heads and 18

**Justin Hale:** 18? Okay. So, Oh, wait. I don't make those separately.

**Christopher Hooper:** hits.

**Justin Hale:** That's just one.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, so you missed on the first

**Luke Neverisky:** I think they are in

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** one.

**Tyram:** scorching ray. Yeah, those are separate

**Luke Neverisky:** separate attacks, aren't they? You can you can hit mismiss or

**Justin Hale:** Each each

**Tyram:** attacks. Um, each ray is its own attack role.

**Justin Hale:** array is 2d6. Oh, perfect. Okay,

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** awesome. Um,

**Luke Neverisky:** something.

**Justin Hale:** uh, how does it work with this thing? I was not prepared for

**Tyram:** Yes.


### [03:30:00]

**Justin Hale:** that. My little plus thing. Where is it? Firearm one of your spells damage rolls. Okay, so it's 1 d8 for that. Okay, so that's going to be 2d6 plus a d8 for the first one. So that's going to be 10 fire damage and then another 10. So 20 fire damage plus what does hex do? Hex does an extra 1d6 of necrotic and then six necrotic

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Burn that

**Justin Hale:** damage. So 20 fire six necrotic and

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. All right.

**Ellis Taylor:** baby.

**Justin Hale:** then uh that that cube

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. Very good.

**Justin Hale:** is gone now but I can't there we

**Ellis Taylor:** that's on

**Justin Hale:** bonus action, but I used my bonus action for Hex that turn.

**Luke Neverisky:** you.

**Ellis Taylor:** go? Okay. 21 for

**Christopher Hooper:** All right, you need to be to

**Tyram:** Damn I

**Ellis Taylor:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** 17. Okay, Silus, you begin to feel a loss of control of your Um

**Tyram:** failed.

**Christopher Hooper:** body. you your speed is reduced to 10 feet and you have a disadvantage on decks and saving throws. Um all right, you are

**Ali Leonard:** When I'm in front of you with my arms out, but I'm

**Luke Neverisky:** Yagy. Um, well, I learned my

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Ali Leonard:** short. Seek cover behind

**Luke Neverisky:** lesson. Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** poopy.

**Tyram:** problems.

**Ali Leonard:** the rocks.

**Luke Neverisky:** maybe. Um, all right. So, uh, I'm going to cast mirror image. So, now you got, I think, four

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Luke Neverisky:** in total. Helisanas.

**Justin Hale:** That's too many

**Tyram:** Never enough

**Ali Leonard:** You have got to use that in the show

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, there's

**Ellis Taylor:** Too

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** Helisana. Well, in combat

**Ali Leonard:** though for

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** and on in the concert, sure, but like in like just like normal hanging out with

**Luke Neverisky:** obviously

**Justin Hale:** helis.

**Christopher Hooper:** This is

**Tyram:** Helisana, that's a lot of Helisana. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** sure. It's a lot of

**Luke Neverisky:** that's all

**Christopher Hooper:** the only time it's

**Ali Leonard:** She's going to mirror during the intervention and we're not going to know which one we're talking

**Ellis Taylor:** beauty.

**Luke Neverisky:** that's not supposed to know that. Um All right. And then

**Christopher Hooper:** allowed.

**Luke Neverisky:** um I will um am I still

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** to.

**Luke Neverisky:** feeling pretty good from the uh consumable? I feel like Okay. Um in that case, this thing's going to get a blast. Um I will try to hit once and I miss on the first bolt and I hit on the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Luke Neverisky:** second bolt with a 19. I'll do

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Luke Neverisky:** damage here. Um, that is a mighty six damage

**Christopher Hooper:** 96.

**Luke Neverisky:** to Kang. Um, and then as bonus action, uh, what's the range on juice? 60 ft. Okay, good. All right. Brew has the juice. Olivia is getting the

**Justin Hale:** Oh, damn. I forgot I have bar

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool.

**Justin Hale:** rolls.

**Tyram:** You can add it to attack rolls or saving throws,

**Luke Neverisky:** Um, right.

**Tyram:** I think, or skill shot.

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. A D20 test basically.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. Okay. I need to remember

**Tyram:** Yeah, there's a there's a specific kind of bar that would let you do damage rolls, but that's not what Hellison

**Justin Hale:** that. That was the nature board thing that I was with the

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah. Um, all right. And uh I'll keep my

**Justin Hale:** moes.

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Luke Neverisky:** distance here. So that'll be my

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** is.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia. All right, Olivia's going to roll

**Christopher Hooper:** sorry, one second. Um, I need Ellswith, Buu, and Helisana to give me a constitution saving throw.

**Ellis Taylor:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you

**Ali Leonard:** Rude. That's like not my

**Walden Briarhelm:** Olivia, rude.

**Luke Neverisky:** turn. Uh I feel

**Christopher Hooper:** see a cloud above you of psionic energy crackling and it rains down. Uh, the psionic uh, storm uh, creates these like black

**Ali Leonard:** vibe.

**Christopher Hooper:** venomous raindrops that fall on you. You need to beat a DC15 constitution saving

**Justin Hale:** Um, is this is this Kang doing

**Christopher Hooper:** throw. This is Kang doing

**Justin Hale:** that? Is Kang making

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Justin Hale:** eye eye contact with us as this is happening?

**Ali Leonard:** 19.

**Justin Hale:** Okay, I rolled a nat 20 and I also have plus six to constitution

**Ali Leonard:** Red

**Justin Hale:** saving throws. Can I like stick my tongue out and like drink this stuff

**Ellis Taylor:** Yay!

**Justin Hale:** and then like belch and look directly at Kang when it happens and intimidate

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. Yeah, for

**Tyram:** I mean, that's got to be at least like 1d6 psychic damage, right?

**Luke Neverisky:** Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** sure. I'll keep it in mind. Um, all right. Did

**Luke Neverisky:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** Let him roll a D4. Come

**Christopher Hooper:** it Did all uh did all three of you make that? All

**Luke Neverisky:** Uh, no. I

**Justin Hale:** him?

**Christopher Hooper:** right, Helisana, you are

**Walden Briarhelm:** No. Hell sana.

**Ellis Taylor:** on. Giggle this girl an

**Christopher Hooper:** poisoned.

**Walden Briarhelm:** No.

**Luke Neverisky:** failed. I poison myself on the regular

**Ellis Taylor:** umbrella.

**Luke Neverisky:** anyway. It's

**Justin Hale:** It's the

**Christopher Hooper:** Poisoned.

**Tyram:** Alisana doesn't even notice she

**Walden Briarhelm:** Tell those kind of perks

**Luke Neverisky:** fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, that means you have disadvantage

**Tyram:** was already high.

**Christopher Hooper:** on attack roles and ability

**Walden Briarhelm:** up. Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** checks. All right. Retired detective Olivia

**Walden Briarhelm:** no.

**Luke Neverisky:** disappears. That's

**Justin Hale:** same.

**Ellis Taylor:** All right, just going to

**Christopher Hooper:** Cooper.

**Ellis Taylor:** attack. Okay, let's see.

**Luke Neverisky:** good.

**Ellis Taylor:** So, the first one would be um

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, that hits.

**Ellis Taylor:** a 20 to hit. And then let's just check and see if this one also crits. Nope. So, it'll be a 26 to hit. I'll roll. And I'm going to

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** use another divine smite on

**Christopher Hooper:** So, um firstly,

**Ellis Taylor:** there.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh when you hit for the first time, she spits in your face. Uh I need you to make a dexterity saving there.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, I'm going to write these damages down 11

**Walden Briarhelm:** do not

**Ellis Taylor:** before I forget. Oh, my deck is not

**Christopher Hooper:** that

**Ellis Taylor:** good.

**Christopher Hooper:** fails. You get

**Ellis Taylor:** 13.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh seven acid damage and are blinded

**Walden Briarhelm:** like

**Christopher Hooper:** until your next turn. Uh blinded means that um uh attack rules against you have advantage and your attack has

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. So, I'm just neutral now then cuz I had advantage on

**Christopher Hooper:** disadvantage. Yes, that's

**Ellis Taylor:** Bob. Okay. Okay, so that was after my first attack. It was an 18 and I think the second roll is like a

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** 12. So with the plus eight, that still would have been a 20 to

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay,

**Ellis Taylor:** hit. So we'll keep both those damage and I'll roll with the 2d8. Um, that's six 26 damage on

**Christopher Hooper:** cool. Uh, nice. Very

**Ellis Taylor:** him.

**Christopher Hooper:** good. All right.

**Ellis Taylor:** And that's all my

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, it is getting late and uh I think we're about halfway through this battle.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Here we

**Christopher Hooper:** So, um I'm kind of thinking maybe this would

**Ellis Taylor:** stuff.

**Christopher Hooper:** be uh a good stopping point and I have the the progress saved here for me. Uh what do y'all

**Walden Briarhelm:** are.

**Justin Hale:** Let's call
