**Justin Hale:** retro gaming consoles. I highly recommend this one. It's called the TrimUI Brick. It's like 50 bucks right now on sale.

**Tyram:** It

**Justin Hale:** It's so dope. It's like a mini mini Game

**Tyram:** looks like a Game Boy Zoom

**Justin Hale:** Boy. Yeah, it's freaking amazing though. It plays everything up to like PlayStation one, including DS

**Tyram:** hybrid.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Portable chrono trigger sounds

**Justin Hale:** games. Yep. I beat uh Chrono Trigger on the DS on that thing. I don't recommend it. The dual screen is not fun for that

**Walden Briarhelm:** good. Oh, does it cut the map in

**Justin Hale:** game. You have to

**Walden Briarhelm:** half?

**Justin Hale:** like the the way they set up. It's probably good on a dual screen device where you can touch it, but like the maps on the bottom and then all of the um all of the menu items are on the bottom. So, you have to like tap them to

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes. One

**Justin Hale:** get into them. So like items and party configuration and all that stuff is a

**Walden Briarhelm:** Got

**Justin Hale:** pain in the butt from that perspective. Again, probably amazing

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Justin Hale:** on the actual DS light, but freaking annoying

**Ellis Taylor:** more

**Justin Hale:** otherwise.

**Ellis Taylor:** second.

**Tyram:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** We're not waiting on me. We're waiting on

**Tyram:** okay. I had that completely backwards. My bad.

**Ellis Taylor:** It was

**Christopher Hooper:** you. I just had to tell Astid how sick of Ethan I

**Tyram:** Okay. All right.

**Justin Hale:** You don't know who this is, but we're sick of him. Be sick of

**Christopher Hooper:** was. Remember that,

**Justin Hale:** him. If you hear the name If

**Tyram:** I I do wonder if they'll ever actually be in the same room at the same time

**Justin Hale:** you hear the name Exactly.

**Tyram:** because there's a good chance the answer is no.

**Ellis Taylor:** absolutely worse.

**Christopher Hooper:** Astrid. Very unlikely. I haven't been in the same room in deepen in probably a

**Tyram:** Yeah, that sounds about

**Ellis Taylor:** I don't think I don't think I've seen him since high

**Justin Hale:** I've never met and I'm sick

**Tyram:** right. That might be right. Oh

**Ellis Taylor:** school.

**Tyram:** well. But anyway, okay. So, let's set up the framing device for tonight's episode. Um, as Silas and Brew are uh combing over the

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** decade.

**Justin Hale:** of

**Tyram:** dragon's horde, recovering the Bugatti, uh, teaming up with Pepsi, and, you know, establishing a lifelong and cherished friendship. Um, you might recall that Brew and Silas briefly like, you know, poured one out for their friends in the Simus

**Ellis Taylor:** That

**Tyram:** circle. And I'm going to say that um as they were doing that um Silas starts to reminisce about the last time they were all together. And so now we enter the flashback which shall serve as basically this whole episode. Um, in Silas's memory, he is uh sitting in the old bar that the Sisphus circle used to hang out in, which um damn it. Sorry, I need to pull I got I had this up earlier, but then I forgot. Close it. So, give me a sec.

**Ellis Taylor:** It's not

**Tyram:** But he sits at the window of the bar on the top floor of a relatively tall building and he looks out to uh this panoramic view of the Dne

**Ellis Taylor:** about

**Tyram:** Zoo back in Grreyport. Um he sees a lot of the strange and wonderful creatures that make up the zoo. And Silus has come to particularly enjoy um this view from the from the window. Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** What is

**Tyram:** he sees the uh manager of the zoo, a chimera named Fufu Cuddly Poops, going around and uh making

**Ellis Taylor:** that?

**Tyram:** sure all the exhibits are in order. He sees a petting zoo with a bunch of kids petting owl bears. An unremarkable site really considering that owl bears are famous for being completely agreeable, but um still pleasant to see. and he sees the statue of a strange little gnome lady um standing next to a wolf at a memorial spot at the entrance to the zoo. Well, she does have like a wooden leg if I remember correctly from the end of the

**Ellis Taylor:** Strange. Oh,

**Tyram:** campaign.

**Ellis Taylor:** yeah. I forgot about that. So, she's rad as

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. But

**Ellis Taylor:** hell.

**Tyram:** um um they're also somewhat it's a pretty good hangout spot because it's also fairly near to the uh Joel Gresham Amphitheater, the second best venue hands down in all of Greport. You can probably guess who the first best one is named after. But um but um as um Silas is staring out the window, he suddenly hears the leader of their little gang um their Sander. Let's call everyone's attention. Let's go around the bar and meet all the different members of the gang here. Um skipping brew, who cares? But no, no. Well, actually, sorry. Let's let actually let's start with Brew. What's Brew up to right

**Justin Hale:** Ah, Brew is probably uh other than pestering Silus, he's probably sitting at the bar tinkering on um on Kevin, fixing Kevin up with his newest upgrades. Deep in thought,

**Tyram:** now?

**Justin Hale:** uh probably let's say he's making Kevin. This is the

**Tyram:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** This is the introduction of Kevin. He's finalizing Kevin.

**Tyram:** man, this is a monumental moment.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, I'm Kevin. I'm

**Tyram:** Okay. The Cog and

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin. I'm

**Tyram:** Steam is the name of the bar. Sorry, that's what All

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin.

**Tyram:** right. horrifying. Okay. But yeah, um I guess let's go around and meet the rest of the gang. Um we'll just go uh counterclockwise from my position. So, um let's start with Toeer.

**Justin Hale:** indeed.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um Alma is um getting uh just uh coming back to the group with two beers. Uh one for the sander uh late puts it in front of her brother. Uh the sander, here you go. I got us a couple

**Ali Leonard:** You're the key

**Christopher Hooper:** brews. And

**Tyram:** That's the voice you're going with.

**Ali Leonard:** to this entire operation. It's going to be deeper, but I was laughing.

**Christopher Hooper:** um um and then Alma uh sits

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** down. Uh she is um blonde hair. Um she wears contacts or something like that. Uh she has corrective vision. Um, and she has a uh red polka dot dress. Is Zach, are you actually in a

**Walden Briarhelm:** Just vary into the character here.

**Christopher Hooper:** car?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** No. Okay. Very cool. All right. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Good

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice. Um, and uh and uh says, "Oh, bro, little Kevin's

**Tyram:** touch.

**Christopher Hooper:** looking great." Um and uh gives him a little gives Kevin a little wink. Um Kevin. Oh goodness me. Uh and starts drinking her

**Justin Hale:** Sorry, I had to

**Christopher Hooper:** beer. Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** give my dad his medicine.

**Tyram:** All right, next on my

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** clockwise rotation here, we do have uh Ally with their

**Ali Leonard:** I did make an image of

**Tyram:** sander.

**Ali Leonard:** thirstander in my brain. So, we could be half siblings if you don't want to be a dwarf.

**Christopher Hooper:** No, that's

**Ali Leonard:** Um, but let me see. Where did they go? I liked this one. And

**Christopher Hooper:** fine.

**Tyram:** Oh man, is that younger Brew with like a head full of

**Ali Leonard:** then I don't know who that is.

**Tyram:** hair? That's delightful, actually.

**Ellis Taylor:** That's so

**Ali Leonard:** At first I was thinking about being an elf and it was weird because that this is what I

**Ellis Taylor:** cute.

**Tyram:** Oh

**Ali Leonard:** got. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Yeah. Very very

**Tyram:** Christ. Oh, that is a cursed image. I hate

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah. It's very hard.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Elf on a

**Christopher Hooper:** difficult.

**Justin Hale:** Just

**Ellis Taylor:** shelf. I mean, that's what Elf on the Shelf is really.

**Christopher Hooper:** And

**Justin Hale:** kidding. That's what we all look like

**Tyram:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** Um, yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** It's just capitalism.

**Ali Leonard:** So, yeah. So, I was thinking there Sander just has just like a bunch of papers around

**Justin Hale:** now.

**Ali Leonard:** him and he's like constantly scribbling and there's like all these codes. You have no idea what they mean. And I don't think he exactly knows what they mean, but it looks like super intense. And there's like a building schematic in front of you. I think with three


### [00:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** then

**Ali Leonard:** floors, chugs the

**Christopher Hooper:** Alma uh had put one of the beer glasses like right on one of the

**Ali Leonard:** beer. It's fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. And then he takes it and chugs the

**Christopher Hooper:** papers. Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** beer. No, you're

**Christopher Hooper:** sorry. And did I mess up your little

**Ali Leonard:** you're amazing and and you're the face of this operation and I'm so happy to have you here. You can do nothing

**Christopher Hooper:** drawings? A shucks. Thank you,

**Tyram:** You guys uh

**Christopher Hooper:** bro. You,

**Tyram:** could be like adopted siblings if you want to do like the human and dwarf thing.

**Ali Leonard:** wrong. You get whatever you

**Christopher Hooper:** too. I don't think I said I was human. Just that I had blonde hair and a polka dot

**Tyram:** Yes, that's the most human description I've ever heard in my

**Ali Leonard:** want. Yeah. You do whatever

**Christopher Hooper:** dot red

**Ali Leonard:** race. He's um a little stressed like he always is before a

**Christopher Hooper:** dress.

**Ali Leonard:** job, but he's just like he cares too much. You know what I

**Tyram:** life.

**Ali Leonard:** mean? Just wasn't all

**Ellis Taylor:** I give you a second

**Christopher Hooper:** The Santa, it's going to

**Ali Leonard:** right. They always work

**Christopher Hooper:** be okay. Your plans always work

**Tyram:** Okay, moving on. We have uh Zach playing

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Tyram:** the role of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh

**Ellis Taylor:** chance. You just

**Walden Briarhelm:** imagining Spoons as a a human.

**Ellis Taylor:** lost

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, average height, uh, bald. He's got like the Vin

**Ali Leonard:** out. Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** Diesel going on. Um, he's wearing fingerless

**Tyram:** spoons.

**Ali Leonard:** yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** gloves. Somebody just drove by and hammered the gas and it's perfect for this moment. And he's got the

**Ellis Taylor:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** fingerless gloves. He's got some sunglasses to keep the light out of his eyes. And uh while everybody's drinking beer, he's to stay sober because he ain't drinking and driving. That's one line he crossed. And uh instead, he's ordered a uh a tall

**Ali Leonard:** That

**Walden Briarhelm:** coffee and he's sitting there kind of you can see he's maybe had a little too

**Ali Leonard:** movie.

**Walden Briarhelm:** much caffeine. And he's uh he's not he doesn't say a lot. If he ain't drinking coffee, he's chewing on like a toothpick or

**Justin Hale:** I'm sorry. Or you're not drinking Corona.

**Walden Briarhelm:** something. And uh as he's just uh looking around the table, he's uh you know, just making sure everything's good. Being the sober one, he's like, "Uh, hey, uh Andy, are you ready for this? You you got me a little worried. You seem a little

**Ali Leonard:** Watch. This is I'm always like

**Ellis Taylor:** behavior.

**Walden Briarhelm:** nervous.

**Ali Leonard:** this. This is fine. We'll be fine. Everything will be

**Tyram:** I love the characterization of our leader as like this neurotic

**Ali Leonard:** fine. Everything will be

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I like the confidence. And

**Tyram:** mess.

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh uh Alma, you're looking good. I like the dress. Uh yeah, I'll get you all out of there

**Christopher Hooper:** Spoons. Oh, I know you

**Walden Briarhelm:** time. And at that

**Christopher Hooper:** will, Spoons. You're a great

**Walden Briarhelm:** point, Spoons pulls out a spoon from his pocket and grabs a sugar

**Christopher Hooper:** driver.

**Ali Leonard:** Come out

**Walden Briarhelm:** cube and drops it in his coffee and starts

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that's what I Oh,

**Tyram:** Yeah. All right. And that leaves

**Walden Briarhelm:** stir. Uh that'll that'll be my intro.

**Christopher Hooper:** nice.

**Ali Leonard:** up. Hello

**Ellis Taylor:** evening. And Peaches is sitting next to her. He is a big half orc um behemoth of a guy. But he's just sitting there finally fiddling and creating these teeny tiny little wire sculptures of

**Ellis Taylor:** between like between like this

**Tyram:** stage. Sorry. Say

**Ellis Taylor:** campaign and Brute maybe Brute just never remembers. has to be reminded every day

**Tyram:** Honestly, I like that explanation that like

**Ellis Taylor:** what your name

**Tyram:** uh every time Silus changes his name, Brew's like, "Oh, I must have misremembered his

**Christopher Hooper:** I love it. It's

**Justin Hale:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** great. It's great.

**Ellis Taylor:** person.

**Christopher Hooper:** What are you saying, Cream? You what? You want to take the the top of the door? What do you

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm saying I

**Christopher Hooper:** want to do?

**Ellis Taylor:** could see it either way. We can figure out something to do with Peaches.

**Tyram:** Well, we

**Ellis Taylor:** Like, do we have a bag of holding?

**Tyram:** got the portable

**Ellis Taylor:** Maybe we do have a hole. That is true. Peaches pulls it out of his pocket, Peaches. and like puts it back

**Justin Hale:** Oh yeah, that's the a-hole. And if you look

**Tyram:** hole. Damn it,

**Justin Hale:** close, there's an A scribbled on like a tag on it. What? It makes it more fun. It's so

**Tyram:** Brew. Also, Peaches, that's supposed to be the equipment locker. It's not

**Justin Hale:** boring with you guys sometimes.

**Tyram:** yours.

**Ellis Taylor:** in. He just looks at you. Just stares at you

**Tyram:** Well

**Ellis Taylor:** and doesn't

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, peaches. If we go

**Ellis Taylor:** blink.

**Christopher Hooper:** to the to the sewers, can I just hide in the a-hole? I don't want to get dirty. So, I feel like in a clean a-hole, it'll be nice and

**Justin Hale:** You're welcome,

**Tyram:** argued.

**Christopher Hooper:** safe. Oh, pretty please.

**Justin Hale:** Taylor.

**Tyram:** Well, if I remember

**Walden Briarhelm:** gun.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, okay. Fine. We'll take the sewers. But I'm going to

**Justin Hale:** know.

**Ali Leonard:** So if we go from the top, we have to sneak past the bosses.

**Walden Briarhelm:** what you're

**Christopher Hooper:** mission. I I

**Ali Leonard:** If we sneak from the bottom, we have to go past the

**Walden Briarhelm:** thinking.

**Ali Leonard:** noobs. I would say we go past the

**Ellis Taylor:** or the secret

**Christopher Hooper:** I thought we were going to take

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, let's go past the

**Ali Leonard:** noobs. That's what I mean. We go sewer and then up and then you

**Ellis Taylor:** tunnel. Hey, there's there's

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Ali Leonard:** see cuz the noobs are the first we do have to go up pass into the

**Christopher Hooper:** seas.

**Ellis Taylor:** all

**Christopher Hooper:** My god, Anda, I don't know what

**Justin Hale:** boobs. If we're going in the sewer, let's We need to go that

**Tyram:** Um, so you guys

**Ali Leonard:** second. We have to end on the

**Ellis Taylor:** where the buildings

**Christopher Hooper:** you're talking about. Just tell me what to do.

**Tyram:** can see the uh the building from where you are. Um, there's a

**Justin Hale:** way.

**Tyram:** big like set of double doors, which is like, you know, just a seemingly normal looking front door. Um, the second floor, which you guys know to be where the vault is, has no

**Ali Leonard:** second

**Tyram:** windows. And then there's a top floor which does have a bunch of windows. And you can see kind of like the town houses around here all have like a roof access door. So, and then what you can't see from the

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** street is that there is like a basement entrance. That's just kind of like, you know, the reason you guys know about that is because, you know, just thieves passing secrets

**Ali Leonard:** It's the

**Tyram:** about like, you know, uh, different

**Ali Leonard:** code.

**Tyram:** ways to move about in the underground of the city and

**Justin Hale:** Is there is there windows from one of the

**Tyram:** stuff. Yes,

**Justin Hale:** adjacent buildings facing the windows of the building we're trying to get

**Tyram:** there would be

**Justin Hale:** into? Who is the grapple hook?

**Ellis Taylor:** That's Spoon.

**Justin Hale:** We can we can throw grapple hook

**Ali Leonard:** from the second floor to second

**Justin Hale:** from one of those windows. So, one of those

**Ali Leonard:** floor.

**Justin Hale:** windows and then we and then we slide back real real like

**Ali Leonard:** store. Would it have to break the

**Justin Hale:** secret agent

**Ali Leonard:** window? No, it goes in the

**Ellis Taylor:** What are the walls made

**Justin Hale:** style. Yes. What do

**Ali Leonard:** wall.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think the walls are made of

**Ali Leonard:** Play-Doh. Probably brick, but maybe

**Justin Hale:** you play the

**Christopher Hooper:** Play-Doh. No, like the poet. I think the poet wrote some

**Ali Leonard:** Play-Doh.

**Ellis Taylor:** of?

**Christopher Hooper:** like really like some really strong brick.

**Ali Leonard:** Learn something new every

**Christopher Hooper:** It's really hard to click onto. I talked to him. He told me about Pandora. I'm really worried about this thing cuz

**Christopher Hooper:** they say when you open Pandora like the devil gets you or

**Ali Leonard:** day. Can't put it back in the box once you pop. You just can't

**Christopher Hooper:** something.

**Ali Leonard:** stop.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, once you pop you can't stop. A bunch of potato chips. You know what I'm saying?

**Justin Hale:** using? They don't make any sense. Play-Doh's

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Yay. It's from the

**Justin Hale:** Play-Doh. What is What is

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah, I get it. I finally get

**Christopher Hooper:** geeks.

**Justin Hale:** happening? From what? from the from the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, the geeks at the box and you don't open the

**Ali Leonard:** it. You don't open the box. They always ask what's in the

**Justin Hale:** kinkos. All right.

**Ali Leonard:** box. You don't open it.

**Christopher Hooper:** box. Yeah, the devil's in the

**Justin Hale:** So, the table. All right. How do How do you fit a table in a

**Ali Leonard:** Just real

**Christopher Hooper:** box. Listen, the sins of our Lord in the box and if you open them, they spread all over the world and sending me hell. So, the

**Justin Hale:** box in a little box?

**Christopher Hooper:** grappling hook's not going to work on the wall cuz a play-doh.

**Tyram:** I was picturing like a Batman style

**Justin Hale:** But we shoot it through a

**Tyram:** grappling hook that like hooked itself into like walls and stuff.

**Ali Leonard:** small in the wall. And then you go. Yeah. So, we could try it. My only

**Justin Hale:** window. Yeah. This is a

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** plate. This is a Plato grappling hook. This is specifically designed

**Tyram:** Oh, I'm gonna say through Sander that you had this

**Justin Hale:** for Play-Doh's Play-Doh

**Tyram:** grapple hook special made at uh Luke's

**Justin Hale:** bricks.

**Tyram:** uh famous uh mechanical shop. It

**Ali Leonard:** worry. And it has

**Tyram:** was uh put together by the guy who runs the shop now, a grizzled old looking

**Ali Leonard:** his signature on it.

**Tyram:** guy called

**Ellis Taylor:** access. Oh, nice.

**Tyram:** Iro. And dragons can take human form.

**Ali Leonard:** He's all glowed

**Ellis Taylor:** A a

### [00:50:00]

**Ali Leonard:** up. He's all

**Tyram:** He's

**Ali Leonard:** glown

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh my heart. So Peaches is going to like elbow through and be like, "Peaches." And K's going to be like, "Oh

**Justin Hale:** Yes, exactly. We use grapple

**Ali Leonard:** up.

**Ellis Taylor:** my gosh, yes, he gave you the hole." Oh my god. We could like

**Justin Hale:** hook.

**Tyram:** like

**Ellis Taylor:** grab a hook, slide over, throw the hole on the wall, and just go straight into the second

**Tyram:** Oh. Um the hole does not work like that.

**Ali Leonard:** What are

**Ellis Taylor:** floor. What?

**Tyram:** The hole creates an extra dimen dimensional space like a

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, the hole doesn't work like

**Tyram:** bag of holding does. It doesn't just like it's not like a Looney Tunes hole where like you create like a hole in a wall or something like that. It's

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I thought I create a hole in the

**Tyram:** it's basically just like a foldable bag of holding. The main difference between it

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Tyram:** and the bag is that um the portable hole can be

**Ali Leonard:** you?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** folded into a smaller size and it creates a bigger surface area for you to put stuff in, but it's less practical to move around than a bag of whole thing would

**Justin Hale:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** be.

**Justin Hale:** we peaches. We can't use the cornhole. That's why I made this portal gun. No, I'm just

**Tyram:** That wasn't that wasn't one of the

**Justin Hale:** kidding. You said I'm an artificer. I can make whatever I want.

**Tyram:** proposed. There are actual rules about what the art of piss or can

**Christopher Hooper:** That's what you said,

**Tyram:** and cannot make.

**Justin Hale:** Taylor, make make up your mind. Taylor, make up your

**Tyram:** I never said you can have a f****** portal

**Ellis Taylor:** What happened?

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor.

**Tyram:** gun. Toeer, do you want him to have a portal

**Christopher Hooper:** Wow. Wow. So classic.

**Tyram:** gun? Because theoretically he could have it. when you take over again

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor, listen. I'm not a DM right now. I'm a player and I think you should have it.

**Tyram:** too. Okay, I'm going to say no on the portal gun.

**Justin Hale:** mind. I feel

**Tyram:** Although there was that item in the D and D movie that was basically a portal gun.

**Justin Hale:** like the implications of giving me a portal gun.

**Tyram:** That would be a pretty cool like magic item to have at some

**Justin Hale:** I still haven't You know what? I should

**Tyram:** point. It's It's solid. It's It's a lot of

**Justin Hale:** download that and watch it on the plane.

**Tyram:** fun.

**Walden Briarhelm:** The hither tither. Is that what you're talking

**Justin Hale:** Dola, you know

**Tyram:** Sorry, I had no idea what you just

**Walden Briarhelm:** about? The the hither tither staff. Is that what you're

**Tyram:** said. Yes, the hither

**Walden Briarhelm:** talking

**Christopher Hooper:** Zach, what happened to your beautiful

**Tyram:** staff.

**Walden Briarhelm:** about? I can go grab

**Christopher Hooper:** mic? The mic that gave

**Justin Hale:** what?

**Christopher Hooper:** you crystal clear

**Justin Hale:** What happened to your super

**Ali Leonard:** Eater.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. All right, guys. cuz I got to use the bathroom

**Christopher Hooper:** vocals. Yeah, it was made you super

**Justin Hale:** sexy

**Tyram:** Damn it,

**Christopher Hooper:** sexy.

**Justin Hale:** mic? Spoon, just just just

**Tyram:** Spoons. Okay, so we need to talk to

**Ellis Taylor:** Just simple.

**Justin Hale:** piss yourself,

**Tyram:** Alma about her drinking and we need to talk to Spoons about his just constant He needs to see a doctor. He's going to the bathroom way too

**Justin Hale:** man, hydrating. Yeah,

**Tyram:** often, honestly. Yeah, I'm worried. I think he needs to get that

**Justin Hale:** his his prostate has to be like the size of a grapefruit or

**Tyram:** checked out.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, like that's a real problem.

**Justin Hale:** something. The thing has to be

**Tyram:** you have a real problem,

**Ali Leonard:** Let's add it to the

**Christopher Hooper:** Like I don't even have one.

**Justin Hale:** huge. You You have a

**Ellis Taylor:** We all had misty step,

**Justin Hale:** real problem. He has a mythical

**Tyram:** too. Uh, I'm going to say no. Like

**Ellis Taylor:** right? Okay.

**Tyram:** that came from like our party interacting with,

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh yeah, that came from something

**Tyram:** you know, the FA world. And I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that these characters

**Ellis Taylor:** specific.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, come on, Bam. You remember when

**Justin Hale:** problem.

**Ali Leonard:** intervention. You love the thing.

**Christopher Hooper:** we traveled in the fay

**Tyram:** have Oh s***, that's right. Yeah. No,

**Ali Leonard:** Yep.

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** it. All right. So, we're going to use Aristotle's grappling gun on Plato's brick wall. Got it. We're not going to worry about the geeks Pandora's box. Got it. And

**Ali Leonard:** Not

**Christopher Hooper:** we're not going to 360 nocope these noobs. Got

**Tyram:** None of us have a sniper rifle, so that doesn't even make sense in the first

**Christopher Hooper:** it. You don't even need a sniper rifle because it's You don't even

**Justin Hale:** Now you're just talking

**Tyram:** place.

**Ali Leonard:** yet. Yeah. I don't think

**Christopher Hooper:** need the scope. You just need something 50

**Justin Hale:** nonsense.

**Tyram:** If it's a gun that doesn't normally have a scope, there's no

**Ali Leonard:** you're understanding that though it's no scope. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** caliber.

**Tyram:** point in calling out it being no

**Ali Leonard:** 360.

**Christopher Hooper:** Why would you

**Justin Hale:** All right.

**Tyram:** scope because

**Christopher Hooper:** spin 30 360

**Justin Hale:** Yes.

**Tyram:** it looks cool, I

**Christopher Hooper:** degrees?

**Justin Hale:** I don't think that's the part you need to focus

**Christopher Hooper:** What part are you focusing in

**Justin Hale:** on the no scope part. The part the

**Tyram:** guess. Hey, look guys. We have an hour and 15 minutes

**Justin Hale:** lack of scope

**Tyram:** to fit in this entire adventure and we've barely gotten started. So

**Christopher Hooper:** on?

**Justin Hale:** skill.

**Tyram:** maybe no more talk about 360

**Christopher Hooper:** Bro,

**Justin Hale:** So we

**Christopher Hooper:** why did you put the timer as an hour and 15 minutes on a

**Justin Hale:** use

**Ali Leonard:** classic. And then you can't I

**Christopher Hooper:** bomb?

**Tyram:** nocopes. That extra pressure really is

**Ali Leonard:** forgot you can't undo that once you do it.

**Justin Hale:** right. I can I can undo

**Tyram:** the success here, you know.

**Justin Hale:** ate it. Now you can't save it. Lower my dead

**Ali Leonard:** it. You know it takes him like three days to

**Justin Hale:** body.

**Tyram:** right. Um, where are you aiming to land on the opposite side

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool.

**Tyram:** here?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so I think I think the goal is like to try to get to like the rooftop so we can like let everyone out and then like be able to traverse from there. And then also like if it's higher, it

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, yeah, you guys

**Christopher Hooper:** helps us with the grappling hook,

**Tyram:** launched the grappling hook. Um, just give me a um a ranged attack roll pretty low AC here to see if you manage to uh land it pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So, um this would be with everyone led out and so their sander has a

**Tyram:** well. Okay, sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** grappling hook, so she should be able to do

**Tyram:** You are muted,

**Ali Leonard:** I do it. I'm just shooting my

**Tyram:** Ally. Some things carry over between characters,

**Ali Leonard:** gun basically.

**Tyram:** it seems. Yeah. Shoot your

**Ali Leonard:** Right. Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** yeah. Can I get

**Tyram:** gun. All right. you uh you hit

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** precisely where you want it to go. And yeah, you guys, I'm going to say that the

**Ali Leonard:** 25?

**Tyram:** grappling hook is able to establish like a like a zip line between uh the two roofs here. Arthur, you look so consternated. What's going

**Christopher Hooper:** There's two of

**Ellis Taylor:** It says there's two of me. Does it do that for

**Tyram:** on?

**Christopher Hooper:** her.

**Ellis Taylor:** you, too? I

**Tyram:** Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** don't know what's going

**Ali Leonard:** We did

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep. All right, cool. Zipline to the other building. Oh my god, you did it. Good job.

**Ali Leonard:** Yes. And then we

**Tyram:** Okay, you guys are able you guys do a kickass

**Ellis Taylor:** on. Yay.

**Tyram:** like zipline like um I'm going to say you guys are well practiced at this. You all have like oh the other uh the other Martha though. But yeah, you guys

**Ali Leonard:** zipline. We do this all the

**Tyram:** like do your little sashes across the

**Ali Leonard:** time.

**Tyram:** zipline. Although you guys are like really quiet about it because it's uh people can tell you're having fun, you

**Christopher Hooper:** Wee. Yeah.

**Tyram:** know. All right, you guys have made it over to the

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. So, how do we get to the sewer from

**Ali Leonard:** No, I think we're skip. I think we changed it entirely. We're

**Tyram:** roof.

**Ali Leonard:** skipping the zoomer.

**Christopher Hooper:** here? Oh my god, I could have kept my dress

**Tyram:** I mean, we're still

**Ali Leonard:** could have.

**Christopher Hooper:** on.

**Tyram:** doing like, you know, physical activity. Probably best to have the jumpsuit on

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. Looks a lot worse,

**Tyram:** anyway. I mean, everyone could have looked up your dress while you were doing the

**Christopher Hooper:** though. That's

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. It's true. Hey, teachers. Come on. We can't just do the zipline the whole time. That's not why we're

**Tyram:** zipline.

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Ali Leonard:** He was only here for the zipline. He said that

**Christopher Hooper:** It's

**Ellis Taylor:** Peaches. Peaches just looks poor for Laurenly back at the other side. Like, man, I wish I could go

**Ali Leonard:** before. But that's why we have the zipline in the bar.

**Christopher Hooper:** not

**Ali Leonard:** We'll just zipline when we get

**Ellis Taylor:** again.

**Ali Leonard:** back

**Tyram:** man. We're

**Ellis Taylor:** Peaches. Peaches. Peaches.

**Tyram:** guys.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I'll be

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Justin Hale:** All right. So, we're in front of the vault

**Walden Briarhelm:** there.

**Justin Hale:** room door wall. Is that

**Tyram:** Um, you got Okay, so

**Ali Leonard:** We zipline to the second floor. So now we're looking for the

**Tyram:** you guys zipline to the second floor. Um, you guys are uh kind of just like hanging on the side of the building. You guys still need to get inside

**Ali Leonard:** vault. We're all

**Tyram:** somehow.

**Ali Leonard:** just hanging out. Okay, let's get in the building. We could have had this conversation inside. Let's go,

**Justin Hale:** right? Why? Why haven't we gone in yet and had all these all these

**Tyram:** Yeah, we're being a little loosey goosey with the timing here, I guess. But, um, as of right now, there's no windows or anything into the second floor. How are you guys getting

**Ali Leonard:** guys. I for the window this whole

**Justin Hale:** conversations? That's

**Tyram:** in? I never heard

**Ali Leonard:** time.

**Justin Hale:** what is that what we talked

**Tyram:** that. Okay. Sorry. breakdown in

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, there's a

**Tyram:** communication. No,

**Ali Leonard:** Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** window to the sewer. That's what I was saying the whole

**Justin Hale:** about? Okay.

**Tyram:** there's windows on the first floor and the third floor, but not the second floor. They intentionally did not want people

**Christopher Hooper:** time.

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Tyram:** to be able to see into this uh this secure


### [01:10:00]

**Ali Leonard:** god. They're

**Tyram:** location. Yes, I guess

**Ali Leonard:** just hanging on to the

**Justin Hale:** okay. No, we are clearly the plan that we already talked about from earlier was

**Tyram:** so.

**Justin Hale:** that we were we were grapple hooking to the third floor and

**Ali Leonard:** wall. The third floor has the bosses. I

**Justin Hale:** then we were going to somehow get to the second

**Ali Leonard:** don't want to fight

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, why

**Justin Hale:** floor. That that is why I said the first

**Christopher Hooper:** don't we frontload the bosses while we have spell slots and

**Tyram:** Elm, if you say

**Ali Leonard:** Pandora. Why do I have a

**Christopher Hooper:** we can 360 no scope them, you

**Justin Hale:** four. Show Show me

**Tyram:** 360 nocope one more goddamn time, I am going to lose

**Ali Leonard:** plan?

**Christopher Hooper:** know?

**Justin Hale:** this

**Tyram:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I mean

**Tyram:** Okay. Okay. So, alternatively, we could try to decide on

**Christopher Hooper:** fireball.

**Tyram:** a way to breach the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I know somebody

**Justin Hale:** guy. Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** who's real good with that. Hey, Peaches. I look

**Justin Hale:** yeah.

**Tyram:** wall, which is

**Walden Briarhelm:** over Brew. Hey,

**Justin Hale:** You see you see

**Walden Briarhelm:** Peaches. Oh, well, Peaches. Peaches looks like she's taking a break. I guess Brew maybe you know something about I don't know how to demolition a wall. You know anything about

**Justin Hale:** where it's my time to

**Tyram:** Europe. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** If we do, I'm just going to be the bad

**Walden Briarhelm:** it?

**Justin Hale:** shine.

**Ali Leonard:** guy. If we do blow up the wall, we will get it from

**Tyram:** Yeah, we

**Ali Leonard:** both sides, like top and

**Christopher Hooper:** That's what she said.

**Tyram:** do need to try to find some way to keep you quiet if we can.

**Ali Leonard:** bottom.

**Justin Hale:** Uh

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Do you have a silent bomb?

**Justin Hale:** no. Do I have

**Tyram:** Or what if we make a noise

**Justin Hale:** silent

**Tyram:** simultaneously with a bomb going off so that it masks the noise of the

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** bomb? like make a noise like somewhere else,

**Ali Leonard:** I cough loud.

**Walden Briarhelm:** A

**Justin Hale:** bomb? Yeah. Like a rub.

**Tyram:** you

**Walden Briarhelm:** decoy

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, like a rubber chicken

**Walden Briarhelm:** noise.

**Ellis Taylor:** mean like a

**Justin Hale:** or

**Tyram:** know?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uhoh. I don't think a concert coming from the vault room

**Ali Leonard:** What?

**Walden Briarhelm:** is going to make a lot of sense. I don't know. How many explosives

**Ellis Taylor:** concert. I think

**Walden Briarhelm:** do you have on you, Brew? I know you carry a few. Maybe you

**Ellis Taylor:** so.

**Walden Briarhelm:** set a few of all over place

**Justin Hale:** A few. A few dozen. You mean I have this really cool

**Tyram:** Oh, hey, there's a Toyota

**Justin Hale:** rope stuff that explodes when you push the end of

**Tyram:** Tacoma down on the street there. No one would even pay attention. Like, would it would it be out of the ordinary for it to just blow up at random?

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, you know

**Justin Hale:** it. There's There's two people on this call that

**Christopher Hooper:** those those oriental vehicles really just

**Tyram:** They're known to

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** like fall apart. Hot.

**Justin Hale:** disagree.

**Tyram:** spontaneously explode. I'm establishing that in

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hey, that's why I only drive for at least the engines.

**Tyram:** canon. Oh, absolutely. I mean, I don't understand why the Toyota Tacoma even tries to compete with the Ford

**Walden Briarhelm:** Reliable.

**Justin Hale:** So anyways, I have this

**Tyram:** F-150.

**Justin Hale:** exploding rope that is sticky on one end. We can stick it around the wall and then when we blow it up, it pops this chunk

**Tyram:** We just still need to do something to

**Ali Leonard:** Can we time it to blow up with the

**Justin Hale:** out.

**Tyram:** like Yeah. If And

**Ali Leonard:** car? Can you do

**Tyram:** then they'll think like, "Oh, a car exploded outside, you

**Ali Leonard:** both? Yeah. Random teens.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, there's a Toyota parked down

**Justin Hale:** Or

**Tyram:** know?

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** or I can put I can put explosives in sewer, remote detonate those in the sewer, cause big big water problem, and then blow this up

**Tyram:** That could work, too. How are we going to get a

**Ali Leonard:** Would

**Justin Hale:** at the same time.

**Tyram:** Toyota Tacoma into the sewers,

**Ali Leonard:** it would it blow up the methane

**Walden Briarhelm:** there.

**Ali Leonard:** and then cause up a bigger explosion?

**Justin Hale:** No,

**Tyram:** though?

**Ali Leonard:** I don't know. I don't know. I think that'd be funny to make poop

**Justin Hale:** no, that's not

**Ali Leonard:** explode.

**Justin Hale:** that's Oh, then yes, of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, I always like the fact that our uh

**Ali Leonard:** You got to have poop

**Walden Briarhelm:** mission leader has a good sense of humor for poop exploding. Yeah, we had all the a-hole, b hole, and

**Justin Hale:** course.

**Walden Briarhelm:** cornhole jokes. Might as well get down to the the core of it. So, uh you need help

**Ali Leonard:** jokes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** setting up them explosives? What are we doing?

**Justin Hale:** All right, I'll just I'll just uh rub hell down there because that's

**Tyram:** Well, here you could borrow one of our spider

**Justin Hale:** a thing with the

**Tyram:** slippers and go back and just come back up real

**Justin Hale:** head. All right, that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** You're

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm going to walk up to the third the roof and have a

**Justin Hale:** fine. All

**Tyram:** You're

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm. Don't pass

**Christopher Hooper:** cigarette. All right. Uh let me know when it's over. All

**Tyram:** becoming uh Clementine more and more as this session goes

**Ali Leonard:** by.

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Justin Hale:** right, that's so

**Ali Leonard:** Don't pass by any

**Justin Hale:** true. Um, all right. So, I put on the slippers. I uh I walk down

**Tyram:** on.

**Justin Hale:** the uh the side of the building. I get down to the sewer. I put some remote detonate charge um uh

**Ali Leonard:** windows.

**Justin Hale:** C4. I kind of just like drop them down and then plant one on the side so that it explodes the uh uh what do you call it? The the circle piece on the road.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Manhole.o.

**Justin Hale:** What's that thing called? Manhole. Thank you. Uh so it'll pop the manhole off cartoonish. And

**Tyram:** Okay. All

**Justin Hale:** then walk back up. We're so light. He just walks up like

**Tyram:** right. That works.

**Christopher Hooper:** While you're gone, um, Alma

**Justin Hale:** horizontally. Um, all

**Christopher Hooper:** talks to their sander and says the

**Ali Leonard:** No one

**Christopher Hooper:** sand brute isn't a child.

**Ali Leonard:** knows.

**Christopher Hooper:** Why? Cuz like it's giving giving him alcohol is one thing, but he has

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, I I think it's okay. I think he's like a

**Christopher Hooper:** explosives.

**Ali Leonard:** teenager and I think it's like legal after the age of like 15. So, I think it's all fine. He's a No, he's

**Christopher Hooper:** 15. Like that's really young for a

**Ali Leonard:** not a dwarf. He's a goblin. That's why he's green.

**Christopher Hooper:** dwarf. Oh, what's a

**Ellis Taylor:** Peaches. He's um he's

**Ali Leonard:** I love that you don't see

**Ellis Taylor:** green or color

**Ali Leonard:** race. Yeah, he I mean he's

**Christopher Hooper:** goblin? I just thought he was sick.

**Ellis Taylor:** apparently.

**Justin Hale:** Um, it's called

**Ali Leonard:** probably sick a little bit with his like dietary habits. He hasn't pooped in a long

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. It made sense to

**Justin Hale:** species. Goblins only poop. I walk up as I as I overhear you

**Ali Leonard:** time.

**Justin Hale:** guys with my super high perception. Goblins only poop like once a week. is

**Tyram:** Guys, I'll take your word for it. But guys, this

**Justin Hale:** is fine. It's normal for

**Tyram:** is a conversation you can have tomorrow.

**Ali Leonard:** That's at the party. At the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, I'm so looking forward to my

**Christopher Hooper:** me.

**Ellis Taylor:** Can I

**Justin Hale:** goblins. Yeah. Save it for

**Tyram:** Tomorrow's going to be a busy

**Ellis Taylor:** get Can I get a small

**Tyram:** day. Sorry, you were saying some

**Ellis Taylor:** recap? Oh, sorry. Can I get a small recap? I had to deal with a melting down

**Tyram:** cream. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** party. Who

**Ellis Taylor:** toddler who didn't want his dad. I couldn't hear

**Justin Hale:** tomorrow.

**Ali Leonard:** does? Am I

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. We haven't really done that

**Justin Hale:** We

**Ali Leonard:** right? We're still We just zipline. We kind of That's

**Justin Hale:** haven't we

**Tyram:** Um

**Christopher Hooper:** much.

**Ellis Taylor:** anything. We just stayed on the

**Justin Hale:** basically we grapple hooked to the side of the

**Ellis Taylor:** roof.

**Justin Hale:** wall. Uh I planted remote charges in the sewer as a distraction and then we're going to blast our way into the sidewall

**Ali Leonard:** it. We didn't realize there weren't windows on the second

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** of this

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna I I did explicitly say that,

**Ali Leonard:** floor. So, we went to a

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool. He did say that and

**Justin Hale:** building.

**Tyram:** but

**Ali Leonard:** wall.

**Ellis Taylor:** I drew it as part of my little picture. So, well, I had been

**Tyram:** man, you were you would have been clutch a few minutes ago, I gotta say. But yeah. Okay. So the plan is they detonate the sewer bomb and the bomb on the side of the building so that if anyone hears the explosion, they'll be like, "Oh, it must have been that sewer bomb." You

**Ali Leonard:** You know,

**Ellis Taylor:** here. What do we know about the second floor of the building other than it's a vault? Like, is there

**Tyram:** know, we do know for sure that it's the vault, but we don't like you guys

**Ali Leonard:** classic

**Ellis Taylor:** anything else there? Are there probably going to be people

**Tyram:** don't have any intel on the interior of the

**Ali Leonard:** We'll be fine. We'll be

**Ellis Taylor:** there? Okay, we're on a

**Justin Hale:** It's fine. Nothing

**Tyram:** building.

**Ali Leonard:** fine. Let's f****** send

**Ellis Taylor:** time crunch anyway. Let's just f****** go for

**Justin Hale:** Nothing can go wrong. Nothing can go

**Christopher Hooper:** Peaches, why you looking at me like

**Ellis Taylor:** it. Like, f****** go big or go home, guys. Let's

**Justin Hale:** wrong. Yeah,

**Tyram:** They're Sander. Don't imitate

**Ellis Taylor:** go.

**Tyram:** Alma's vernacular.

**Ali Leonard:** it. I learned it from

**Christopher Hooper:** that?

**Justin Hale:** dude.

**Ali Leonard:** her. She taught me it.

**Justin Hale:** It's probably not good to learn anything from her. Are

**Tyram:** That's Let's do

**Justin Hale:** we ready? I got to push the button

**Tyram:** it.

**Justin Hale:** on this rope. Who wants to push this big red scary button

**Ali Leonard:** I feel like it's

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, me. I'd love

**Justin Hale:** for the sewer

**Tyram:** Here, let me push it. Everyone else can have plenty of opportunities in the future to

**Justin Hale:** bombs? All

**Tyram:** push the big red

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Jesus

**Christopher Hooper:** to. Yeah. When pilot or when

**Ellis Taylor:** Peaches.

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** Bramble is gone. I can't believe you're talking about leaving

**Ali Leonard:** Christ.

**Christopher Hooper:** us.

**Tyram:** button. Yeah, I could be moving on any day now. I won't have

**Ali Leonard:** That's what I

**Justin Hale:** All

**Tyram:** too many opportunities to push Brew's red button in the future. unlike the rest

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. All right,

**Tyram:** of you. All

**Christopher Hooper:** Brent. All right, Bartle. Come on.

**Tyram:** right. And

**Christopher Hooper:** Whatever.

**Justin Hale:** right, I pushed the

**Tyram:** and uh yeah, um a bunch of people from a lot of the town houses around here poke their heads out the

**Ali Leonard:** said.

**Tyram:** window to see this uh manhole cover just spewing out uh sewage. Um and like everyone down the street is like,

**Justin Hale:** rope.

**Tyram:** "Ew." But yeah, no one really notices the other explosion going on at the same time. So yeah, well

**Ali Leonard:** That's

**Tyram:** done. All right, so you guys are able to zipline and, you know, have a fun old time ziplining all the way across into the

**Ali Leonard:** good.


### [01:20:00]

**Tyram:** uh into the uh exploded uh side of the building. And you guys find yourself in a um a large square room with what kind of looks like another square going all the way around the room inside of this larger square. Like you can think of this as like there's a big square hallway around a square shaped room in front of you that basically takes up this whole floor. Um there's one door on this interior room. Um it's a large circular door um made up of concentric circles going outwards. There is a um knob in the middle and each of the concentric circles has a crystal on it. Um alternating red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, red. So total of

**Christopher Hooper:** on each

**Tyram:** seven. Yeah. down each

**Christopher Hooper:** circle. And so like the inner circle is like really

**Ellis Taylor:** So, seven colored crystals on each circle.

**Tyram:** circle. And the inner circle doesn't have a crystal on it. It just has like

**Christopher Hooper:** tiny.

**Ellis Taylor:** Sorry, you broke up a little

**Tyram:** uh what looks like to be like just like a a knob like that you can turn in the middle. Um I'm going to say that the specialist thief Peaches uh cast detect magic on the door and

**Ellis Taylor:** bit.

**Tyram:** notices that it does magical lock on it or cream rather.

**Ali Leonard:** Hell yeah.

**Tyram:** Sorry.

**Ellis Taylor:** No. Well, no. Peaches

**Tyram:** Oh yeah, sure. That's fine.

**Ellis Taylor:** has detect magic. If it's me, if it's if it's

**Tyram:** Yeah. Hey, I mean sure that's

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia, if it's Olivia. Yeah. I

**Tyram:** fine with

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey, Peaches, allow me. I'll

**Ellis Taylor:** also have dispel

**Christopher Hooper:** do it. And I'll cast detect

**Ellis Taylor:** magic. I

**Tyram:** me. All right. You sense that there is magic on the

**Christopher Hooper:** magic.

**Ellis Taylor:** know.

**Tyram:** door. Um you also get that it is aggeration magic of some sort.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh my goodness. There's aation magic on this

**Ali Leonard:** You're so smart.

**Christopher Hooper:** door. It's

**Tyram:** In fact, you can kind of detect magic interwoven through the interior walls here throughout. Um, it looks as though um this aggeration magic is like woven into the uh the very woodwork throughout this vault

**Christopher Hooper:** nothing.

**Tyram:** room. Um, that's fine, I guess, for the purposes here. But like I was picturing like a ring, like a bunch of concentric

**Christopher Hooper:** It's like an amphitheater or something. You know

**Tyram:** rings. Yeah, we'll be kind of like looking at a circular

**Christopher Hooper:** what I'm

**Tyram:** amphitheater from above,

**Christopher Hooper:** saying? Like I said, this building built by Plato, one of the geeks.

**Tyram:** man. Damn it. I hate having to contend with the nerds.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. So, there's like a there's like magic

**Ellis Taylor:** Thanks.

**Christopher Hooper:** weave like going all through us, all throughout this room. It's like kind of crazy. So, I'm a little worried if we looks like a puzzle. So like let's be

**Ali Leonard:** Let's be careful,

**Christopher Hooper:** careful

**Justin Hale:** You know the the best way to solve a

**Ali Leonard:** guys. You've gotten to blow something

**Justin Hale:** puzzle. And I hold up two

**Ali Leonard:** up. Let's let somebody else do

**Justin Hale:** explosives. This this door looks like

**Ali Leonard:** something.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I don't usually do

**Justin Hale:** the perfect door to blow up. All right.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, if we fail, you're definitely getting

**Walden Briarhelm:** this. I gotta say

**Ellis Taylor:** Taylor.

**Justin Hale:** Whatever. Call me when you need

**Ali Leonard:** called. Let's be

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. And brew is one for

**Ellis Taylor:** No.

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Tyram:** Um, did you say my name a second

**Walden Briarhelm:** one.

**Ellis Taylor:** I did. I was wait I was just going to put in the chat. Would identify tell us

**Tyram:** ago?

**Ali Leonard:** fair.

**Ellis Taylor:** anything more about it or is it

**Tyram:** Um, identify I think is you're supposed to be identify

**Ellis Taylor:** kind of just tell us the

**Tyram:** magic items. But if you want to burn a spell slot on that, then yes, I'll say that you can learn stuff about

**Walden Briarhelm:** Is there anything a history check would gain?

**Ellis Taylor:** same. Sure. and

**Tyram:** this. Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** uses

**Tyram:** Um, Peaches, you learned that um the magic on this door, it probably if it's not opened the

**Ellis Taylor:** identify.

**Tyram:** correct way, it will sound an alarm. So like if Brew used his bombs for example, it would probably set off a huge

**Ellis Taylor:** He's going to put his you know

**Walden Briarhelm:** This

**Ellis Taylor:** Brew I'm assuming is holding his bomb. He's going to put his hand on and be

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, This

**Ellis Taylor:** like Kar's going to be like yeah I If hear we you do bud. anything, Yeah. if we don't do this Yeah. correct, it's gonna set off alarm. And there's just like a lot of

**Tyram:** alarm.

**Ellis Taylor:** fighting we're gonna have. And I'm

**Tyram:** You kind of cut out on us a little

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm really

**Ellis Taylor:** like a shoot. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** the

**Christopher Hooper:** glad closed captioning is isn't showing me

**Ellis Taylor:** moved. I'm going to

**Christopher Hooper:** that Elma's going to

**Ellis Taylor:** move.

**Tyram:** bit. As

**Christopher Hooper:** start trying to move the circles to align the

**Tyram:** soon as you Which which crystal do you touch first?

**Christopher Hooper:** colors. And while she does

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, when you touch one of

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, the blue

**Tyram:** the blue crystals, it changes color to

**Christopher Hooper:** one. Oh Beautiful. my goodness. And she's going to go around and touch more of the the colors

**Tyram:** indigo. When you touch one of the red

**Christopher Hooper:** and the one next to

**Tyram:** ones, it turns

**Christopher Hooper:** it. Okay. And then the next one after

**Tyram:** orange. That's another blue one, and it turns indigo.

**Christopher Hooper:** that. Oh my goodness. Okay. Um, so there's uh 1 2 3 4 5 six seven of us in the seven of these crystals. Let's all touch one and see what happens.

**Tyram:** Okay. Um, you

**Christopher Hooper:** goodness. Oh, I got to press the button. And I press the

**Tyram:** button doesn't have any immediate effect that you can

**Christopher Hooper:** button.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm

**Justin Hale:** button.

**Christopher Hooper:** stupid button.

**Justin Hale:** Maybe, maybe press it again. Maybe it didn't

**Tyram:** It doesn't seemingly do anything. You

**Walden Briarhelm:** Do we hear anything Weapon.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And I press

**Tyram:** can feel I guess you can hear like a bit of a mechanical wor but but you can't really see anything going on with this

**Justin Hale:** work. Nothing's

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm expecting a giant boulder start coming down that

**Christopher Hooper:** again.

**Ellis Taylor:** curve of the hallway. Just saying.

**Tyram:** button. I'm having to rewrite this on the

**Ellis Taylor:** There's so many spells Lyanna

**Justin Hale:** broken.

**Tyram:** fly.

**Ellis Taylor:** has.

**Tyram:** Wow. Okay. So, what would you guys like to do? Oh, sorry. I guess I should say that there's like that the detect magic thing

**Walden Briarhelm:** I would

**Tyram:** about like blowing up wall sets off an alarm. That's ubiquitous. Like

**Walden Briarhelm:** imagine

**Tyram:** every bit of this vault has that going

**Walden Briarhelm:** I uh I'd like to think

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** on.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Spoons kind of walks around the curve looking at like you can see him kind of like imagining how he'd handle the corner. But does he perceive

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** Spoon strikes me as the kind of guy who does like kung fu in the

**Walden Briarhelm:** does he perceive

**Tyram:** mirror. is

**Walden Briarhelm:** anything? Oh yeah. Yeah. And records it. Uh, so has has the mechanical sounds continued or was it just for a

**Tyram:** like um it was just for like a moment like it sounded like like a clicking noise went off every time you like hold the button down. But yeah, if you round a curve, you don't

**Walden Briarhelm:** moment? I think uh I think Spoons

**Tyram:** see anything in the hallway, but you do see a button on the

**Walden Briarhelm:** is

**Tyram:** end of this hallway. So like this the hallway basically forms like one big Lshape. Um, and the other end there's another dead end, but this one appears to have a a button at the end of

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm going to yell back. You guys,

**Tyram:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** there's another

**Christopher Hooper:** Press the

**Walden Briarhelm:** button. You You want to press it the same

**Tyram:** As you

**Walden Briarhelm:** time? Wait, wait. on

**Christopher Hooper:** button. Oh yeah, sure. on three and then

**Tyram:** walk down the hallway towards the button, um you step on a

**Walden Briarhelm:** on three or after

**Tyram:** uh a pressure plate and um you need to give me a deck

**Christopher Hooper:** go.

**Walden Briarhelm:** three. Oh, great. I'm always so good at these stories

**Tyram:** safe. You managed to do a really

**Walden Briarhelm:** with net 20 with a plus five

**Tyram:** sick dodge as uh more darts shoot out of the walls. All right. So, yeah, you make it to the end of

**Walden Briarhelm:** 25. This ain't my first

**Tyram:** the hall. No

**Walden Briarhelm:** rodeo. So, uh, I avoided some dots. You should learn from me, Arma. Now, do we push the

**Tyram:** problem.

**Walden Briarhelm:** button on three or after three? Like one, two, three, go. That really revs my engine when I hear it said like that. Poper is on screen with his computer

**Tyram:** Damn

**Walden Briarhelm:** died. I think he took some more dots to the face, guys. Hey,

**Justin Hale:** Listen. Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Peaches, you over there? All right, Peaches. I'm going to count to

**Tyram:** him.

**Walden Briarhelm:** three. When I say three, you hit the button. One, two,

**Ellis Taylor:** Peaches.

**Walden Briarhelm:** three. Peaches and I hopefully

**Tyram:** Um, when you guys press

**Walden Briarhelm:** coordinate.

**Ellis Taylor:** Peaches.

**Tyram:** the buttons, uh, you guys both hear clicking noises, but neither of you notices anything happening. The door does not

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hey, uh, somebody try the

**Ellis Taylor:** Peaches tries the door. Yeah. Peaches

**Tyram:** open.

**Walden Briarhelm:** door. What if we press the buttons at the same time and

**Ellis Taylor:** tries

**Walden Briarhelm:** then open the

**Ellis Taylor:** peaches while we're pushing the

**Justin Hale:** always the

**Walden Briarhelm:** door? Yeah. Like it's like how to unlock the door. Maybe

**Ellis Taylor:** pushing buttons to try and open that

**Tyram:** next to that door and otherwise it seems identical but mirrored to

**Ellis Taylor:** door.

**Tyram:** the hallway you guys were just

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm just loving the idea

**Ellis Taylor:** I don't remember I don't remember leaving the other hallway. I

**Tyram:** in.

**Ellis Taylor:** thought Peaches and Cream were swapping cuz Peaches was going to like try the door while they were

**Tyram:** Okay. If you do that, then yes, the

**Ellis Taylor:** all pushing

**Tyram:** door just opens. Okay. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** buttons. Yeah, that's that's what I was trying to do. I was

**Tyram:** Um the interior if you you said

**Ellis Taylor:** like, when did I teleport to another hallway? I'm so confused.

**Tyram:** you went over to the right door. So yes. Um the button that Spoons is pressing unlocks the door in the other hallway. So, that door is just unlocked as long as Spoons

**Christopher Hooper:** And Alma's button is really

**Tyram:** is pressing that button.

**Christopher Hooper:** important.

**Tyram:** Disarms the traps. Yeah. In the uh the other hallway, each one of these hallways has a button that opens the door and disarms

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, gotcha.

**Tyram:** the traps in the other hallway. So, yeah. Um, I think Silas is going to go catch up with Peaches and Cream and uh go into this uh this next layer within the vaults here. All right. Um, so Alma and

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Mind talk. All right, everyone. I think we figured it

**Tyram:** um Alma and Spoons, uh, what are you guys

**Ellis Taylor:** out.

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, we're going to say, "Oh my god, I need y'all to in the other hallway open it for

**Tyram:** doing?

**Christopher Hooper:** us so we can get through, too." Right. Cuz

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm gonna I'm gonna stay by my button.

**Christopher Hooper:** each hallway makes it safe for the other hallway, right? So once they're through, no one is available to to uh open it

**Tyram:** Correct. That seems to be the case.

**Christopher Hooper:** then. All right. Well, um you know, don't worry about us. We'll be all here, I guess.

**Tyram:** Yeah. All right. Um, so what are Brew and Tander

**Justin Hale:** So, is it We're basically going to get down to one person

**Tyram:** doing? Hard to

**Justin Hale:** at the

**Walden Briarhelm:** All right, over here.

**Justin Hale:** end. All right.

**Christopher Hooper:** They're saying that you're

**Ali Leonard:** Can't we go through with peaches and

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Christopher Hooper:** muted.

**Ali Leonard:** cream? If they say like, "Hey, we got this door open." And

**Tyram:** say. Yeah, you can easily do that. Okay. So, it sounds like

**Ali Leonard:** bro and I would go with

**Tyram:** Dander, uh, Bartleby, uh, uh, not Damn it. Bartleby Brew, and, um, Peaches and Cream are all past that layer of hallways.

**Ali Leonard:** them.

**Justin Hale:** uh

**Tyram:** Okay, there's another door. You guys can see it on the map there on like the north side. Um this door has

**Justin Hale:** Okay.


### [01:50:00]

**Tyram:** um so yeah, inside of this hallway on the north side, um there's a lot of like tacky decorations all over the uh the wall of here. There's some sun dials, there's some hourglasses, and there's uh three different clock faces. Written on the door, you see the following inscription. I'm putting it in the

**Ali Leonard:** Set up

**Tyram:** Discord.

**Ali Leonard:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** Andy, can you describe the puzzle for me? Like while

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** you're in there, cuz I'd love

**Ali Leonard:** You would have loved

**Christopher Hooper:** puzzles. Oh

**Ali Leonard:** this. The decor is just right up your

**Christopher Hooper:** my gosh. Gothic.

**Ali Leonard:** alley. I'm so sad. It's got

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh my god, I love clocks and

**Ali Leonard:** clocks. It's got

**Christopher Hooper:** gears. You know I

**Tyram:** Yeah. The door itself has the the

**Ali Leonard:** gears. I know. That's your entire

**Tyram:** following inscription on

**Ali Leonard:** apartment. And then there's the door that

**Tyram:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** has an inscription that says 12, but it's par out. We really got

**Justin Hale:** Oh, that's what that

**Christopher Hooper:** do

**Ali Leonard:** to get you hooked on

**Justin Hale:** says. It's just a bunch of letters. It

**Tyram:** Brew

**Ali Leonard:** phonics. Letters com combine to form

**Justin Hale:** doesn't mean

**Tyram:** letters entire purpose is to convey

**Justin Hale:** anything. Who is

**Tyram:** meaning. f*** you,

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, it

**Tyram:** Brew.

**Ali Leonard:** words.

**Justin Hale:** this? But this one doesn't make any sense. There's like there's like dots in the middle of the

**Ali Leonard:** I think that's like time though, right? Don't you do that with

**Justin Hale:** of the

**Christopher Hooper:** says Oh, yeah. You're totally right. time like

**Justin Hale:** letters. Clocks

**Christopher Hooper:** a week

**Justin Hale:** don't have letters. They have numbers. It make no

**Christopher Hooper:** epoch. Why does it say 12

**Ali Leonard:** time? I'm going to ground you if you don't stop

**Justin Hale:** sense. I'm closer to the ground

**Christopher Hooper:** though? What does 12 mean? Is anything else on

**Ali Leonard:** that. You're going to get no

**Justin Hale:** than you

**Ali Leonard:** music. I'm going to take away your your compact discs and

**Justin Hale:** are.

**Ali Leonard:** your your music phones and your speaking

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** rocks. When we get home, I'm going to take

**Justin Hale:** You can't take away my speaking

**Christopher Hooper:** here?

**Tyram:** You're Not my real

**Ali Leonard:** away your speaking rocks when we get home. Mister, I'm going to take You know what? I'm going to take away your

**Justin Hale:** ruts. You

**Ali Leonard:** bombs. You act right. You straighten

**Justin Hale:** better. You You better not. You You

**Ali Leonard:** up. Your grounding will start tomorrow if you don't act

**Justin Hale:** wouldn't dare. You wouldn't

**Tyram:** dad.

**Ali Leonard:** right. Watch

**Justin Hale:** dare. What? What do the

**Ali Leonard:** me. Well, that's what we're trying to

**Justin Hale:** letters with the dots

**Ali Leonard:** figure

**Justin Hale:** mean? Well, you're so smart. The bands figured that

**Ellis Taylor:** How many

**Justin Hale:** out.

**Tyram:** There's um five different

**Ali Leonard:** out.

**Ellis Taylor:** clocks sundials are on the

**Tyram:** sun dials. There's um four

**Ellis Taylor:** wall?

**Justin Hale:** three.

**Tyram:** different uh hourglasses. And there's three clocks.

**Ellis Taylor:** How many hourglasses again? Sorry, I didn't

**Justin Hale:** Oh.

**Ellis Taylor:** write four. Okay. Well, my first

**Ali Leonard:** H. It's too

**Ellis Taylor:** solution doesn't work. That's too

**Christopher Hooper:** or a sun dial only works for 12 hours, right? And

**Ali Leonard:** many. Yeah. Me, too. Does

**Ellis Taylor:** many. Yeah. I mean, all

**Christopher Hooper:** depending on the solstice

**Tyram:** or

**Ellis Taylor:** of them. I

**Justin Hale:** Are these things in a

**Ellis Taylor:** mean,

**Justin Hale:** specific position in the

**Ali Leonard:** it

**Tyram:** Um, not really. They're just kind of like randomly scattered across the the north wall

**Christopher Hooper:** This. So there's um

**Justin Hale:** room?

**Christopher Hooper:** there's like 12 artifacts. Five sund dials, four

**Tyram:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** hourglasses, and three clocks. So, there's 12 of those

**Ali Leonard:** Well, you're right.

**Christopher Hooper:** things. Four

**Ali Leonard:** It's too

**Christopher Hooper:** hourglasses. How what are the hourglasses increments? Are they like a minute hourglass or like an hour?

**Tyram:** Um, give me a um I guess either I'll take perception, investigation,

**Christopher Hooper:** No, Bon, you need to tell me I'm not in the room with

**Tyram:** or insight for

**Ali Leonard:** much. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** you. Thank you,

**Ali Leonard:** I'm I'm looking for you, girl. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. I'm gonna squint. I'm going

**Christopher Hooper:** Anda. Yeah,

**Tyram:** that.

**Ali Leonard:** to squint real hard. You know how that helps.

**Christopher Hooper:** use your

**Tyram:** You couldn't tell at first, but then you squint

**Christopher Hooper:** goggles.

**Tyram:** extra hard. Um, and it looks like the hourglasses, some of them are set

**Ali Leonard:** 19.

**Tyram:** for a minute, some of them are set for an hour, some of them are set for different increments of time. It looks like they're you see with the minute ones, they seem like they automatically

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** like flip over when they're done. Um, with that same investigation, um, you also see that, uh, the sun dials each have like a different spotlight shining on them. And each of the clocks has, uh, 24, it's set to military time. The clocks are there's 24 uh, numbers on them. And then there's also the letters uh, Y and Z like kind of a fitting fit in

**Ali Leonard:** Wow.

**Tyram:** after the uh, the 24 and the one.

**Christopher Hooper:** What?

**Ali Leonard:** What? What are the sund dials? What are the lights on for the sun

**Tyram:** It looks like they just have like they actually have like drift globes which is a D and D magic item that just like basically emits light and like they're kind of just like orbiting around the sund

**Ali Leonard:** dials?

**Tyram:** dials.

**Justin Hale:** So, Can we manipulate any of those things to

**Tyram:** The the clock

**Justin Hale:** like change the sun dials, the hourglasses, the

**Tyram:** faces do not have any covers on

**Justin Hale:** clocks?

**Ali Leonard:** And they basically are letters because it's 24 hours plus Y and Z, but there's only five blocks.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. And it's just a Y and a

**Tyram:** them. There's three clocks.

**Ali Leonard:** There's 24 numbers. There's three clocks, but there's two

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I already wrote

**Justin Hale:** Z.

**Ali Leonard:** hands per clock. All

**Tyram:** That's Wther Sanders team

**Ali Leonard:** right. So, so then we set

**Tyram:** leader.

**Ali Leonard:** them to like the numbers that equate to the letter to the T and then the

**Tyram:** Okay. All right. As soon

**Ali Leonard:** W and then the E

**Ellis Taylor:** down. Yeah, I wrote those down already,

**Justin Hale:** Uh we have one we have one

**Tyram:** as you do that, you hear a clicking sound on the

**Ali Leonard:** l.

**Ellis Taylor:** but

**Christopher Hooper:** What's

**Tyram:** door.

**Justin Hale:** number. Perfect.

**Christopher Hooper:** happening,

**Ali Leonard:** We did it. With your help, we got through the

**Christopher Hooper:** Anda? Oh my gosh, there's a letter thing with the

**Ali Leonard:** clocks. There's the letter thing with the

**Christopher Hooper:** numbers. Oh my goodness. Just like you was saying,

**Ali Leonard:** numbers. Exactly what you were saying.

**Tyram:** You know,

**Ali Leonard:** Oh my gosh. This is why we do puzzles at

**Tyram:** no, but for uh playing a wizard, this is a very high

**Ali Leonard:** home.

**Tyram:** intelligence uh party we got going on

**Christopher Hooper:** Anda, perfect for your puzzles.

**Tyram:** here. Intelligence is by far the least like primary stat for all the different classes, but we have three representatives for the enemy class. All right. So, yeah. Um, you guys uh managed to open this third this final layer of doors. Inside uh you see there are a bunch of safes, a bunch of

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** uh like drawers built into the walls and at the very center of the room there is a uh very ornately carved

**Christopher Hooper:** our um

**Tyram:** box. It's made of the finest mahogany. There is a uh dragon stencileled onto the top of the box and um polished to a very impressive sheen. And

**Christopher Hooper:** sorry

**Tyram:** you get the most foroding feeling that inside of this box contains a terrible secret that shall be unleashed upon the world as soon as it is

**Ali Leonard:** Great. Let's grab the

**Ellis Taylor:** So, f*** that

**Justin Hale:** So we want to we want to open that

**Tyram:** opened. The box is uh kind of like nailed onto the pedestal

**Ali Leonard:** box. Oh, no. We have

**Ellis Taylor:** box.

**Justin Hale:** box, right?

**Tyram:** that it's on. All

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Okay. Let's grab this box and get out, right,

**Ellis Taylor:** I uh All right, Peach is

**Tyram:** right. It Well, as soon as you guys

**Ali Leonard:** guys?

**Ellis Taylor:** just gonna rip it up now.

**Tyram:** actually go into the room, you guys hear uh who has the highest uh passive? Probably Brew, right? Passive perception. Okay, Brew, you actually hear a crashing noise coming from downstairs and a lot of yelling. Suddenly, simultaneously, an alarm starts sounding throughout the

**Ali Leonard:** Brilliant.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, you guys, we uh I think

**Tyram:** building. The hell we

**Walden Briarhelm:** you guys triggered something.

**Christopher Hooper:** What's going on in

**Tyram:** did. Do you guys hear the sounds

**Christopher Hooper:** there?

**Tyram:** of fighting coming from

**Justin Hale:** Uh,

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh my god. Are y'all fighting downstairs?

**Tyram:** downstairs?

**Ali Leonard:** Someone else has come in.

**Ellis Taylor:** someone

**Ali Leonard:** Alma, okay, let's evacuate. Let's get our things and

**Ellis Taylor:** else. I was wondering why it was a different

**Justin Hale:** uh,

**Tyram:** Okay. So, um Silas is going to uh start going up to the box and he sees that it's a puzzle box and with

**Ali Leonard:** go.

**Tyram:** his uh deaf skills and hands and everything like that, he begins work

**Ellis Taylor:** gang.

**Tyram:** of opening this box. Um what would the rest of you guys like to

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, our spoons and I still stuck

**Tyram:** do? At the moment, you're still outside.

**Ellis Taylor:** Can we get them

**Tyram:** Yes. I'll say that once you guys were inside of that

**Ellis Taylor:** inside? By the

**Tyram:** like uh hallway, you see that there is a button that just lets you open the door from the

**Ellis Taylor:** way,

**Tyram:** inside. Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** yeah, we'll just come let them in.


### [02:00:00]

**Justin Hale:** Cool. Okay. While while uh Bardby is working on

**Christopher Hooper:** outside.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, can we just put the

**Justin Hale:** the box, go

**Tyram:** Yeah. actually yes is a

**Ellis Taylor:** hole in front of the door so when they open the door they fall in the

**Tyram:** thing you're allowed to do. That's one of the re That's one of the good uses

**Justin Hale:** ahead.

**Tyram:** of a portable hole is you can slide it underneath doors and do it that

**Justin Hale:** Nice. I am going to proactively place charges uh on what looks like structural areas of each one

**Ellis Taylor:** hole?

**Justin Hale:** of these openings. So, I'm just going to like work my way out of all of this labyrinthine mess and place

**Tyram:** way.

**Justin Hale:** remote charges on the same

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hey, Alma. I think you should join the rest of the crew.

**Justin Hale:** button.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm going to go back and get the car ready. I think we're going to have to scram

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, Spoons. I'm worried about you. Are you going to be okay by yourself? Remember, we got your party

**Walden Briarhelm:** soon. Oh yeah, I got this. Oh yeah. And we are going to party.

**Christopher Hooper:** tomorrow. All right. All right.

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I see you in the

**Christopher Hooper:** We'll be out. We'll be out soon. Okay.

**Tyram:** Okay. While uh Silus is

**Walden Briarhelm:** car. Oh,

**Tyram:** fiddling around with the puzzle box, let's switch perspective over to Spoons real quick. Um, where are you going?

**Walden Briarhelm:** yeah. Uh, so, um, if I understand correctly, I've drawn up a separate diagram. I should be able to get out of

**Tyram:** Spoons, you can get out. No problem.

**Walden Briarhelm:** this and make it back to the upper part. I'm gonna make it,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** um, back to the zip line and do like the the zip to the other side if I can. and then uh just jump down basically.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Okay. I'm going to

**Walden Briarhelm:** I won't take fall damage and then get the

**Tyram:** say you guys were on the roof of the other building,

**Walden Briarhelm:** car.

**Tyram:** correct? So, the zip line would be slanting upwards. I don't think you can take a knife

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm. Okay. I do not have enough strength to fight physics. You are

**Ellis Taylor:** He can at least he can at least

**Tyram:** across. Yeah. And you could like

**Walden Briarhelm:** right. Uh I I could just jump

**Ellis Taylor:** get to the middle though,

**Tyram:** military like crawl up the rope, but you won't be able to zip line up the

**Walden Briarhelm:** down.

**Ellis Taylor:** right?

**Tyram:** rope. Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Um, where's the thingy at?

**Ellis Taylor:** Wrong.

**Tyram:** but hey, as soon as you get to that opening in the uh the wall, you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh,

**Tyram:** see that apparently the front door has been kicked in of the Pandora gang's uh base here. Um you can hear the sounds of fighting and um you actually also hear um let me check to see how this would work. Um okay. Um, you also hear the sound of footsteps coming from the third floor down into the floor that you guys are on. And I'm going to roll to see if any of them, they don't necessarily have to go by where you guys have opened the door and uh blown open a hole in the wall. So, I'm going to roll to see if they go uh one of two ways. Uh, somebody want to call odds or evens? All right, I rolled

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey, we get a hope

**Tyram:** even.

**Justin Hale:** I don't know if that's good or

**Tyram:** It means that they at least some of them

**Walden Briarhelm:** We get a hope

**Justin Hale:** bad.

**Tyram:** walked by where the hole in the wall were like, "What the hell?" And yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** die.

**Tyram:** the uh the the tough guys from the Pandora gang have seen that uh you guys have uh gone into the

**Christopher Hooper:** die.

**Tyram:** vault. Um some of them head on down to uh deal with whatever's going down on the first floor, but some of them start making their way into the vault. Um, actually spoons, you have an opportunity. You hear them coming. What would you like to do? Would you like to continue your way to the car or would you like to do anything about the people

**Walden Briarhelm:** First thing I'm able to message still and say, "Uhoh, we got trouble, guys. The Pandora group uh and they're they're moving. They they got people going down to the first floor. They got people headed to

**Tyram:** approaching?

**Walden Briarhelm:** the vault

**Tyram:** Okay. And after you pass along the message, what would you like to

**Walden Briarhelm:** now. Do I I can just hear

**Tyram:** do? Um, okay. I'm going to

**Walden Briarhelm:** several footsteps. I don't have like a body count of people that are coming down

**Tyram:** roll a d4 and that's how many are going to go towards the vault and the rest are going to go downstairs. One particularly brave person, um, I'm going

**Walden Briarhelm:** the I

**Tyram:** to say Pandora herself, uh, is going to be like, "No

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh

**Justin Hale:** Thanks.

**Tyram:** one steals from me. go deal with whatever's going on downstairs. And

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Tyram:** uh yeah, she's going to make her way into the

**Walden Briarhelm:** is there. Go

**Justin Hale:** Uh, I'm I'm going to preemptively set up my cannon right behind the

**Tyram:** vaults. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** ahead. Okay, you guys. I think Pandora herself is coming. Can you guys handle this or you want me to take

**Justin Hale:** cornhole.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh no, Spoons, don't take her by yourself.

**Walden Briarhelm:** her?

**Christopher Hooper:** She's too

**Ali Leonard:** No, I'll take care of Pandora. We got it. You go

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Are you

**Ali Leonard:** on. Go with the escape

**Walden Briarhelm:** sure? I'll meet you. All right. I'll meet you in the

**Tyram:** right, glasses

**Ali Leonard:** plan and

**Walden Briarhelm:** car. I'll have it

**Tyram:** on. Wheelman mode engaged. All right.

**Ali Leonard:** then

**Christopher Hooper:** dangerous.

**Tyram:** Um Okay. So, you head down. Yeah. You're a monk. You can slowf fall. It's not a big deal. You can get down. No problem. Yep. Um so,

**Walden Briarhelm:** running.

**Tyram:** yeah, you make your way over to the car. Okay. So, um you guys hear fighting going on downstairs, especially now that like the upper members of the gang have like made their way down. Um but Pandora makes her way towards the interior room here.

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice.

**Tyram:** Um, but as soon as she gets within range of Brew's uh cannon, yeah, I'll say that you had a chance to take a pot shot at her. All right, uh, roll the hit with

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Uh crap. Ah, where is the cannon? There it

**Ali Leonard:** for

**Walden Briarhelm:** It's pretty quiet up there, you guys. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** is.

**Tyram:** it.

**Justin Hale:** plus eight. That's going to be a

**Tyram:** Yeah, that

**Justin Hale:** 23 to hit. All

**Ali Leonard:** now.

**Justin Hale:** right. It's going to do 3d8 plus. So, it does 15 damage and

**Tyram:** is

**Justin Hale:** pushes her five feet back.

**Tyram:** She gets hit right in the chest and gets knocked backwards. And at this point, I'm going to say, uh, people in the vault, go ahead and roll initiative. Um, Silus is not going to take part in this fight because he's going to be busy working on the, uh, on the

**Justin Hale:** How

**Tyram:** box. Well, uh, Silas sort of plotwise has to be the one who ends up with this orb. So,

**Justin Hale:** convenient. How convenient. It's like this was already planned or

**Tyram:** yes. I don't know. That's just strange how that works. Um, holy s***. Okay. Yeah. Um, can everybody put their initiative in the chat here,

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm working on

**Justin Hale:** something. Chat always

**Tyram:** please? All right. So, we got a

**Ellis Taylor:** it. Oh,

**Justin Hale:** runs away from

**Tyram:** butt at an

**Ellis Taylor:** wow.

**Tyram:** 18. All right.

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Tyram:** Oh, I like how you turned yourself black and white. That's really cool. You're kind out of the scene. That's really cool. All right. Um, and how about Cream? Never mind. Okay. Okay. Uh, Pandora is going first. Um, she like snarls at you after getting hit square in the chest. She is now going to uh run into the room and

**Ellis Taylor:** But there's a

**Tyram:** um well, okay, that's fair. She'll have to probably try she'll

**Ellis Taylor:** hole.

**Tyram:** try to jump over it with her acrobatics. Um yeah, she's able to kind of do like a somersault over the over the portable hole and uh make her way uh over to the inside of the room. Um she's going to come after Oh, sorry that I probably should have asked this before. Sorry, but like how are you guys situated

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** inside this

**Justin Hale:** I'd assume all of us like in front well from her perspective like gathered in front of Bartleby as if we were watching him before and now we've all just like turned

**Tyram:** room? That makes sense to me.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Shoot.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm missing stuff. I'll be right

**Tyram:** Okay. Well, um I guess it makes the most sense for Peaches to be like kind of the in the protective position here. They are the group

**Ellis Taylor:** back.

**Justin Hale:** around

**Tyram:** muscle. All right. So, um they'll the Pandora will go and try to get uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Peaches real quick. Um all right, first attack. Uh, does a 20 hit?

**Ellis Taylor:** Hey

**Tyram:** Okay, then that does hit.

**Ellis Taylor:** guys.

**Tyram:** Um, okay. So, you take Sorry, I need to I need to get on a dice roller for this

**Justin Hale:** Are we using our current

**Tyram:** one just for simplicity sake. Yes, let's just do

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** stats. Okay, I I'm going to forgo using the feats that I

**Tyram:** that. That makes sense

**Justin Hale:** got earlier because they like tied in thematically to what we did

**Tyram:** to me. So, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** before.

**Tyram:** Um, okay. Um, Peaches, you take 37 damage. Most of

**Ellis Taylor:** Jesus

**Tyram:** it is poison damage as uh she stabs you with a short

**Justin Hale:** Okay. What the

**Tyram:** sword. A short sword uh coated in

**Ellis Taylor:** f***. Well,

**Tyram:** poison.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm not a dwarf, so what do I had to have works to have anything? I have to

**Tyram:** Yeah. Good s***. Yeah.


### [02:10:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** look it up. Ah, damn it.

**Tyram:** Um they'll then um whip out a crossbow and aim it at um I'll just roll to see who they target here. Um all of you guys seem basically the same to me. Um

**Justin Hale:** hell?

**Tyram:** okay. So they're going to try to shoot at uh at their sander. That hits.

**Ellis Taylor:** Bring

**Tyram:** Um I'm I'm assuming your AC is not 24, right? Okay. Uh oh

**Ali Leonard:** Good. It is

**Ellis Taylor:** it.

**Tyram:** goodness. Um, all right.

**Ali Leonard:** not

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm missing stuff. Oh,

**Tyram:** Um, you take 30 damage as they hit you with a poisoncoated

**Ellis Taylor:** wait.

**Tyram:** uh, crossbow bolt.

**Ali Leonard:** even if cuz I'm a

**Tyram:** Dwarf means you get advantage on saving throws for poison. And this

**Ali Leonard:** dwarf.

**Tyram:** did not factor into it doesn't do anything for poison damage,

**Ali Leonard:** Second ghost. Okay.

**Tyram:** which that can be frustrating that like poison is both a condition

**Ali Leonard:** Okay.

**Tyram:** and a uh and a damage type, but yeah, it I'm afraid it doesn't do much for the damage type here. Um man, if Silus had his

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** fancy cloak, he'd have resistance to poison damage. But um you guys do not have the magic items that you had before, I will say. But um all right. So uh they'll try to stab Peaches

**Ali Leonard:** Good.

**Tyram:** again because I think they they make they don't think they have the loading properties. So actually no, no, they can use the crossbow more than once. Um all right. So I'll just roll to see who they target this time. Um uh Alma, you're up. All right. So they try to shoot you. Oh, they won. So they just they just

**Christopher Hooper:** Sorry, tucked.

**Ellis Taylor:** Hey,

**Tyram:** miss. All right. So that's the end of their turn. Um let's move on to uh peaches. Oh, wait. Sorry. No, sorry. Brew. Brew. I missed I missed

**Justin Hale:** Uh, Brew is going to uh Oh,

**Tyram:** red. All

**Justin Hale:** canon's a bonus action. So, Brew is going to use um

**Tyram:** right, go for

**Justin Hale:** firebolt. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Can I cure wound? No, because that's part of my feet, so I can't do that. Yeah, we'll just do fireball. Um

**Tyram:** it. Yeah, that

**Justin Hale:** 27 to hit. Wow.

**Tyram:** heads.

**Justin Hale:** Okay, that's a 2d10 plus an eight

**Tyram:** All right.

**Ellis Taylor:** So, I'm going to use a lucky point and reroll. It was a Oh, where did the chat go? I lost

**Christopher Hooper:** It was a 11 but now it is a

**Ellis Taylor:** it. It was an 11 20.

**Tyram:** You do a sick ass German suplex and just

**Ellis Taylor:** hit. And

**Justin Hale:** her.

**Ellis Taylor:** second, oh, not 20 on the second one. Uh, do you want me to roll damage or do you think she

**Tyram:** right. Um she has 50 HP left. If you do a

**Ellis Taylor:** dies?

**Tyram:** crit on that uh if you do a smite on that crit, I think it would actually be impossible for her to

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I'll I Yeah, I think I'll just I'll use a

**Tyram:** survive. Okay. Okay. So, that's uh let's see, that's a total of um 48 plus

**Ellis Taylor:** smite plus five to the

**Tyram:** uh Okay. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** D8.

**Tyram:** um 48 that you need to roll plus um another uh six plus uh plus 24 automatically. So 30 plus uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Jesus.

**Tyram:** 48.

**Ellis Taylor:** 48

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** 2

**Tyram:** All

**Ellis Taylor:** 15 from the

**Tyram:** right. Actually, I think that's a total of 45 then. And um you um she is still barely alive, but like you like I'm going to say like with your mighty smiting

**Ellis Taylor:** D8.

**Tyram:** strike, you uh basically like chop off one of her arms and like there's this divine explosion of power. And um next up we got um their Sander. She has 5 HP

**Ali Leonard:** I mean, I could just shoot her with my

**Tyram:** left. No, no,

**Ali Leonard:** gun.

**Justin Hale:** So, I pulled out my

**Tyram:** no. You can't do the sideways thing. That's an Ellsworth thing.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. No, she

**Ali Leonard:** doesn't know that. That's not cool yet.

**Justin Hale:** gun. The Sanders patented upside down

**Ali Leonard:** So, I mean, she did 30 damage to me and I'm only doing five. So, you know,

**Walden Briarhelm:** sir.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Well, roll the head. I mean, we got to we got to do this somewhat honest

**Ali Leonard:** like not equal yet.

**Justin Hale:** hold. So Sander misunderstood the 360 part of the

**Ali Leonard:** 360. Watch this. 360

**Justin Hale:** nocope and just went like

**Tyram:** here. Oh, yeah,

**Ali Leonard:** nocope. Okay, so that was a 19 plus eight. So 27 to

**Justin Hale:** this.

**Tyram:** that hits.

**Tyram:** it. She snaps her fingers very well. And um from all around, hidden within the trees and in the shrubs all around, a bunch of gunmen suddenly pop up and

**Ali Leonard:** would

**Tyram:** start opening fire upon uh the

**Ali Leonard:** And their sander immediately jumps in front of

**Tyram:** gang and so you are shot together. Well, I

**Walden Briarhelm:** Come here.

**Ellis Taylor:** cream. I'm

**Tyram:** themselves an easy target. And so, um, in that moment of hesitation, Peaches takes one too many shots. Um, and they fall, holding on to their best friend as they both bleed out

**Ellis Taylor:** trying

**Tyram:** together. Um, as they make their way towards the uh towards the getaway vehicle, um, we get close enough just in time to see several of the ironclaws throw some grenades right underneath the uh, fuel tank of our getaway car and they explode all at once and spoons goes up in a blaze.

**Ali Leonard:** Not the fjord.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Tomorrow's my birthday.

**Tyram:** And it looks like Silas and Brew are about to get the same treatment, but then Bruce cannon explodes right next to Helga. And um it sends her flying off to the side. And um it actually tears open the bag. And uh Hela sees that rather than the orb, Silas had placed a uh a medicine ball in there. And she sees that she does not have the true orb. And she turns and looks lividly. But by this time, Silus and Brew have ma taken advantage of their short stature. And um they manage to uh jump down into a storm drain and start beating a hasty

**Ali Leonard:** Is this cuz I was going to ground you tomorrow,

**Tyram:** retreat. Never got the chance. I was kind of hoping like you would be like

**Justin Hale:** Yes, I had you I had you murdered for

**Tyram:** uh you know like I hate you Sander and then

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Tyram:** like you never got a chance to take it back.

**Ali Leonard:** Brew? Well, he didn't save my f****** life. So, he basically said

**Justin Hale:** damn. All

**Tyram:** Well, I mean, hey, this

**Justin Hale:** right,

**Tyram:** was this is kind of a plot driven moment, unfortunately. But, um, but yeah, uh, Brew and Silas manage to run away as the hail fire rains around them. There's

**Justin Hale:** chill.

**Tyram:** several more grenades thrown into the storm drain after them, and they go off

**Ali Leonard:** that

**Tyram:** just outside of the range. And um yeah, they manage to get down into and they actually come across like where there's this big current and uh Silas is like he grabs Brew by the scruff of his neck and they both jump into the current and get swept away. All

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I think Brew is just shell shocked in the whole the whole

**Tyram:** right. And um

**Justin Hale:** thing.

**Tyram:** back at the site, uh Helga like looks at like the useless uh fake and just smashes it down. It's like put a bounty on that halfling. And uh yeah. Um fast forward to maybe about an hour or so later. Silus and Brew managed to uh pick themselves up out of the storm drain. Um, Brew still has the bag with the real orb in it. I'll say you guys are outside of the city limits now. And uh, Brew, like, um, what's what's going on with you right now as we kind of like climb out and dust ourselves

**Justin Hale:** Uh, Brew as he normally does with loss is just like completely silent. He's like shut down. Uh, he doesn't process loss well at

**Tyram:** off. Okay. Um, Silas um

**Justin Hale:** all.

**Tyram:** is kind of just like ringing his hair and like he kind of like just like just like thrashes at like everything around him. He like he's look like he's like a frustrated child almost, but then like he turns and he's like he's got tears coming out in his eyes and he's like, "This is why you don't stay. This is why you always have to move on. When you stay for a while, you get soft. You get sloppy. And this is what comes of it. I should have f******

**Justin Hale:** They're they're


### [02:40:00]

**Tyram:** left already, but but I was stupid. This is why you'd never stay. You and I, he says to Brew, he was about to say, you and I need to

**Justin Hale:** wrong.

**Tyram:** split up. It's the only way that we're going to make it. But he looks at Brew all shell shocked like just in instead of saying what he was going to say, he's like, "You and I, you and I need to stick together until we figure this out. I still got list of clients. We'll maybe this Helisana person, we'll we'll meet up with them. It'll be a cover.

**Justin Hale:** So at that moment, Brew is just like tinkering on the ground, just like focusing on anything other than that. Um, that's the first time that you see Kevin come to life and then Kevin says

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm

**Justin Hale:** his quintessential I am Kevin and then Brood just like falls into him and just like hugs him and doesn't let

**Christopher Hooper:** Kevin. I like warming

**Ali Leonard:** What the heck?

**Christopher Hooper:** hugs.

**Tyram:** Dus will like kind of like like get himself like try to like

**Ellis Taylor:** Smile.

**Justin Hale:** go.

**Tyram:** focused up and then he'll like kind of grab you. He'll like put his hand not like gently but not like harshly either like on your wrist and it's like we got to move. They're going to find where that storm train let out eventually. We have to move

**Justin Hale:** Um, okay. Yeah. Uh, Brew is like kind of like that shaking from from crying so hard. He doesn't say anything. He just kind of gets up and Okay. And then he just like starts

**Tyram:** now. Always keep moving,

**Justin Hale:** walking like just

**Tyram:** Brew. Always keep moving. And uh yeah,

**Justin Hale:** hollowed.

**Tyram:** and at this point um the memory that Silas was having fades away. Um he uh I'm gonna say that we pick back up with Silus and Brew at the Dragon Horde on the mountaintop. Um and we're watching the sunset at this point. Um, Silas goes back to the uh Bugatti and grabs uh some of the liquor that they had stored in there. And uh he pours Brew a glass like they did after previous heist and like hands brew and he also picks up a bunch of dirt. Hands brew that as well. That b**** is dead, bro. I don't know if I don't know if

**Justin Hale:** Good

**Tyram:** the rest of them care from wherever they are now, but sure felt good to

**Justin Hale:** readings. She

**Tyram:** me. I hope she gets worse

**Justin Hale:** deserved

**Tyram:** wherever she is now.

**Justin Hale:** worse.

**Tyram:** And like dirt on the tongue and after a moment's house will be like I was wrong, you know?

**Justin Hale:** about

**Tyram:** about getting soft when you start to give a s*** about people.

**Justin Hale:** what

**Tyram:** Yeah. I don't think that I would have stayed and fought if I didn't give a s*** about you

**Justin Hale:** Really? Wow. That's I

**Tyram:** guys. Maybe. Or

**Justin Hale:** think that's called the

**Tyram:** maybe I am just getting stupid.

**Justin Hale:** coral. I'm gonna I'm gonna send Kevin over to uh

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm Kevin. I like

**Justin Hale:** to Silus.

**Christopher Hooper:** warm hugs.

**Tyram:** I'll kind of like pat Kevin on the head. And uh well, for better or worse, we got a new gang now. Let's go join up with them again, I guess.

**Justin Hale:** All

**Tyram:** And yeah, that's where we'll end for tonight. Oh, and maybe Brew is

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** like, "Hey, I had this portable hole in my pocket this whole

**Ali Leonard:** Oh, that's where it

**Ellis Taylor:** There's my cord

**Tyram:** time. Maybe I mean to decide whether to stand it or

**Ali Leonard:** went.

**Justin Hale:** Wait,

**Tyram:** not, but I don't know. It actually it folds up. It

**Ellis Taylor:** hole.

**Justin Hale:** how small does it fold up

**Tyram:** specifically says to the size of like a handkerchief.

**Justin Hale:** to? Okay. When when Kevin goes over to give you a hug, I'm like, "Oh, that's where that went." And I like peel it off of his

**Tyram:** All right. So,

**Justin Hale:** overalls.

**Tyram:** maybe a portable hole in the party inventory

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm a

**Walden Briarhelm:** That was that was the most hesitant

**Tyram:** now. All right. with my temporary

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh. Hey.

**Tyram:** DM authority. I'm saying we have a portable hole now, but I'm going, you know, subject

**Christopher Hooper:** player. Sounds

**Tyram:** to veto from toe

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Ali Leonard:** Just

**Walden Briarhelm:** laughter. Excellent. Great. If I I just looked back and was like, we did like several puzzles. There is a whole RP at the beginning. There is a bunch of like moving story in

**Tyram:** later.

**Ali Leonard:** here. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** there. I'm This might be my favorite session I've been a part of. And I don't mean that to disarm

**Tyram:** Oh, that that's very flattering kind of you to

**Walden Briarhelm:** anybody. That was good. No, that was there. I don't know. Maybe it's because of just my mental state, but I'm like, damn, that was a lot. There is some really good s*** that went down. How you destroyed Helga now looking back, I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh.

**Tyram:** say.

**Ali Leonard:** right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** like, oh yeah, I'm glad you guys destroyed

**Christopher Hooper:** Uhhuh.

**Walden Briarhelm:** her farewell. they just had renovated as well as murdered the hell out of her. Like I I like this more

**Tyram:** I was trying to retroactively add some poignance to the fact that Silus wanted to shake her hand before killing

**Walden Briarhelm:** out. Oh yeah, there's a lot of good s*** there. I like this. This is just this

**Tyram:** her. Yeah, I kind of wish you had,

**Ali Leonard:** I did forget about that. So, I probably should have shaken our

**Walden Briarhelm:** played out

**Tyram:** but oh well. It's okay. The gesture was

**Ali Leonard:** hand.

**Walden Briarhelm:** well.

**Tyram:** still offered, so I feel like it still works.

**Ali Leonard:** Sorry.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, for

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe you died for

**Walden Briarhelm:** I was

**Tyram:** But I was going to let you live.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, because I was rude. Yeah, I

**Walden Briarhelm:** feel like I'm gonna

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** died because I was

**Justin Hale:** sure. That's what does it every

**Walden Briarhelm:** be I do feel like I want to step up my own DMing after that

**Justin Hale:** time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** in ways that uh have recall differently

**Tyram:** No.

**Walden Briarhelm:** because I t I tend to do very linear story and that felt

**Ali Leonard:** rude.

**Walden Briarhelm:** not it filled in so many good points of like actual plot. Sorry, I'm talking a lot. I'm excited about

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean, I think it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. This is good. That is good.

**Justin Hale:** Very excited. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** nice when like everyone knows where the story's headed to a certain extent. Um, but we

**Tyram:** Well, it does add

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, it's

**Christopher Hooper:** still

**Tyram:** dramatic irony to the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** proceedings.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So is I can

**Ellis Taylor:** true. And fun because we're all like, "Oh, I'm going to do

**Justin Hale:** awesome.

**Tyram:** Yeah, tomorrow was going to be a really eventful

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I want to ask a question

**Ellis Taylor:** this big day.

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** about I I do want to ask everybody from a DMing perspective about this because this is something I've discussed with uh group members is setting a uh kind of like an itinerary for the session saying like we have three things we need

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** day.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to do and by the end of the night I want to have completed those three. It's different than saying everybody's gonna die at the end, which you can't do for like long running campaign, I think. But setting that like beforehand so you know like we need to like kind

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** of re we need to narrow the scope back to like refocus on the what

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** we're trying to get done. Is that a good idea or does that put pressure on people to

**Tyram:** Well, this is kind

**Walden Briarhelm:** like not have as much fun and just make sure that they push

**Tyram:** of dipping its toes into the whole like railroading versus

**Walden Briarhelm:** forward?

**Tyram:** uh like uh sorry, it's dipping it toes into the railroading

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** discussion, which I think that it's only like the toxic kind of railroading if you dictate player choices. There's a fine line between saying like, you know, narrating their actions for them, which you should not do, uh, versus this is the objective that you guys must complete tonight,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, it's a little different because we're doing one

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** right? Yeah. Yeah, this was a oneshot. So,

**Ellis Taylor:** shot. We're trying to get them done tonight. If

**Tyram:** like we did there were I didn't wanted this to go on next week,

**Ellis Taylor:** a

**Tyram:** especially because Justin's not going to be here. Um, so yeah, like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Tyram:** there was a certain point at which you know I like I think a

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** couple of times yeah, Silus was like maybe we should do this and like you know just kind of like move

**Justin Hale:** you could preface it like I want to try and do these things and if that's something that your group prefers

**Ali Leonard:** Thank

**Justin Hale:** because like every group's different, right? Um, and if your but if

**Tyram:** on

**Justin Hale:** your group like appreciates that structure, you could go with that with the promise of

**Tyram:** Yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm. Yes, I think

**Justin Hale:** like not all of it has to get done, but this is what I have planned, you

**Tyram:** I I as a player do appreciate it when it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** that's the right approach.

**Tyram:** like the party has a very specific objective that they must accomplish. Like I like having a goal in mind as we're going through the

**Ali Leonard:** you.

**Tyram:** session. Um but yeah, as long as you don't tell

**Justin Hale:** know.

**Tyram:** the party how to accomplish the goal, I think that's perfectly fine. I

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** really don't consider that railroading per se.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm. Okay, this is all good

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** advice. I'm about to add another person to the group uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.


### [02:50:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** potentially. So, I'm trying to figure out how do I have the time to get us moving through plot and story and have another person like it it's definitely like a give and take trade-off sort of situation, but setting an objective I think is very on the spot for what I need because my group loves to go all over. I'm I'm all about it, but I'm like, man, we when when Ellis came back from bath time and we were like we ziplined. I'm like, yeah, that feels like that can feel like my whole night sometimes. I'm like, we didn't make it very far. So, instead, if you're on a railroad and you're on a train, sorry to use a

**Tyram:** Well, everyone gets a bad rap, but

**Walden Briarhelm:** railroad with the whole moniker, but like if you're on a

**Tyram:** like a linear story is not necessarily the worst thing in the

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, but we also like

**Walden Briarhelm:** train, right?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we also like dicked around for 40 minutes and then Taylor was like, "Hey

**Justin Hale:** Well, the old

**Tyram:** world.

**Ellis Taylor:** guys, one night." And then we like actually started doing stuff. So that was just

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** like a gentle nudge like, "Hey, let's move it along." But we still did

**Justin Hale:** The

**Walden Briarhelm:** Right.

**Justin Hale:** old trusty NPC that seemingly always gets the party

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sure.

**Ellis Taylor:** everything.

**Justin Hale:** back on track is always super helpful, which is kind of what Silus was

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah, it's also what flute was a lot in the last

**Walden Briarhelm:** Correct. I do have that in

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. And occasionally your party will

**Walden Briarhelm:** mind. Yes, I do. I did do

**Justin Hale:** tonight.

**Christopher Hooper:** just like spurn that NPC and say that they're a serial killer and they're

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** weird and won't listen to them. Um, but you give them

**Tyram:** campaign. We never pushed you out of

**Ali Leonard:** It's the two

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** an

**Tyram:** the group.

**Walden Briarhelm:** That would never happened to Toeer with every

**Justin Hale:** What are you talking

**Ali Leonard:** fits.

**Justin Hale:** about? What are you talking

**Christopher Hooper:** opportunity.

**Ali Leonard:** If the voodoo doll

**Walden Briarhelm:** NPC. Friendly little girl who gives you gold for free.

**Christopher Hooper:** You must have

**Ellis Taylor:** You did go a little

**Justin Hale:** about? I think that's I think that's less about uh what you're trying to

**Ellis Taylor:** hard.

**Justin Hale:** do and what we want to do to

**Ali Leonard:** fits also have very strong opinions about NPCs and they always

**Walden Briarhelm:** to flattering P.

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** quit.

**Ali Leonard:** come true.

**Justin Hale:** Honestly, my favorite thing to do is is create chaos and have Toeer come up with the

**Ali Leonard:** You have to. Yes. And

**Justin Hale:** most crazy yes and response to it. It's the best. It's great because he'll come out with some s*** and you're like, "Damn it, that's

**Christopher Hooper:** Ally. Ally is

**Tyram:** Well, like Ally has a real

**Justin Hale:** good." All right. All right. Let's

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Tyram:** talent for like coming up with like really stupid but very fun things for the NPC to like be. So like yeah, f*** it. Yeah, Blackwell

**Justin Hale:** go. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** one. Ali challenges me the most

**Tyram:** became a vampire. Why the hell not? Like I had no romance

**Ali Leonard:** absolutely.

**Christopher Hooper:** for sure.

**Tyram:** planned for this session, but sure. Yeah, there's this is a romcom

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** now.

**Ali Leonard:** Can't help

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. So my analogy would be you're on a train headed towards big city. Uh by the end of the night I'd like for us to reach the big city. Is that a fair objective to set for the group or would it be I would

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** like for us to be close to getting to the city? Like I'm really wanting to make sure I don't I don't want to interfere with fun. Like fun is the most important aspect for

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, I mean, are they driving the

**Walden Briarhelm:** me. No, let's I I this isn't a real example. I'm making this

**Ellis Taylor:** train? Are they in control of the

**Walden Briarhelm:** s*** up on the fly. Let's say they're passengers on the train. They've just stolen a

**Ellis Taylor:** train? Oh, okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** bunch of stuff and they need to go to the big city where they can sell it and make

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Walden Briarhelm:** money. I would say you guys have all this stuff you need to protect. You know what you need to do, but by the end of the night, I'd like for us to be as close to getting

**Ali Leonard:** I personally wouldn't say anything and I would

**Walden Briarhelm:** into the city as

**Ali Leonard:** just adjust behind the screen to what they're

**Tyram:** Well, that is also a good point. Um, all of this is theater of the

**Ali Leonard:** doing cuz like

**Walden Briarhelm:** possible. Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah. Same

**Tyram:** mind anyway at the end of the day, right? So, like maybe the thing you need them to run into

**Ellis Taylor:** here.

**Tyram:** is going to have more than one way that it could possibly show up,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, that's key. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** always. Yeah, it's Yeah, you write you write

**Tyram:** right? Yeah. I mean,

**Walden Briarhelm:** reactions, not story plots or

**Tyram:** like like okay, for example, with tonight, right? Um I wanted to make sure that the Order of St. George showed up at some

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** point, right? If you guys had gone in and started fighting, they probably

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** would have shown up a lot sooner in the session because that would have made sense to introduce them at that point. I kind of had like a a number of like triggers in mind for them showing up, right? Like you guys go in and start fighting through the first floor, they're going to show up almost right away. um you guys uh manage to set off an alarm or something at some point and they get into a a kind of like a cat and mouse with the Pandora gang, um they might show up like maybe in the middle of it. But the final trigger that and this was the thing you guys had to do anyway was opening the box like getting into the middle of the vault. That was the they

**Christopher Hooper:** Seven.

**Tyram:** are definitely showing up by now if they have not shown up yet uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, that's a good thing to have as like a final a I don't want to call it final, a default trigger. Like no matter

**Tyram:** trigger.

**Walden Briarhelm:** what it'll happen here. There's other potential conditions that could trigger.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. And that's part of the that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, that's still reactionary. That's the right choice.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. That's

**Tyram:** part of the skill you develop as a DM, I think, is

**Justin Hale:** a

**Tyram:** thinking of ways to introduce things in a way that is logical and makes sense based off of like you are reacting to the players, right? Like their actions could go any number of different ways, but try to anticipate different paths

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** they could take and like, you know, have something ready. And occasionally they will do something that just completely surprises you, right? something you were not ready for. And that's just you have to develop a sense of improvisation as a

**Walden Briarhelm:** every

**Tyram:** DM to be able to just roll with it when that does

**Walden Briarhelm:** time. Yep. Yep. I

**Justin Hale:** One one thing that I always do too is if I have like really important NPCs, I I flush them out in like a mind map.

**Tyram:** happen.

**Walden Briarhelm:** agree.

**Justin Hale:** I'll make like motives and like their influence on the world and like opportunities where they could potentially come in. So like they don't

**Ellis Taylor:** Thank

**Justin Hale:** necessarily have like a a story cue that brings them

**Ellis Taylor:** you. We're just

**Justin Hale:** in, but like if they go to this town and it's like, "Oh, this person has

**Ellis Taylor:** talking.

**Justin Hale:** influence in this town. They may be here for this reason." Then I can pull that person in because

**Walden Briarhelm:** Get the time.

**Justin Hale:** like I have all these little like backstories for those NPCs that are big deals to to come in. But like if my party decides like, "f*** that town, we're going over here." That big bad may have influence all over the world. So, like now they're doing like, you know, back door dealings in that town or something. Just like a way to pull them in. And yeah, I don't I don't ever really like set things out super far in advance because the

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** world is going to be molded by your

**Tyram:** Like

**Ellis Taylor:** I think of the story more as a web than like a story line.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** It's like this can all happen here and influence each other. It's like,

**Tyram:** It's also good to like consider like

**Ellis Taylor:** "Oh, I can pull this over

**Justin Hale:** players.

**Tyram:** with your villains and something especially they're allowed to react to what the players have done, right? Like in the last campaign, the uh the big bad was the dwarven emperor, right? And you guys did several things

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. What?

**Tyram:** that interfered with his planned sequence of events. And so he was able So like what would he do now? The players have done

**Ellis Taylor:** now.

**Tyram:** this. How is the bad guy going to react to what the players have done? They have

**Walden Briarhelm:** Right.

**Tyram:** an objective, they have an endgame, and they should always

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** be like, you know, be able to pivot towards that endgame based off of what the players have done. Now, this guy had a huge advantage because he is he's the emperor of the most powerful industrialized country in the world. So, he had a lot of resources. He had a lot of ability to change his plans as the party did things that interfered with his plans. And so eventually, and they didn't even meet the f****** emperor until like the second to last session, I think.

**Ali Leonard:** But we had him

**Tyram:** But yeah, and he didn't necessarily even know their names. He just knew that like, oh s***, that that key piece that I wanted is gone. What do

**Ali Leonard:** clocked.

**Tyram:** I do

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. Matt Mercer actually had a really cool really cool talking point in a in an interview one time where he was saying like just because the world is revolving around your players doesn't mean that the rest of the world

**Tyram:** now?

**Justin Hale:** stops. So like every time that the players did something, the other sides behind the scenes were still reacting to what they were doing. So like the big bad in campaign 2 fundamentally shifted their efforts of what he was thinking canonically in his head because of what the party was

**Christopher Hooper:** I took that advice and already wrote out a sequence in this campaign of if there are no heroes. Um, which has been

**Justin Hale:** doing. H

**Christopher Hooper:** fun.

**Ali Leonard:** What do you mean? No

**Justin Hale:** nice. What are you trying to say? What are you trying to say,

**Christopher Hooper:** I'm just saying I I've made no edits, so it's been

**Tyram:** Yeah. We just saved the city. We're totally heroes.

**Ali Leonard:** heroes.

**Christopher Hooper:** great.

**Ali Leonard:** You mean Elizabeth is going to die?

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, I want to go back briefly. Instead of my example being I want the objective to be that you guys make it to the big city, would it be more enticing to players and it sets me up better as a reactionary like system

**Justin Hale:** Toer?

**Walden Briarhelm:** for DMing to say, uh, tonight I want our objective to be that you guys protect the bounty, the the gold, the

**Tyram:** I feel like

**Ali Leonard:** I wouldn't say any of

**Walden Briarhelm:** whatever you're transporting.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** the I would say the objective is basically independent of what the

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** no.

**Tyram:** players decide to do, right? How they decide to do

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. If you put me on a train and I

**Tyram:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** got a bounty, what do you want me to like I don't just be

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I

**Tyram:** Yes.

**Ali Leonard:** like, what do you want to

**Walden Briarhelm:** meant I I used the wrong word. I meant like they stole

**Ali Leonard:** do? Right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** a bunch of stuff. Your job is by the the objective of tonight is to just keep it protected or whatever. Don't don't let it be interfered with. It sounds like that's not the right direction either. This is a particularly hard one for me and that's why I'm using

**Tyram:** I wouldn't use like the objective you

**Walden Briarhelm:** this example is you're going

**Tyram:** give the player should always be something they're proactively doing. Protecting something is a reactive action, right? Like are they trying

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** somewhere. Okay. Okay. How's that?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. I mean, it could be a

**Tyram:** to get the treasure to a certain place? Are they trying to uh escape a danger that they know is coming? That's different than just like, "Hey, who knows what's gonna happen tonight? You guys better keep that treasure safe." You know, like you need to give them something to actively

**Walden Briarhelm:** I get

**Ellis Taylor:** job.

**Tyram:** pursue rather than

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. Right.

**Ellis Taylor:** Or it could be like their job, like

**Tyram:** like Yeah, it could be something like

**Ellis Taylor:** they're hired to protect it. But like you can also make it based on their

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Is it

**Tyram:** that.


### [03:00:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** characters. Like say go back to the hangover. Olivia's missing. Yeah, Brew probably doesn't give a s***. But like

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Elizabeth, I know, is going to like spend her entire time tracking her down.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't like being told what my objective

**Ellis Taylor:** It's probably going to drag them with

**Tyram:** Yeah,

**Ali Leonard:** is, but I like being led to my

**Ellis Taylor:** them. Yeah. Yeah. a leader lead them there

**Tyram:** that was smart DMing. Like knowing how Ellswith would

**Ali Leonard:** objective.

**Ellis Taylor:** like I

**Tyram:** react and just relying on that to kind of like uh set the

**Ellis Taylor:** know.

**Tyram:** objective.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. It's this one particular type of

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** session. It's the like going somewhere because I I did a pirate campaign. So there's I I wanted to make travel time a actual element of it. And I keep finding myself when we're moving from one object or from one thing to maybe the next big quest line or next big island, like I don't know how to fill that part. Well, but as far as like when we have a clear interest or a clear plot

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, I would say

**Walden Briarhelm:** points, then setting an objective is very obvious. What are you going to say,

**Christopher Hooper:** the thing I used to have this trouble and then I was

**Walden Briarhelm:** Top?

**Christopher Hooper:** like, you don't actually need to play out travel. Like literally play out scene to scene. Like unless unless you like actually want a scene where they have a complication while they're traveling or something interesting happens, just have them show up at the next point,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Ah, I see.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I kind of tried to make the ship like a bastion. I don't know if you guys are familiar. So, I wanted to make it so they each have something they can improve on and work on

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** during the travel just because I wanted the kind of feel of like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** you guys are out at sea and when you're traveling, you have that time to do that because they have a ghost crew that runs the whole ship for them. So, it's like how do you I I you can see why I'm having some I'm I'm This is one of the few ones I really stumble with. Everything else has been pretty

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Walden Briarhelm:** easy,

**Ellis Taylor:** mean, we did that in the last campaign with the ship, the like tree organic ship where Joel creates a like

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, it's kind of like

**Walden Briarhelm:** though. I love

**Ellis Taylor:** druggy orange grove. No. No. What did you

**Tyram:** Why does this sound so strange out of

**Ali Leonard:** a what to do. like we're reaching our

**Walden Briarhelm:** your guys' callbacks a

**Ellis Taylor:** do, Taylor? I know. Taylor, what did

**Tyram:** context?

**Ali Leonard:** destination. What did you do?

**Walden Briarhelm:** little bit.

**Ellis Taylor:** you do though? You just kind of like Yeah. Taylor just like asked us like, "Hey, what are you doing?"

**Justin Hale:** I gotta go to

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. See you.

**Ellis Taylor:** And we just like dicked around for like 30 minutes and it's like, "Cool. We're there now.

**Justin Hale:** bed. Bye,

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Like I don't

**Walden Briarhelm:** Can I cry? So

**Justin Hale:** guys.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** mind having a week to think about it and then being like,

**Walden Briarhelm:** then that's that's what travel is like. Travel is literally what are you

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah, downtime can be an opportunity to like,

**Walden Briarhelm:** guys doing or what have

**Tyram:** you know, do stuff like work on magic items or, you know, like shop or

**Ali Leonard:** "Yeah,

**Ellis Taylor:** Bye.

**Tyram:** whatever. It's also a great opportunity just to let the players like the characters interact with each other,

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** you.

**Tyram:** right? Like That's

**Ali Leonard:** for

**Tyram:** the thing that makes them feel like, you know, they're actual like, you know, friends and comrades

**Ellis Taylor:** like shields

**Tyram:** and like living breathing people like uh shame that Justin

**Ellis Taylor:** pranks.

**Tyram:** just left because like that uh that ship session where

**Ali Leonard:** sure.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** um that's where I think Shield started pranking for the first time and that became basically a defining feature of the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Yep.

**Tyram:** character um moving forward. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He did that thing where like he uh did like the bungee

**Ellis Taylor:** Yep. He tried to climb up a

**Tyram:** corn thing and it didn't work and it almost killed

**Ali Leonard:** We were reading the romance

**Ellis Taylor:** tree and he

**Tyram:** Joel.

**Ali Leonard:** novels book

**Ellis Taylor:** fell. Yeah. We created a romance novel like book

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** club.

**Ellis Taylor:** club cuz we also had old people on the ship too. We were like moonlighting

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah. Like these can be

**Ellis Taylor:** as a cruise for old people. Oh

**Tyram:** opportun now that can be really hard for like you to

**Ellis Taylor:** yeah.

**Tyram:** um try to foster as a DM, but they are opportunities for the players to develop a personality basically, right? Develop their quirks and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sure. So that's I got it.

**Ellis Taylor:** Dane had trees that she always slept

**Tyram:** manorisms.

**Ellis Taylor:** in.

**Tyram:** Yep.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yep.

**Walden Briarhelm:** where grab some of these. So, uh I want to abuse the dagger heart system so that I don't have to try any harder. There's a series of like background questions that they give in. Maybe that's how I can set it up. Be like, "So, as you guys set sail for this new island, um I feel like this is a good opportunity for you guys to get to know each other better." Um, person A, what did you do that made the people in your community wary of you? And that's an opportunity for them to share it with the group. Or is that not the right

**Ali Leonard:** I think it's kind of the right approach. I think it's too specific.

**Walden Briarhelm:** approach? Okay. No, that's fair. That's fair. These are um these are

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** I think it's on the right. But I mean just like

**Walden Briarhelm:** specific to like your characters. So

**Ali Leonard:** how and everybody obviously plays very differently and

**Walden Briarhelm:** that's

**Ali Leonard:** I like to just and they know this but I just like to be given like a so what do you

**Christopher Hooper:** Is it the

**Ali Leonard:** do? But some people some

**Walden Briarhelm:** Right. You like that open-endedness of it. Okay. I think

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** people definitely need more direction

**Walden Briarhelm:** that and I think that that is a sign of your

**Ali Leonard:** but I

**Walden Briarhelm:** experience because you're like, "Please give me a green field opportunity." When I do that,

**Ali Leonard:** just like to play off of what everybody else is doing. I like to Yes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I get a lot of

**Tyram:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** And

**Walden Briarhelm:** like of my group only one person. Well, now two

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** people are experienced, so they take those opportunities and are like nom nom

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** nom. They eat away at it and they love it. Other people, I feel like I need to give a narrow it just a little bit so that as soon as you can be like, oh, I

**Ali Leonard:** everybody

**Walden Briarhelm:** think I know how to answer this. Then they bloom into a really fun

**Tyram:** That can be really hard because like Yeah. You don't you don't want to feel like

**Ali Leonard:** Taylor's really good at

**Tyram:** you're forcing it.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** idea, right? I hate that feeling like

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** Taylor's good at being like, "Okay, so like you guys set up a

**Walden Briarhelm:** I've picked on you now as you know

**Tyram:** And you know, it's like people were saying earlier though,

**Ali Leonard:** bonfire like create

**Tyram:** like, yeah, but it's like some people were saying earlier,

**Walden Briarhelm:** like a

**Tyram:** that might just not be something that a player is even looking for in the game,

**Christopher Hooper:** H.

**Tyram:** right? Um, and if they don't want to do it, then, you know, that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** lot.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** their business. But I guess I would probably try to find out from

**Ali Leonard:** situations.

**Tyram:** them outside of game time like do you want

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sure.

**Tyram:** more opportunities for your character to uh just do the fat with the other characters? You know, the answer might be no, but if it is yes, then you guys I think that's a good thing to talk about outside of session

**Walden Briarhelm:** Right. Agreed. Agreed. And I typically try to end our sessions with like a 10-minute just

**Tyram:** time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** how did you feel? Or specifically if I put someone on the spot, I'll just message them afterwards privately like how did you feel about me saying like here's this open-ended thing. You're the captain of the ship. What would you do? And made you have to like take that spotlight. Sometimes people

**Christopher Hooper:** I would I would say

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** don't like

**Christopher Hooper:** to that point uh especially if it's a new player uh sometimes I

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** I might do is like send them a message ahead of time and be like I I'll probably ask you this during session so if you want to pre-prepare it ahead of time you can.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Okay. Okay.

**Tyram:** And we've been talking a lot about tonight about like skills you develop as a DM. That's also a skill set you develop as a player, right? Like how can

**Ali Leonard:** nice.

**Tyram:** I like give my character like a personality, give them a

**Ali Leonard:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** motivation while also not just making things a ridiculous farce, right? Like I feel like Justin is very talented

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Yeah.

**Tyram:** at he does these characters that have these weird kirks that

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** they do like really zany stuff but it never goes to the point where they are just ruining whatever the DM wants to do that night. Right. And that is he is very good at tiptoeing up to that

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Right. I

**Tyram:** line and not crossing

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I don't disagree in any way. I

**Tyram:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** envy that ability because I'm like, man, I don't feel like I ever get that kind of pressure. And every time he does it to to I'm like how how and the answer is and yes or uh yes and like yeah

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** yeah that does happen but and I'm like okay so it's like a it's improv it's pass it back and forth improv

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** and yeah I'm just I am as I feel like I am as new as most of my players. Like we average out about the same. I have a lot more exposure having played with you guys and running DM. there's just a if you can only play once a month and we've only been playing for X months, like that's very limited. So, I'm still trying to find that sweet spot. But, I mean, one of my players used a voice for the first time last session. I was like, and they were they're quiet. They're

**Ellis Taylor:** Voices are so

**Walden Briarhelm:** typically quiet, but they're an orc character. And I talked to him outside. I was like, just like pretend you're biting your upper lip and

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** speak like orc prank. I was there was a little bit of it. I was

**Ellis Taylor:** hard.

**Walden Briarhelm:** like, "Holy s***." And I didn't make a face or anything. I was just like, "Mhm, this is great. I don't care." And other people have really I feel like other people have jumped in on the like

**Tyram:** There you

**Walden Briarhelm:** adding to sessions. But that's I think that the very big difference is Daggerheart plays differently with spotlighting than D&D does. DND is everybody can talk, but initiative matters and

**Tyram:** go.

**Walden Briarhelm:** dagger is uh spotlight matters, but order doesn't in

**Christopher Hooper:** And Dagger Heart

**Walden Briarhelm:** combat. That's those are one of the two

**Christopher Hooper:** specifically is like players should help build the world in a way

**Walden Briarhelm:** big

**Christopher Hooper:** that Dn D is

**Walden Briarhelm:** yes that is. And that's fun.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Tyram:** Well,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Like I passed it to a player who we have a whole background for her and I said I set it all up and then I said, you know, it's at that moment that character name uh starts to

**Tyram:** yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** you feel energy radiating from her ma magic energy. And I passed the spotlight to that player and said, "Would you explain what you're feeling?" And they got the

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** opportunity to lay out their whole background, tell this great story about it. And everybody got to listen and like, "Oh s***, we're who's the DM now?" And it really felt like they laid out everything. And they added stuff that

**Tyram:** Yeah. Awesome.


### [03:10:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** I didn't care about. I was like, I we only had like a little bit of structure and they added so much color and depth to it all. I was like, "This is what I think Daggerheart's really trying to do." So, I think we're succeeding in that element, but it can be hard to it can be hard to know if we're doing things right or not, or if we're approaching a border that's like we're

**Christopher Hooper:** I did

**Tyram:** And you know

**Walden Briarhelm:** going to have issues if we keep trying to go this

**Tyram:** there is a certain point where you can one of the trickiest things to do is like at what point as a DM do you need to say no don't do

**Walden Briarhelm:** direction.

**Tyram:** that there like I have a bunch of like newbie players at school right now one of them tried to like just basically start stabbing people in the middle of a bar just like normal completely innocent people. They

**Ali Leonard:** Sure. River

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Tyram:** weren't even like they they wouldn't even have accomplished anything. They didn't have any money for these people to

**Ellis Taylor:** Murder. Yeah.

**Tyram:** take. And so, you know, I did have to like kind of tell the player in the middle of the session even where it's like you are part of a group and these are actions you would take that would ruin this situation for everyone. I want you to rethink doing that.

**Ali Leonard:** hobo.

**Tyram:** So, and yeah, that's another thing that that's another very important thing for people to

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** internalize as players because players do have their share of the responsibility here. You are part of a team. You should not design a character

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** and you should not take actions that f*** things up for everyone

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, unfortunately a lot of DMing is also So like organizing and managing a group of people to

**Tyram:** else.

**Christopher Hooper:** work

**Tyram:** Yeah, I think that we have

**Walden Briarhelm:** I don't feel like I have that problem at

**Christopher Hooper:** together. That's

**Tyram:** like I'm really happy that we have a group that like I

**Walden Briarhelm:** all.

**Tyram:** don't think we have any s******* players in our group, you know, where like, you know, it can be a real pain when somebody wants to be the f******

**Christopher Hooper:** good.

**Tyram:** main character. It can be especially a real pain when somebody wants to like just be a f****** like to go past that line that Justin doesn't go past where they ruin the f****** situation every goddamn time. I have had players in a group that I played with who have done that sort of thing and it is

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** miserable. Like they just unilaterally like kill

**Walden Briarhelm:** anarchy. Yeah, you're just constantly

**Tyram:** the f****** NPC who was the key to saving the world and you

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** know s*** like that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** off. Right. Well, there's I've read about situations like that and I haven't ran into it, but all my players are like adults who they want they have objectives, but I've not ran into a chaos element for my players

**Christopher Hooper:** I'll say like um

**Walden Briarhelm:** yet.

**Christopher Hooper:** for me like my my

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** passion in this comes a lot from like being a theater kid and like loving improv and so that's some of my favorites. Um, and you don't like I it also gets me in a lot of binds as a DM doing yes and a lot. And so you don't I encourage you, you do not have to do that. You can always say like you can always like push back and I encourage you to find ways to be like um like you know just be open with

**Ali Leonard:** No,

**Christopher Hooper:** like uh I don't actually know how to fit that into the story

**Ali Leonard:** but

**Christopher Hooper:** but that is really funny you know um stuff like that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Right, right,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um if if it's like oh s*** I don't I don't know how to yes and this like um but like for me I

**Walden Briarhelm:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** I usually am like ah I'll figure it out later you

**Ali Leonard:** I DM'd my cousins

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, these are all good lessons.

**Ali Leonard:** who'd never played and didn't know anything about D and D. So I gave them like

**Christopher Hooper:** know. Nice.

**Ali Leonard:** homework before we played.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I give homework every

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. So I was like, "Listen to Nad Pod. Listen to this. So that you can get like the rhythm and see how other improvisers do

**Walden Briarhelm:** week. I think this

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** I guess we do need to decide who wants to DM next

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** out. I have an idea, but it's not it's just

**Ellis Taylor:** Right. That's

**Walden Briarhelm:** fun. I'd rather give it to somebody who's doing something that's plotw

**Ellis Taylor:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** I don't mind doing mine. I haven't written it, but I can put it

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Good

**Tyram:** I mean, it sounds as good as anything else to me.
