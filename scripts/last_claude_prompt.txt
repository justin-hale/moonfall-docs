**Justin Hale:** hair. Like it's it's real and like when I let it grow out, it's not like curly like yours, but like it'll start to curl

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. I guess I guess the is not so much curly as just kind of like

**Justin Hale:** up. Hers is hers is pretty damn curly. Uh, Silia is convinced that it's going to stay curly like

**Christopher Hooper:** mess. That'd be

**Ellis Taylor:** or get curlier. My little brother had like

**Christopher Hooper:** cool.

**Ellis Taylor:** soft curls when he was little and then when he grew up it became like tight

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** corkcrew like Shirley Temple

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I uh my parents didn't cut my hair till I was like four, so I had like

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, that's

**Ellis Taylor:** hair.

**Justin Hale:** long hair as a and I had little ringlets, but not

**Ellis Taylor:** Wow.

**Justin Hale:** not to the degree that Thea has. Thea has like curly ass

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Ted has my hair texture. It's so funny and blonde.

**Justin Hale:** hair. Yeah.

**Tyram:** Were you ever blonde when you were younger or was it

**Christopher Hooper:** funny.

**Tyram:** always

**Ellis Taylor:** I was I had like it was lighter, but my hair photo bleaches. So if I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like start of high

**Ellis Taylor:** out in the sun, then it gets

**Tyram:** darker?

**Christopher Hooper:** school. I remember I thought your hair was like fairly blonde to dirty blonde and it got darker and darker like throughout high

**Ellis Taylor:** light. Yeah. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** school.

**Ellis Taylor:** because I would go to summer camp every year, every summer. And so I'd

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** be in and out of the pool. I've been in and out of chlorine. And then like there was no such thing as inside. And I'd be there for a month straight. So my hair would like every time I went people like, "Did you dye your hair?" I'm like, "No, just give it till the end and it'll be light

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** again." And not on purpose. It's the

**Justin Hale:** Not on

**Ellis Taylor:** chlorine guys in the

**Justin Hale:** purpose. Yeah, mine uh mine used to do that. Mine used to do that from uh

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** sun. Oh.

**Justin Hale:** suntan lotion. So, I would like sun my face and we'd go out uh every weekend on the boat and my hair would lighten up

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, that's

**Justin Hale:** everywhere that the suntan lotion was touching. It was

**Tyram:** I feel like you shouldn't be rubbing suntan lotion in your hair, but yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm. I think

**Justin Hale:** bizarre.

**Christopher Hooper:** it's it

**Justin Hale:** Well, this and then it gets all over the place.

**Tyram:** whatever.

**Justin Hale:** My uh my mom was absolutely crazy about sunscreen because uh one of my buddies was

**Christopher Hooper:** happens.

**Ellis Taylor:** wild.

**Justin Hale:** uh he was a ginger like full on like blonde hair, not even orange hair that like white almost white hair and pale skin and he went out on the boat with us one time

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh oh

**Justin Hale:** and he forgot to reapply. He like applied sunscreen once then forgot to

**Christopher Hooper:** no. Oh

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Justin Hale:** reapply. Ended up having to go to the hospital

**Christopher Hooper:** no. Oh

**Ellis Taylor:** no.

**Justin Hale:** for sun Yeah. So, ever since then, my mom was like,

**Christopher Hooper:** no.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** "Okay, no, we're setting timers. You guys are putting on

**Tyram:** Well, better safe than sorry with stuff

**Justin Hale:** sun every 30

**Tyram:** like that. I guess 30 minutes might be a little bit of a quick turn around,

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. I got some

**Justin Hale:** minutes." Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** poisoning. Oh, I bet. I got

**Justin Hale:** She felt so bad. She felt responsible for him

**Tyram:** but

**Ellis Taylor:** some poisoning as a kid. I've got like a scar on my chest that like

**Justin Hale:** for

**Ellis Taylor:** doesn't tan. It's like this white spot. Like just like this white scar.

**Justin Hale:** really. Oh, yeah. I I had one of those on my back. I had to get it cut out. They had to

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Justin Hale:** biopsy it because they thought it was skin cancer. Yeah. Mine Mine was like scary. Like it was like bubbling over

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. No. Yeah. I know. It's just like this kind of like area that's just like spot

**Justin Hale:** and like starting to

**Christopher Hooper:** wow. It It started talking to

**Ellis Taylor:** that just doesn't tan

**Justin Hale:** like Yeah. Yeah. Mine was

**Ellis Taylor:** anymore.

**Justin Hale:** like I was like, "Hey, you doing up

**Christopher Hooper:** you. I'm Kevin.

**Tyram:** Oh man, I don't know if I'm on board with like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** there?" That's That's the origin

**Tyram:** aggressively Brooklyn and

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, I finally

**Tyram:** Kevin. That's

**Ellis Taylor:** seen uh Minions or Despicable

**Tyram:** good.

**Ellis Taylor:** Me. Finally.

**Justin Hale:** again. Not or those are two those are both different movies.

**Ellis Taylor:** I've seen I we watched all of the pickles bulls that are out and then we watched the Minions

**Justin Hale:** Which one

**Tyram:** So, you've seen them all like that. I don't think I've ever seen any

**Ellis Taylor:** movie.

**Justin Hale:** did Yeah.

**Tyram:** of them all the way through except for the first one, but they're

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** So,

**Tyram:** good.

**Ali Leonard:** I've I've seen the first one and that's

**Justin Hale:** really, I love the

**Tyram:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** Cute. I think the Minions movie is

**Justin Hale:** first one. I'll watch the first one. Yeah, the first one's

**Tyram:** mean, I feel like they hit a good sweet spot where

**Ellis Taylor:** funnier.

**Tyram:** like they're inoffensively funny, you know, and the minions

**Ali Leonard:** it.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** are, you know, funny enough that like, you know, just you

**Justin Hale:** fantastic.

**Tyram:** can see why they have like a million like memes and movies and s*** like

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I I really like Despicable Me one and then

**Tyram:** that.

**Justin Hale:** I really like the first Minions movie. The rest of them just kind of fall off for me,

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. There's

**Justin Hale:** but those two for sure I really

**Tyram:** Well, there's the second Minions movie. Isn't it

**Ellis Taylor:** multiple minions

**Justin Hale:** enjoyed.

**Tyram:** basically just like Despicable Me prequel because it is like Kid Grew or something?

**Ellis Taylor:** moving. Oh, okay. Oh,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, it's it's literally called the rise of grew.

**Tyram:** But, you know, I feel like the the real heavy weight from that

**Ellis Taylor:** jeez.

**Tyram:** era of movie making is probably the Kung Fu Panda movies.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Really f****** good. like genuinely great

**Ellis Taylor:** Are they

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** movies. Well, the fourth one's the fourth

**Ellis Taylor:** really? Cuz I saw an ad for another one. I was like, how is there another one of

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** one's fine. The first one is good. The second one is like genuinely one of the best animated movies ever made.

**Ellis Taylor:** these?

**Tyram:** Yeah. And the third one's pretty good,

**Ellis Taylor:** Really? That seems like a tall order

**Justin Hale:** That trilogy is really

**Tyram:** too. It's out

**Ellis Taylor:** for animated

**Justin Hale:** good. I mean, okay, first of all, the main character is

**Tyram:** there.

**Justin Hale:** Jack Black. So, like, come

**Tyram:** Jack Black is genuinely a treasure, especially in his voice acting roles. Hey,

**Justin Hale:** on.

**Christopher Hooper:** What do you think? You want to say

**Ellis Taylor:** Hi. Hi,

**Justin Hale:** Um, I

**Christopher Hooper:** good night? Good night. Good

**Ellis Taylor:** Astred. Good

**Justin Hale:** Good

**Tyram:** Ash. Sweet

**Ellis Taylor:** night. And but when you

**Justin Hale:** night. Oh my

**Christopher Hooper:** night. Say good night,

**Tyram:** dreams.

**Ellis Taylor:** say animated, you're all of a sudden sticking him in there with Miyazaki.


### [00:10:00]

**Justin Hale:** god.

**Christopher Hooper:** Taylor.

**Tyram:** Okay, there's so many there's a wide range of animated movies and like you know I guess like narrowing it down to one single like best is probably impossible

**Christopher Hooper:** Good

**Tyram:** because like you know they can be good for different reasons but legitimately Kung

**Ellis Taylor:** So

**Tyram:** Fu Panda 2 is a great movie. I'll just I'll just say it like that. How about that?

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. I'll have to watch it. Yeah. And that'll be easy one to talk

**Tyram:** Um, when it comes to Miyazaki, I have a hard

**Ellis Taylor:** Ted into

**Tyram:** time differentiating between best and

**Ellis Taylor:** watching.

**Tyram:** favorite. Like, I think the I think the best one is Spirited

**Ellis Taylor:** That's

**Tyram:** Away, but I think my favorite one might be uh Castle in the Sky. I don't know. That's a hard discussion. That was

**Ellis Taylor:** fair. I think my favorite's how's moving

**Ali Leonard:** This guy hasn't watched

**Ellis Taylor:** castle.

**Ali Leonard:** him. We just started watching Pirates of the

**Ellis Taylor:** Allie, good

**Ali Leonard:** Caribbean. No. So, we watched one and two of

**Ellis Taylor:** lord. Has he not seen that

**Tyram:** good. I never saw the fourth or fifth pirates. Are those

**Ali Leonard:** Pirates and

**Tyram:** okay?

**Ali Leonard:** then I mean I they're fine, but like one, two, three

**Ellis Taylor:** either? Do you remember

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** are like

**Ellis Taylor:** going Which one did we go see in theaters together? We

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. No, no, no. That was Harry

**Ellis Taylor:** like went opening night dressed up as pirates. I remember writing in your

**Justin Hale:** Castle.

**Ali Leonard:** Potter. Mid

**Ellis Taylor:** that was no we've done that too cuz I went dressed as McGonagle mid transformation

**Tyram:** Is that

**Ellis Taylor:** cuz I was

**Tyram:** just cat

**Ali Leonard:** transformation. It was

**Ellis Taylor:** like I had a cat outfit and a witch

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** ears? Okay. Okay.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, it was

**Ellis Taylor:** outfit on at the same time. But I

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Hear me. I gotta

**Tyram:** Um, I

**Ali Leonard:** like from my childhood like like costume

**Justin Hale:** go.

**Tyram:** remember I remember Ally and I had like a low stakes

**Ellis Taylor:** also

**Tyram:** wager over whether Spider-Man 3 or Pirates 3 would make more money and I obliterated her with Spider-Man 3 and

**Ali Leonard:** closet. I am a pirates girl till I die, but

**Tyram:** that and honestly Spider-Man 3 is probably the worst of that original trilogy

**Ali Leonard:** whatever.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. The first one was really

**Tyram:** but there was no way it wasn't going to make like a billion f****** dollars,

**Ellis Taylor:** good.

**Tyram:** you

**Christopher Hooper:** I feel like that's

**Ali Leonard:** I'm really bad at

**Tyram:** It wasn't a complete slam

**Christopher Hooper:** a pretty good wager. like Pirates was a huge

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Tyram:** dunk, but I was pretty confident that Spider-Man was going to outperform

**Ali Leonard:** Huge.

**Christopher Hooper:** franchise. Plus,

**Ali Leonard:** I also didn't realize how at the time how big

**Tyram:** Pirates. It was really just taking off at that point. Like Spider-Man 3

**Ali Leonard:** like superheroes

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** was like three or four years before Iron Man came out. And Iron Man's what kicked

**Ali Leonard:** are.

**Tyram:** off the MCU.

**Ali Leonard:** But they were thirsty for it. They

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Well, yeah. like the Spider-Man movies and the X-Men movies really primed the

**Ali Leonard:** were thirsty for

**Tyram:** pump for uh for superhero movies for

**Christopher Hooper:** like

**Tyram:** sure, but I feel like um we're kind of circling back around now where like I you know

**Christopher Hooper:** But I feel

**Ali Leonard:** that.

**Tyram:** I'm in a position where like man I f****** love superhero movies and then everyone else is like yeah they're fine. And then like for a good 10year stretch there everyone was like yes f****** love superhero movies. And now we're kind of going back to where it's like, man, I f****** love superhero movies. And everyone else is back to

**Christopher Hooper:** like

**Tyram:** they're

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Dude, I was over superhero movies like halfway

**Christopher Hooper:** It was really

**Ali Leonard:** I got lost.

**Ellis Taylor:** through the Marvel shenanigans. I was like, do we really need to keep doing

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** this? I still have never seen a Captain America all the way through.

**Tyram:** fine. You're a fool because those are some of the best

**Ellis Taylor:** I just kind of refused to do at this point.

**Ali Leonard:** I like I think I did the Captain

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, he's just

**Tyram:** movies. Winter Soldier is maybe one of the best action movies

**Ali Leonard:** America. I did the Iron

**Tyram:** ever made. Not just superhero movies, action

**Christopher Hooper:** fun.

**Ellis Taylor:** boring.

**Tyram:** movies. All right. All right. It's

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm also not an action movie person. I would rather be

**Tyram:** also true that I don't ever get tired of anything

**Ali Leonard:** Man.

**Tyram:** ever. Like I can watch the same movie. I can play the same

**Ellis Taylor:** laughing. This is

**Tyram:** games. I do not get tired of

**Ellis Taylor:** true. You and Ted will get along great. We're watching uh Billy and the Tramp for the eighth time tonight. Or he and

**Ali Leonard:** Anyway, I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** Keith are a night off

**Tyram:** things. Well, no. I think Ang's here.

**Christopher Hooper:** But this is one of the things I love about Astrid is that she likes to watch

**Ali Leonard:** sorry.

**Ellis Taylor:** somehow.

**Christopher Hooper:** different things. She likes to save things for later. Just just a a really great

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, normally we can get him to watch something new or get

**Christopher Hooper:** kid.

**Ellis Taylor:** him really excited to watch something new, but sometimes he just is like, "No, I want to watch

**Ali Leonard:** Is

**Ellis Taylor:** this." Like, "Okay, at least it's not Bug's Life

**Ali Leonard:** it?

**Ellis Taylor:** anymore." Though, we've been reading the same book for a month straight, and it's driving me a

**Christopher Hooper:** Also, have y'all seen Cars

**Ellis Taylor:** little

**Christopher Hooper:** 2? No. It's

**Ellis Taylor:** crazy. Yes. is

**Christopher Hooper:** like so crazy, so all over the place.

**Ellis Taylor:** not. Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** And especially for a like a toddler, it's like totally incomprehensible what's going on cuz it's

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** all like James Bond references and stuff like that.

**Ali Leonard:** What's

**Christopher Hooper:** Uh, is it

**Ellis Taylor:** 100%. Cars 3 is actually really

**Christopher Hooper:** okay? We'll have to check that one

**Ellis Taylor:** good. Yeah.

**Tyram:** I feel like there's like not really a much of a middle ground when it comes to Pixar sequels. They're

**Christopher Hooper:** out.

**Ali Leonard:** wrong?

**Tyram:** either amazing or they're like bad. They're not like bad by Pixar standards, but like Toy Story 3, one of the best movies ever made. Toy

**Ali Leonard:** Poopy.

**Tyram:** Story 4 completely

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Who's going to see

**Tyram:** forgettable. I saw that they really should have quit while they were ahead.

**Ali Leonard:** Toy Story 5? They should.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Tyram:** Like, yeah, Toy Story 3 was like the

**Christopher Hooper:** Toy Story 3 was the end. Like Toy Story 3

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Toy Story 5 is happening. Kill

**Ellis Taylor:** What?

**Tyram:** perfect way to end that series of movies and then they just made another

**Christopher Hooper:** was legit awesome. Like the end.

**Ali Leonard:** me.

**Tyram:** one, you know? That's just what it it just felt like they were just like spinning their wheels like they didn't have any good ideas. So, let let's just make a Toy Story movie is what it felt

**Ellis Taylor:** What?

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I don't know why Toy Story 4 had to

**Tyram:** like. I mean, I'll

**Justin Hale:** exist. Well,

**Tyram:** reserve judgment till I've actually seen it, but yeah, I'm not excited about

**Ali Leonard:** or I'm

**Tyram:** it. It was not

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** prejudging as I always

**Justin Hale:** yeah. The story was over.

**Tyram:** only over, it was very Yeah, it was so well

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** do. It had a perfect

**Tyram:** wrapped up. Like I have rarely ever seen an ending to a

**Ali Leonard:** end. A beautiful little button on the

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Enough.

**Tyram:** trilogy that completely pitch perfect. And it was

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** also coming out like they timed it really well because the kids who saw the first movie

**Ali Leonard:** end just

**Tyram:** when they were young, it was about the age where they were graduating or going to college. So like it was so perfectly

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yep. Yep.

**Tyram:** timed.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Ali Leonard:** like

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Well, didn't Disney have like a panic about like new content and they're like I feel like Pixar themselves came out and said like, "Oh, our bread and butter is not going to be new new stories. It's going to be like old like retelling old stories or like sequels

**Tyram:** I doubt they would just straight up state that in a press release. That

**Ellis Taylor:** and stuff like that like after like Coco or something like

**Justin Hale:** Well, then it's

**Tyram:** sounds very like a very cynical thing for them to say,

**Ali Leonard:** Coco was so

**Ellis Taylor:** that. I think I

**Tyram:** but was

**Ali Leonard:** good.

**Ellis Taylor:** think it happened after Coco came out cuz Coco came

**Justin Hale:** time

**Ellis Taylor:** out during it was it was amazing movie but it came out during the pandemic so it didn't like make the money they

**Justin Hale:** Yes. Let's base all

**Tyram:** good.

**Ellis Taylor:** wanted. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** of our decisions on a pandemic.

**Tyram:** I

**Christopher Hooper:** Why did no one go to theaters

**Justin Hale:** Like I hate Disney, dude. Disney gets on my

**Tyram:** mean, I did. Now, to be fair, I

**Christopher Hooper:** during a pandemic. What the

**Ali Leonard:** Just a quick little

**Justin Hale:** nerves,

**Tyram:** did not go see Elio, which was their most recent like completely new

**Christopher Hooper:** hell

**Tyram:** one. I did go

**Ali Leonard:** pandy. I haven't seen the last few.

**Justin Hale:** right? Wasn't

**Tyram:** see Elemental, which I thought was good. I liked

**Ali Leonard:** I saw elemental. You're right. Never mind. I I saw a bunch of clips and I went to

**Ellis Taylor:** Was

**Justin Hale:** that I love elemental.

**Tyram:** Elemental. Wild Robot was not Pixar. That wasn't them. That was

**Ali Leonard:** see that.

**Ellis Taylor:** wild was wild robot then? It wasn't. That was so

**Tyram:** DreamWorks. Wild Robot was really good. Like at first I

**Christopher Hooper:** everybody? Is that a good movie?

**Ellis Taylor:** good. Oh, speaking of good

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** thought when they showed the first trailer I thought it was going to be a dialogue free movie. I'm like, man, that's really cool. I'm going to enjoy the hell out of that. Then I found out it wasn't. And so I was like, ah. But then

**Ellis Taylor:** content.

**Tyram:** I saw it and it actually was still good. So, you know, kind of ran the

**Ali Leonard:** No.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Oh.

**Tyram:** gambit on that one. Oh man. But

**Christopher Hooper:** That's one. That's one I

**Tyram:** um uh Wild

**Christopher Hooper:** want to watch. Is that a good one for like young

**Tyram:** Robot, I think it's fine for young

**Christopher Hooper:** kids? Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, yeah, Ted watched it. It was fine. I had to

**Tyram:** kids. Now, some they do have a

**Ellis Taylor:** explain what was happening, but he wasn't

**Tyram:** somewhat pityless view of nature because like there's a scene

**Ellis Taylor:** scared.

**Tyram:** where like the possum thinks one of her kids had just been eaten by a predator and she had like no reaction. So, it is a little a

**Ali Leonard:** Oh yeah, I saw that

**Tyram:** little I guess I I used I'll stick with

**Ali Leonard:** clip.

**Ellis Taylor:** I thought it was funny as

**Tyram:** that. Well,

**Ellis Taylor:** a parent. I thought it was funny. Just like the overstress. She's just like an

**Tyram:** it wasn't like cruel or mean or anything like that, but like they had a

**Ellis Taylor:** overstressed parent who's got too many

**Tyram:** very unromantic view of nature, which is kind of interesting because

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** they also show a lot of really gorgeous shots of like, you know, landscapes and like ducks flying and all sorts of like just amazing visuals of nature. But they also, I feel like, have a pretty, let's say, downto-earth view of like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Realistic view of

**Tyram:** Yeah. Well, yeah. like they do recognize that animals

**Ellis Taylor:** nature. I mean

**Tyram:** don't always give a s*** about their offspring, I

**Ellis Taylor:** also

**Tyram:** guess, or each other. Oh, yeah. They're all pretty

**Ellis Taylor:** for each other like they have to force them to hang out and not

**Tyram:** casual about like eating each other and s*** like that. So,

**Ali Leonard:** Oh my

**Ellis Taylor:** kill each

**Tyram:** yeah. But yeah, it was a good movie. I would recommend

**Ali Leonard:** god.

**Tyram:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Great.

**Ellis Taylor:** other.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, everyone's here who promised to be here. So, um,

**Tyram:** Uh,

**Christopher Hooper:** should we dive into recap? Um, let's see. What should be the prize for the recap? H maybe maybe I'll dole out uh gold coins.

**Tyram:** sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** So we'll start the bidding at five

**Justin Hale:** Guys, guys, we have a unique and

**Walden Briarhelm:** You've given

**Justin Hale:** rare opportunity

**Walden Briarhelm:** us too much


### [00:20:00]

**Justin Hale:** here. If we

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I'm not biting for

**Justin Hale:** if we maintain

**Tyram:** Maybe unionize and demand an increase to our wages real

**Christopher Hooper:** gold.

**Ellis Taylor:** that

**Justin Hale:** solidarity,

**Tyram:** quick.

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. Five gold

**Walden Briarhelm:** power.

**Christopher Hooper:** and a cursed

**Ellis Taylor:** change. You're

**Tyram:** We already have a curse

**Ellis Taylor:** not taking my cursed

**Tyram:** in the party that we don't actually use. What kind of incentive is

**Justin Hale:** I'm telling

**Christopher Hooper:** sword. All right. All right. No cursed sword.

**Ellis Taylor:** sword.

**Justin Hale:** you, we already got one pieces of

**Tyram:** that?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, how

**Justin Hale:** s***.

**Christopher Hooper:** about um, let's see. A really stinky sock. Like, u

**Tyram:** Do you understand how incentives are supposed to

**Christopher Hooper:** magically magically

**Ellis Taylor:** I think Tober's just telling us he wants to do the

**Justin Hale:** I don't think he does.

**Christopher Hooper:** stinky. Um, all right. All right. All right. I We'll get some good things. Um, a party

**Ellis Taylor:** recap.

**Tyram:** work?

**Christopher Hooper:** hat. Uh, limited edition party

**Justin Hale:** No,

**Christopher Hooper:** hat. Goat

**Tyram:** What kind of

**Christopher Hooper:** armor.

**Tyram:** armor? Like armor that just has like

**Christopher Hooper:** Goat

**Tyram:** goat like aesthetics to it? Like what do you mean by

**Christopher Hooper:** armor. No.

**Ali Leonard:** Does it make you look like a

**Christopher Hooper:** Armor. Armor for a goat. Like you know the legendary like Skyrim DLC force

**Tyram:** that?

**Christopher Hooper:** armor.

**Ali Leonard:** goat? I have no dog in this fight. I can't do the recap.

**Ellis Taylor:** Why would I want an armor for a goat? I don't

**Tyram:** You do don't you you have a RAM? Is

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, we do have a

**Ellis Taylor:** have I have a

**Tyram:** that not close

**Ali Leonard:** It doesn't fit. Yeah, it wouldn't

**Ellis Taylor:** sheep. The fit would be all wrong. He's so fluffy.

**Tyram:** enough? So, could it be ram

**Christopher Hooper:** goat. Um,

**Tyram:** armor?

**Christopher Hooper:** a a um Oh, yeah. It could

**Ali Leonard:** fit. Then that would just be

**Christopher Hooper:** be ram armor. Oh yeah,

**Ali Leonard:** for the truck.

**Christopher Hooper:** dodrian. I feel like that would be a truck that

**Tyram:** Those are

**Christopher Hooper:** like broke down at the worst possible

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** time.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Justin Hale:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** Or y'all drive drunk. Y'all could drive a Dodge Ram drunk. I

**Ellis Taylor:** No.

**Christopher Hooper:** think that's that's it. Stereotype.

**Justin Hale:** I

**Tyram:** Tacomaomas.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Justin Hale:** also I can't remember what happened last week. Too much has happened in my

**Walden Briarhelm:** We got on a

**Justin Hale:** week to remember what happened last

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, we got on the

**Walden Briarhelm:** boat with a

**Christopher Hooper:** boat. Um, let's see. Yeah, you

**Justin Hale:** week.

**Tyram:** I like how normally we just do this,

**Christopher Hooper:** and you chatted with Rafael.

**Walden Briarhelm:** wyvern.

**Tyram:** but now it's become like a drawn out negotiation.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, we met Bafel, the Monk Brotherhood members who knew, finding out that a pretty big set of

**Tyram:** That's getting ahead of ourselves. Don't say that

**Walden Briarhelm:** news, which was that um

**Tyram:** yet. All right. Um, going in order because you're messing this

**Walden Briarhelm:** the

**Tyram:** up. Um, all right. So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** the Oh,

**Tyram:** the session started with us um in the

**Christopher Hooper:** um

**Walden Briarhelm:** okay.

**Tyram:** uh stronghold of the Order of St. George, the dragon hide, where um the people in the bar area um like to fight and they f*** all

**Christopher Hooper:** which was discussed as potentially just being a a Rocka's bachelor

**Tyram:** night. No, no, they're f****** But

**Ellis Taylor:** Come

**Tyram:** um I don't know. Maybe they are, maybe they're not. None of us stuck around

**Christopher Hooper:** party.

**Tyram:** to watch. But um anyway, but downstairs though, we got a full night's sleep. got in our long rest and in the morning we um talked to the leader of the order of St. George uh Tanninbon, I think her name was

**Ellis Taylor:** on.

**Tyram:** like Tannenbomb, something like that. It was like the German word

**Ellis Taylor:** Peace.

**Tyram:** for Christmas tree is what it reminded me of. All right, I'm going to go with tan and

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, yes, it's some it's something like

**Tyram:** bomb until I hear otherwise. Um so

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Tyram:** she gave us a um assignment. She wants us to take our dragon orb to a shrine and uh perform a ritual. Um, not only should this reseal uh our evil super dragon that's inside the ore, but Astro Namin, I can never remember the full name, but Astro. Um, but apparently they would use some um equipment to try to use the uh energies from the ritual or something like that to uh locate the other dragon orbs. And um so we agreed to go do that with them. And then Silas and Brew went to go talk with uh with uh I mean I can't remember our gang leader name. Their Sander. Yeah,

**Justin Hale:** Thanks

**Tyram:** we went to go talk with Thrander. Thirander appears to be mostly retired now. Like they've gotten out of the game. We did find out the Order of St. George people were using their sander as bait to try to lure out the uh the

**Justin Hale:** for

**Tyram:** iron claws. And so that's how ultimately they got blown up. Um

**Christopher Hooper:** Their standard did have a lead on of flower ice or something like

**Tyram:** probably Oh, I didn't take that seriously

**Christopher Hooper:** that.

**Tyram:** at all. So I just kind of I'm not going to talk about it

**Christopher Hooper:** I

**Tyram:** now. But um that's that's my

**Christopher Hooper:** know. All

**Ellis Taylor:** I thought he was just trying to get them to become

**Tyram:** was my interpretation. Yeah. So they

**Ellis Taylor:** bakers. Yeah.

**Tyram:** they're they are all the way in on baking. Like that is their whole personality now. Um well, we

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Tyram:** did find out that um okay, Tannondelle, okay, not Tannon Bomb. But um we did find out from Thrander though that the Ironclaws do hang out at our old bar, the Cog and Steam. So that's a quest line that Brew and Silas might try to pick up on later uh to try to take down the Iron Claws here in Greyport. Uh but does seem to be basically out of the game now. So uh we're just going to basically part ways from Thrander. So Xander's going to go back to just being a baker now, it seems. Um

**Justin Hale:** Right.

**Tyram:** um trying to think it was relevant. I don't think anything really relevant happened late until we uh got ready to depart. We're going to have to take a boat out to this ritual site. And that's where we did meet Rafael. And I guess Zach, if you want to tag in and tell your conversation with Bafael now. Go ahead.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sure. Thank you. That actually was a really important detail that I just completely jumped past. Um, we met Bafel, um, one of the other monks from my monastery that is now destroyed, and he let us in on a pretty big secret, which is the order of, uh, St. George is actually working handinhand with the Eldorians and we don't like them. They're the ones who shot down the uh the moon that is or was my uh or's goddess that they worshiped and um he's let us know that they have bad intentions. So, we are

**Ali Leonard:** I'm going

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh scheming and putting together a plan as to what we're going to do once we're there. And also the uh the area that we're going to is both

**Ali Leonard:** to

**Walden Briarhelm:** a ritual site and where the moon goddess fell because it's kind of like a magical zone in general in this world. And that is how it has the power to re-energize the dragon orbs. And uh what's interesting is it's being protected or guarded. I don't really know yet. I don't know that any of us do. But there are dragons swarming it. and we are going to have to be taking

**Ali Leonard:** Hold up.

**Walden Briarhelm:** on several different things at once. And uh in charge of the uh the members who are part of the order of St. George is Bafel. So we have this unique

**Ali Leonard:** Stop.

**Walden Briarhelm:** situation where we are friendly with their leader who isn't really friendly with them. And I don't know

**Ellis Taylor:** Um, the

**Walden Briarhelm:** if there was any other big thing that happened before we signed

**Ellis Taylor:** most important thing was the rowing and Silas's complete

**Walden Briarhelm:** off.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah, that's true. That's so

**Ellis Taylor:** ignorance about how boats work.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So boat

**Tyram:** That was so not relevant that I actually completely forgot about that till just

**Christopher Hooper:** true.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** launching in this world

**Ellis Taylor:** I wrote it down in my

**Justin Hale:** It was arguably the most relevant part of last week.

**Tyram:** now. It whatever. Apparently boats in this setting are completely nonsensical in row instead of using motors.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, it's because they're in the no wake

**Tyram:** Yeah. So just keep it on the lower throttle. That's just how they

**Christopher Hooper:** zone. I feel Listen,

**Tyram:** do it.

**Christopher Hooper:** you know, like it's okay if you don't if you don't know how harbors and boats like it's fine.

**Ellis Taylor:** notes. You don't need to get so upset, Taylor. You're being like really emotional

**Walden Briarhelm:** to

**Ellis Taylor:** and like a little hysterical, bud. Like, calm

**Walden Briarhelm:** be fair. Let's be fair. Silus Silus was right because you would use a robo to get in and out from Harbor. You wouldn't take your whole ship in. That's obnoxious,

**Christopher Hooper:** defend him.

**Ellis Taylor:** down. I love the

**Walden Briarhelm:** right? Like you would you would want

**Tyram:** But I guess one thing that is worth saying though is that like you said the

**Christopher Hooper:** Zack

**Ali Leonard:** Jesus.

**Tyram:** uh order of St. George had bad intentions. Arguably they didn't. They seem to think they're the good guys here. But um they have allied themselves

**Ellis Taylor:** size.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sorry. Oh, okay. His

**Tyram:** with Elderan. And so that might be uh something we might want to look into as well as if we can it might be theoretically possible for us to convince these George folk that Elderan is not someone they should ally with. I don't know. just

**Ellis Taylor:** Do we know if Do we know if these

**Tyram:** it's I don't know

**Ali Leonard:** Beautiful.

**Ellis Taylor:** George folk are cool with like dragon born or

**Tyram:** if well dragon born don't exist in the


### [00:30:00]

**Ellis Taylor:** whatever? Yeah. What is the What is it the Oh, wait. They don't exist at all.

**Tyram:** setting the last campaign um the only

**Ellis Taylor:** Was that the last

**Tyram:** dragon born in existence were like the four that you guys met and they're gone now.

**Ellis Taylor:** campaign? Who were the people that came? Was it Telings then that came through the

**Tyram:** So these are the ones who came through the portal.

**Ali Leonard:** It's

**Ellis Taylor:** portal like long time ago? Okay, it was

**Ali Leonard:** already tempered.

**Ellis Taylor:** Telings. Okay, never

**Walden Briarhelm:** This does raise a

**Ali Leonard:** 120 seconds. I

**Ellis Taylor:** mind.

**Walden Briarhelm:** question I've wanted to ask since we signed off. Would there be

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** speedboats that are crystal powered in this

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Walden Briarhelm:** world? That's f****** sick. That was that was my big moment

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** for today was wanting to know the answer to that.

**Christopher Hooper:** I thought Taylor al Taylor and Justin maybe

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** were coming up with an interesting some interesting ideas too at the end about trying to

**Ali Leonard:** said

**Christopher Hooper:** sabotage the sensors

**Tyram:** Yeah, I put that on Discord last week.

**Christopher Hooper:** um or something like that.

**Tyram:** Yeah, that um one way we one thing we could try to do where we uh f*** over the Georgia's plans to go find the other dragon orbs and help the elder but also not make them our enemy at least immediately is we could try to surreptitiously sabotage their sensors and um that way they'd be like, "Oh no, it didn't work." And we'd be like, "Oh well, what a shame." You

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I don't

**Ellis Taylor:** I want to know how long they've been working

**Tyram:** know, there's a lot we could ask about that. Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** This is I want to

**Ellis Taylor:** with Elderand. Yeah, because

**Justin Hale:** Oops.

**Tyram:** Like I'd also be curious they know about all like the genociding that Elder Rand

**Ellis Taylor:** I want to know if they were like. Yeah. And if they were involved, you know, in the attack on High

**Tyram:** does. Yeah, there's a lot we could ask them

**Ellis Taylor:** Forge or

**Tyram:** about. So, if they know all those things and are still teaming up with Elderan, then

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Tyram:** we're probably inevitably just going to be enemies with these guys. But

**Ali Leonard:** Fair

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** um if they aren't aware of those things, I don't know, maybe we

**Ali Leonard:** I don't

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Tyram:** can make them have pause about allying with

**Christopher Hooper:** right, we ready to dive in? Seems as good as anything. All right, so um right, so last we left off, we were on the route to the

**Ali Leonard:** know.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** crash site in the ocean. Um you're on this boat.

**Tyram:** them.

**Christopher Hooper:** We're now beyond the harbor and uh the sails are let loose. The motor is running um and we're jetting away and at a certain point uh comes to you and

**Ali Leonard:** Foreign Foreign speech. speech.

**Christopher Hooper:** says have you spoken to your party? We should speak again before we arrive at the crash site.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes, we have spoken. You should come with me now.

**Christopher Hooper:** come to my port is is quite big. Uh and he uh he goes below deck. Um and he he has a room. Um he shows you and says, "Gather the others. I will be here."

**Walden Briarhelm:** goes and gathers the

**Justin Hale:** What time is

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I don't know. What do you

**Justin Hale:** it?

**Tyram:** probably like midday, right? Didn't we like kind of get on out to the docks like late

**Christopher Hooper:** think? Yeah, I think

**Walden Briarhelm:** others.

**Christopher Hooper:** it's I think it's probably like just before noon time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** How does that influence Brew's

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what Brew would be doing at

**Walden Briarhelm:** decision? Is Is Brew comfortable on

**Justin Hale:** noon

**Tyram:** morning?

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** a boat?

**Justin Hale:** routinely.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm I

**Justin Hale:** Is there a reason he

**Christopher Hooper:** interesting. A lot of people are uncomfortable on boats.

**Ali Leonard:** He's from the back of a sea turtle, so I think Brew would be

**Tyram:** Yeah. Like I can't imagine any of our characters

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, he's

**Tyram:** having a problem with a boat for any

**Justin Hale:** wouldn't? I can't

**Ali Leonard:** fine.

**Justin Hale:** remember what dumb stuff I've said in the past either, though, so I didn't know if that was based

**Tyram:** reason. I don't nothing's coming to mind. In the last

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** fine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I

**Justin Hale:** on some dumb comment I

**Tyram:** campaign, we did have a party member who was like deathly afraid of

**Walden Briarhelm:** No.

**Justin Hale:** made.

**Tyram:** modern transportation

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes, that was fun. She was a complete

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's

**Christopher Hooper:** Bring your

**Ellis Taylor:** ludite and it was a

**Tyram:** technology. I wonder how DNE would feel about like Formula 1 racers like Ellmith

**Ellis Taylor:** blast. Oh, buddy. We're gonna have to explore that one

**Tyram:** has. She is still alive.

**Christopher Hooper:** hand.

**Ellis Taylor:** day, aren't we? She's still alive.

**Tyram:** You m************ all like Fluke is the only dead character

**Walden Briarhelm:** funny.

**Tyram:** from the last campaign. All of you like, "No, no, my precious darling character is still alive 250 years

**Christopher Hooper:** I left mine

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. We all

**Christopher Hooper:** opened. You kept mine alive for

**Justin Hale:** Hey, you tried

**Christopher Hooper:** me. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** to kill your own character during the campaign. I don't want to

**Ali Leonard:** Caspine could be dead. We have no idea.

**Justin Hale:** hear

**Tyram:** later. I know.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** picked

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. So, uh, y'all gather into Bafael's room. Say, and he says, "Oh, thank you. Thank you for gathering everyone. Have

**Walden Briarhelm:** You are

**Christopher Hooper:** you decided what you are going to do when we get to the crash

**Walden Briarhelm:** welcome. We have a few plans. Silus

**Christopher Hooper:** site?

**Walden Briarhelm:** and Brew have been working on something. What have you guys

**Tyram:** Why?

**Justin Hale:** I have concepts of a

**Tyram:** Sorry.

**Walden Briarhelm:** concocted?

**Justin Hale:** plan. I have concepts of a

**Tyram:** Second. Well, I mean, our concepts usually, you know, work themselves out, but okay. So, um, we are in a bit of a dicey situation

**Justin Hale:** plan.

**Tyram:** because if nothing else, these guys are our ride home. So, um, we don't want to mess that. You know, the fate of the world is one thing, but the inconvenience of having to find someone else to take us back to town is a bridge too far. So, um, we were trying to come up with a way to maybe thwart their plans to try to find more of these orbs and help the Elder people without necessarily giving ourselves away as their enemies. Say

**Christopher Hooper:** How much money do you

**Tyram:** what? What does that have to do with

**Christopher Hooper:** have? Do you have a lot of money on you? The boat is hired. And I selected the Dragon Knights with us. I chose this crew. I chose

**Tyram:** Anything you s***?

**Christopher Hooper:** them because fool listen. I chose the dragonites that do not care about being killing dragons or whatever. They are mercenaries. So if you have money, we can take this boat back.

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, that's good to

**Tyram:** What? No. That's a terrible idea. Why would we spend money when we don't have to? No, we

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, you can

**Ellis Taylor:** know,

**Tyram:** we can have our cake and eat it, too. We don't have to like these guys are already hired out, so we don't have to pay them a dime,

**Ellis Taylor:** honey. Honey, do we need to talk about this? I feel like you and Naomi have already had this conversation about being a

**Tyram:** right? Okay. You know what? It's a

**Christopher Hooper:** swim.

**Ellis Taylor:** cheapkate and nickel and diamond. Like sometimes you have to just spend a little

**Tyram:** mute point. I have one gold coin in my purse right now, so I don't even have the money anyway.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think you

**Ellis Taylor:** money. What are

**Tyram:** No. like my ring

**Ellis Taylor:** you spending money

**Tyram:** and

**Christopher Hooper:** misunderstand. I think you misunderstand. Right now they have allegiance to

**Ellis Taylor:** on?

**Tyram:** stuff.

**Christopher Hooper:** St. George but only because of money. If

**Tyram:** No, I got

**Christopher Hooper:** you if you give them a price, they will swing. But right now, they are aligned with St.

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** George. So if you do something, they will fight you unless you offer a

**Tyram:** Or we do something and they don't

**Christopher Hooper:** better price and a

**Tyram:** realize we did something and then they don't have to we don't have to pay them

**Christopher Hooper:** better

**Tyram:** s*** and they still just do whatever they were they just take us home, right? Who

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, before before we figure if we're going to like, you know,

**Tyram:** cares?

**Ellis Taylor:** betray everybody, I feel like we need a little bit more information on the George

**Tyram:** They f***

**Ellis Taylor:** dudes. Um, these saints. Um, so do

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. Good.

**Tyram:** all

**Ellis Taylor:** you know do you do you happen to know how long they've been working with

**Christopher Hooper:** How long? Um, maybe. No, I do not. I only got here a month ago and

**Ellis Taylor:** Alderan?

**Christopher Hooper:** they were all already working

**Tyram:** night.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. That's just because, you know, we know for a fact was part of like my city sacking. So, and they've also done a lot of

**Christopher Hooper:** together. Other end stacked

**Ellis Taylor:** war crimes.

**Christopher Hooper:** your city. What city? What? The dragons sacked High Forge. That's where most of our recruits come from.

**Ellis Taylor:** So yeah, honestly I kind of think Elderan like staged it. They showed up way too

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, that is news

**Ellis Taylor:** fast.

**Christopher Hooper:** to

**Ellis Taylor:** This is just a working theory.

**Tyram:** Well, okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** me. Okay,

**Tyram:** So, listen for a sec. They are going to try to during we this ritual, which we do need to do the

**Christopher Hooper:** so


### [00:40:00]

**Tyram:** ritual. That's another thing that's worth stressing here. Regardless of any future alliance implications, this ritual needs to happen because the evil dragon god in the orb needs to be resealed more thoroughly. So that's just a moot point, right? We just need to go ahead and just do that with them no matter what. But that only furthers the ambitions of Elderan, apparently, if they're able to use the equipment they have with them to try to locate the other orbs. What if we just sabotage their equipment? What if we make it look like it just didn't work, that they're not able to track it, and then they have no idea that we're working against them, and we just go home. We just stop working with them when we get home, you know?

**Christopher Hooper:** I ask you this though. What is your final goal? Are you fighting the dragons and elder?

**Tyram:** Look, we're No, I'm I'm I'm personally not super invested in the whole fighting against empires thing. I just want to deal with this dragon and then uh Brew and I have some

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Tyram:** ambitions to f*** over the Iron Claws. that I'm not really

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** uh you know committed to the cause of any of these

**Justin Hale:** What the he said?

**Christopher Hooper:** You know, you know the tale of Luna and Noraxis,

**Justin Hale:** They have

**Christopher Hooper:** right? Yes. Well, Noraxis

**Justin Hale:** tails. Why do they have

**Christopher Hooper:** does. Because Noraxis is a

**Tyram:** groups.

**Christopher Hooper:** dragon.

**Ellis Taylor:** And his girlfriend was

**Tyram:** and they found out that they couldn't be

**Ellis Taylor:** the moon.

**Justin Hale:** tails?

**Tyram:** together and it was super

**Christopher Hooper:** Do you remember more of

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** sad.

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Ellis Taylor:** It's probably in my note

**Tyram:** It was a few months ago. Um I think both for me the character and for the player.

**Christopher Hooper:** story? They well the important part they couldn't be together because they destroyed everything around them when they were

**Tyram:** Um,

**Christopher Hooper:** not when they were together in

**Ellis Taylor:** somewhere.

**Christopher Hooper:** love. We needed to create balance and separated them. I say this here

**Tyram:** yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** because not every destructive force is evil. It is in itself an aspect, an agent of chaos, an element of our universe moving forward. I say this because you you think, oh, they destroy my city. They are evil. Well, a scorpion is a scorpion, right? But is a scorpion evil?

**Ellis Taylor:** That is a scorpion

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** chaos.

**Christopher Hooper:** what? There's a scorpion.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm confused.

**Justin Hale:** How many

**Tyram:** Damn it, they're scorpions

**Christopher Hooper:** What? Well,

**Justin Hale:** scorpions do we have?

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** I there is two at the zoo. They are very beautiful.

**Justin Hale:** All right. So, what do we need to do with these

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, do not put it on a on the back of a

**Justin Hale:** scorpions? Uh,

**Tyram:** I feel like putting on the back of a turtle would be fine because they'd be protected

**Justin Hale:** you Hey, Elmo, you hear

**Tyram:** by their shell. It's the back of a frog that's really

**Christopher Hooper:** turtle. Ah, you would

**Walden Briarhelm:** You

**Tyram:** susceptible.

**Christopher Hooper:** think. No, for us

**Walden Briarhelm:** are wrong. It is a very bad omen for

**Justin Hale:** that?

**Christopher Hooper:** it

**Walden Briarhelm:** what? One scorpion, three scorpion, five scorpion, but two

**Christopher Hooper:** tell that is how we tell

**Walden Briarhelm:** never. Thank you for bringing it up, Brew. That

**Tyram:** I feel as though we're kind of losing

**Walden Briarhelm:** was very

**Tyram:** the thread

**Walden Briarhelm:** important. Yes. You know, Bafel, I think that Silus and Brew have a good point. If we can trick them into

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** thinking that they've done something wrong or that the ritual did not work

**Tyram:** here.

**Walden Briarhelm:** because of their own mistake, then we get what we want. They've done what they came to do, failure or not. All we must do is allow them to fight the dragons. allow us to re-energize the old. find out maybe what happened to Luna and then we can

**Christopher Hooper:** I I think that is okay. But I worry that maybe this orb is the only way to bring Luna back. What other entity is strong enough to bring our god back into

**Tyram:** I thought this had an evil dragon who was not

**Christopher Hooper:** the

**Tyram:** Luna's

**Christopher Hooper:** sky. No, it is the the sister of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hey,

**Tyram:** boyfriend. So, how does the orb help us in any way with Luna then?

**Christopher Hooper:** Noraxis. It is a very powerful

**Tyram:** But I feel like just any powerful dragon will

**Christopher Hooper:** dragon.

**Tyram:** do. That doesn't sound

**Walden Briarhelm:** You know, Bafel, they have discussing that there are many of these dragon orbs. Perhaps we should venture to find

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the dragon orbs and use them all to bring back Luna. Maybe we should not rely on the power of such an evil

**Tyram:** right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** being. What do you

**Christopher Hooper:** Do you do you think the orgs are other dragons? I assume they were

**Walden Briarhelm:** think?

**Christopher Hooper:** all

**Walden Briarhelm:** I had grown a strong opinion based purely on their name uh and assuming that that they

**Christopher Hooper:** astral

**Walden Briarhelm:** would all be dragons.

**Christopher Hooper:** maybe. I don't know. I find it difficult to believe one god could fit in one orb.

**Tyram:** But okay, so circling back though to the big

**Walden Briarhelm:** H.

**Tyram:** picture here, wouldn't I don't think it's worth it to break open these orbs. Even if you get Lunas back, just release a big evil dragon. I mean, that's just that's a bad result, man.

**Christopher Hooper:** I've returned to original question. Why? Why is this dragon

**Tyram:** They f****** told me they were going to f****** eat the

**Walden Briarhelm:** This did

**Tyram:** world. It's not This is an unambiguously evil

**Walden Briarhelm:** happen.

**Christopher Hooper:** evil? They will eat it.

**Tyram:** dragon. That's their title, isn't it? Like they eat they want to consume

**Justin Hale:** That's what they

**Tyram:** everything. Wasn't that basically what they told me?

**Christopher Hooper:** Cool. So like uh if

**Justin Hale:** said.

**Christopher Hooper:** Noraxis is like a sun then this is like

**Tyram:** Yeah. Are they the They're the

**Christopher Hooper:** a like the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** void dragon. Isn't that their actual

**Christopher Hooper:** void.

**Tyram:** name? Correct me if I'm wrong. If I

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Tyram:** misunderstand the situation, please let me know.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I feel that you may be holding something back that you know you seem hesitant with our idea. What is it you know that we are not savvy

**Christopher Hooper:** I do not know your direction. I don't know. You seem like you think about what is right now, but I don't know what the end goal is. You fight the dragon.

**Ellis Taylor:** Honey, with

**Walden Briarhelm:** to?

**Christopher Hooper:** You fight the empire. Are you going to fight everyone?

**Ellis Taylor:** me

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait, if you knew this

**Justin Hale:** if they want

**Tyram:** I

**Ellis Taylor:** probably. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** group as well as I have grown to know them, that is very typical.

**Tyram:** mean, I feel as

**Ellis Taylor:** am fully for the downfall of Aldorin at this point. Between the war crimes trying to take over my entire civilization, I want them down and the f******

**Justin Hale:** to.

**Tyram:** though you have Olivia has

**Ellis Taylor:** moon. There used to be one. Their moon goddess is fake. They broke the

**Tyram:** wrong opinions about like fake moon goddess.

**Ellis Taylor:** real one.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Yes. I want to me I want to take down Eldoran more than anything and that includes working with the

**Tyram:** Yeah. The dragons are a good

**Christopher Hooper:** dragons. That is my belief.

**Ellis Taylor:** I just need to know wait what is the dragon's ing game and why are they linked up with Aldoran in the first place? Like I'm just not convinced we can trust these guys. Are they really that simple? Their in game is just kill all dragons cuz not all dragons are like bloodthirsty

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey, the Aldorans. My belief is the Aldorans wish

**Ellis Taylor:** killers. No, I'm talking about the dragon

**Christopher Hooper:** to the dragons seek to kill all

**Ellis Taylor:** dudes. I Aldorin Aldor just No,

**Christopher Hooper:** dragons.

**Ellis Taylor:** the St. George

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah. No, they hate dragons. That's why

**Ellis Taylor:** guys.

**Christopher Hooper:** they come

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I know. I'm just confused as to why they're working

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Ellis Taylor:** with the Aldorans and what their end game

**Christopher Hooper:** My understanding is that they

**Ellis Taylor:** is.

**Christopher Hooper:** are working to with the Eldorans because the Aldorans can finally kill the gods including the Draconic gods. Noraxis

**Ellis Taylor:** Why are they going to kill all the gods? Yeah, I

**Walden Briarhelm:** cuz then their god Eldora becomes more

**Christopher Hooper:** They

**Ellis Taylor:** got that. But like


### [00:50:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** powerful. Well, they're they're they're like trying to pump Eldor to like more powerful god, and they found these guys who are just like a bunch of frat bros who like to chug beer and f*** all night and fight and kill dragons.

**Christopher Hooper:** are

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, like, how perfect. It's a bunch of just like knuckleheads who want to just slay dragons and they can just get paid to do it. So, that makes sense. If Aldora can build a fake moon, they can pay a couple of

**Christopher Hooper:** And I don't know if you've heard the news, but there are dragons coming. And I believe Noraxis is coming. So, we should decide whether we want the big space gun to shoot

**Walden Briarhelm:** mercenaries.

**Christopher Hooper:** Noraxis or we want to take down the space gun. and help

**Ellis Taylor:** We definitely don't want to help him. He is not a good dude. I'm not convinced the space gun's going to

**Christopher Hooper:** Norases.

**Ellis Taylor:** really hurt him. But like

**Tyram:** Isn't Noraxis

**Ellis Taylor:** what about nice dragons? Like big old

**Tyram:** a nice dragon? The

**Ellis Taylor:** dragons. Oh, is he a nice dragon? Is he the bad? I don't know their

**Tyram:** bad dragon is Astro. I think the good dragon

**Ellis Taylor:** names. Okay. Oh, yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** No, we want the we want the nice dragon to be

**Walden Briarhelm:** the

**Christopher Hooper:** I you you followed tear

**Tyram:** is

**Christopher Hooper:** right I

**Ellis Taylor:** fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** think good to think of them as uh two sides of a scale.

**Tyram:** Wonderful.

**Christopher Hooper:** Noraxis is fiery hot

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh

**Christopher Hooper:** explosive. Astro is the void

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** endless. Everything ends in the void. That is their aim. But in balance we have

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. So, you're saying we shouldn't kill

**Christopher Hooper:** life or

**Ellis Taylor:** either of them, but we got to figure out how to make

**Christopher Hooper:** both.

**Ellis Taylor:** them or both. Yeah. And then hopefully we don't all die. Yeah. We don't do something we should have. We shouldn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** Do we does any feel uh

**Ellis Taylor:** have.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I'm wondering if anybody in the group would know through passing or through having seen it in like the old vault rooms if these other orbs are as you or as Bafel implied they're like all parts of just Astro because there can that be rolled for or I'm trying to think if like I don't I think could potentially but the challenge would be extremely high. He was worried about moving the heavy stuff that or breaking those heavy stones.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Meanwhile, other people were in the room and could see the map with like where the orb locations were. I'm wondering if that's a

**Christopher Hooper:** any anyone um I would say you you have like fairly complete knowledge. there was only one stone on that map and it seems like they might have

**Walden Briarhelm:** possibility.

**Christopher Hooper:** not known about all of them or maybe there are new ones. Who knows? Um, and I think I would make you roll, but I think both of those ideas are are pretty equal weight as far as like they could be separate or they could be uh like shards of a single, right? Or like split from a single

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Got it.

**Christopher Hooper:** entity.

**Walden Briarhelm:** But to Olivia, Ma would say, "While I do happen to agree that the space laser may not work, that same space laser was what took down the Luna, so it is capable of taking down a

**Ellis Taylor:** Luna's not dead.

**Walden Briarhelm:** god."

**Ellis Taylor:** Unclear, I guess, cuz she she fell she fell out of the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, they were able to out of the

**Ellis Taylor:** sky, but she landed in this special squishy place. So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** sky.

**Ellis Taylor:** she's not dead. And she landed in a squishy space so the leader didn't kill

**Christopher Hooper:** It is hard to kill a god. It is

**Walden Briarhelm:** just took

**Ellis Taylor:** her. How pissed is

**Christopher Hooper:** true.

**Ellis Taylor:** Dragon going to be when he finds out his girlfriend got

**Christopher Hooper:** I think I think very

**Ellis Taylor:** shot? Pocket that went away from

**Walden Briarhelm:** over. Now

**Ellis Taylor:** when we inevitably have the conversation and could point him to where who we wanted to

**Christopher Hooper:** mad.

**Ellis Taylor:** kill.

**Walden Briarhelm:** you Now that spots

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. I'm glad we had this conversation. I am

**Ellis Taylor:** Are

**Christopher Hooper:** equally confused. And I was hoping you had

**Tyram:** Okay, as far as I'm aware,

**Christopher Hooper:** uh a

**Tyram:** maybe has like some sort of play and with Luna everything, we have never had any sort of ambition when it comes to this godly conflict. As far as I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** you

**Tyram:** aware, I do not think that it has ever been on our to-do

**Christopher Hooper:** plan.

**Tyram:** list to like stop this war of the gods. We hate Elderan and we oppose them where we can. I do not think we have ever committed ourselves to this conflict between dragons and uh and uh the elder. Apparently, you want us to pick a

**Christopher Hooper:** I think that is the problem.

**Ellis Taylor:** I thought we were just trying to keep Just

**Christopher Hooper:** I mean if you can fight everyone if you

**Tyram:** side. I don't think we can beat any of them, let alone all of

**Christopher Hooper:** want Okay. You hold a lot of power

**Ellis Taylor:** I thought we were

**Tyram:** them.

**Christopher Hooper:** even in your

**Ellis Taylor:** trying to keep the I thought the whole reason we were coming here was the orb

**Tyram:** So

**Ellis Taylor:** and trying to keep that boy to dragon

**Tyram:** yeah, apparently I was I thought it was a more straightforward thing to do to reseal this dragon god. I thought that was unambiguously a bad thing, the dragon getting out, but

**Christopher Hooper:** backpack.

**Tyram:** apparently Raphael wants us to

**Ellis Taylor:** side question.

**Tyram:** reconsider. I don't

**Ellis Taylor:** How long's he been in

**Walden Briarhelm:** I don't

**Tyram:** know.

**Ellis Taylor:** there? I mean, if it's like a f****** long ass time, we've been fine for a f****** long ass

**Walden Briarhelm:** think we know.

**Tyram:** I've had the orb for like a couple of years now if

**Christopher Hooper:** There

**Ellis Taylor:** time. Let's just keep him in there. I mean, but like who put them in like these ancient ass people put them in there? We've been fine for

**Tyram:** so I don't know. I

**Christopher Hooper:** we could be fine. You could I feel like maybe you could thread the needle too. Maybe you maybe you use the elder ends to kill the dragons and then and then you take

**Ellis Taylor:** generations.

**Christopher Hooper:** them out, I

**Ellis Taylor:** Or we just stage it so that the elderans and dragons all just kill each other and we'll just sit back

**Tyram:** mean,

**Christopher Hooper:** guess. Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Mhm. Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** I hope you have a very good underground

**Ellis Taylor:** watch. I hope so. Well, I did until my city got

**Christopher Hooper:** bunker. Oh

**Ellis Taylor:** destroyed.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, maybe it's time to build a new underground

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yep.

**Christopher Hooper:** city. Okay, new plan. Underground

**Ellis Taylor:** I like where your head's

**Christopher Hooper:** city.

**Ellis Taylor:** at.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So, the plan is continue the ritual and you want to uh do something to the the

**Tyram:** Well, yeah, they're going to use some sort of equipment, right, to try to track the other orbs.

**Christopher Hooper:** beacons. Yes, I have information for

**Tyram:** So, okay, if we do sabotage that, I feel like at the

**Christopher Hooper:** you. All

**Tyram:** very least that's setting back both groups because at

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I was about to say, how are

**Tyram:** least I don't I don't care about finding them.

**Ellis Taylor:** we supposed to find

**Tyram:** Or do we want to find them? Okay,

**Ellis Taylor:** them? Yes.

**Tyram:** nerds. Instead of I guess straight up sabotaging it, could you steal their uh the info from them and keep them from getting it? I

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah,

**Tyram:** will. Okay. I

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** Rogue, could

**Tyram:** can't steal data. I We need nerds for that. This is

**Justin Hale:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** a nerd

**Christopher Hooper:** This

**Ellis Taylor:** we? Oh, I was thinking of swiping a piece of

**Tyram:** operation. Is there a piece of paper? I'll go steal the piece of paper. I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** is

**Ellis Taylor:** paper, but

**Tyram:** know how this

**Ali Leonard:** Like, yeah. You want us to steal the print out or like what are we

**Ellis Taylor:** sure.

**Tyram:** works. I don't know. Like, can you like redirect the signal to something you

**Ali Leonard:** doing

**Tyram:** can read and that they can't? I don't know.

**Christopher Hooper:** perfect.

**Ellis Taylor:** Pages go like click clack clack click

**Tyram:** Yeah, like I don't know how nerd s***

**Ellis Taylor:** clack on your special little gadgets and there's like vertical green text and you're like click

**Ali Leonard:** here? I mean, I'm not a coder. I

**Ellis Taylor:** click clack clack clack and you get all the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, like if only we had

**Tyram:** work. We have two

**Walden Briarhelm:** an artifiser who could come up with some sort of gadget, right? And what if they came up with a gadget that could just like transmit the

**Ellis Taylor:** stuff okay so I got it I got it we'll

**Walden Briarhelm:** right signal to us, the wrong

**Christopher Hooper:** Did

**Ali Leonard:** don't

**Ellis Taylor:** We'll get we'll sneeze and we'll get a virus and I'll sneeze it and I'll put it on a piece of paper on a little disc and we'll put it inside the computer.

**Tyram:** Okay. So, if we could do that, that'd be

**Walden Briarhelm:** signal?

**Justin Hale:** All

**Tyram:** a good way to really kick this can down the road a little bit because then

**Christopher Hooper:** you?

**Tyram:** the dragons would be set back because we resealed the orb and the elder ants would not advance because they want to get the information they want. Neither faction

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** is better off. And so at the very least, we

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** have not made either side better

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, I like that. f***


### [01:00:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** What do you do? Artifisters, do you think you have the skills to make something to do

**Christopher Hooper:** Let

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Alderan.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah, I guess I come up with a bomb to do

**Ali Leonard:** See, that's the thing. Our expertise is really in cars and

**Walden Briarhelm:** this?

**Tyram:** off.

**Christopher Hooper:** me

**Ali Leonard:** bomb. So, I can think real

**Justin Hale:** that.

**Tyram:** Hey, I mean, I'm

**Ali Leonard:** I can squint my eyes and think real hard and see if I can come up with

**Tyram:** gonna be honest. I was really banking on you guys having a solution

**Ali Leonard:** something.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh,

**Ali Leonard:** Can I roll for smarts to see if I can figure something out

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** Well,

**Ali Leonard:** on how to sabotage it, but also get the

**Walden Briarhelm:** hey.

**Christopher Hooper:** let me first tell you the

**Ellis Taylor:** like like intercept the signal or something like one one team

**Tyram:** here.

**Ellis Taylor:** sabotages but the other team intercepts the signal so we like get the data

**Ali Leonard:** information? We give them the wrong

**Ellis Taylor:** but then like f****** their machinery so they don't get the they can't

**Tyram:** I mean, Olivia laid out the path.

**Ali Leonard:** data, but we take the right

**Ellis Taylor:** like Yeah, something like

**Tyram:** Didn't you hear about all the clicketity

**Christopher Hooper:** setup. And then she put a

**Ali Leonard:** data. Yeah. If I click clack a

**Ellis Taylor:** that.

**Tyram:** clack?

**Christopher Hooper:** virus on the CD.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. And we can create a virus. I mean, I'm kind of I'm a little under the

**Tyram:** Hey, if Jeff Goldlum can upgrade

**Ellis Taylor:** weather, so I mean, I feel like I could come up with

**Tyram:** a virus from his f****** 1990s uh laptop and destroy an interstellar invasion force of aliens, this should totally be

**Ali Leonard:** lot. So, what do I have to roll for

**Christopher Hooper:** Let me tell you what

**Ali Leonard:** that?

**Justin Hale:** Put a stroll

**Christopher Hooper:** exists first and then we'll move from there.

**Ellis Taylor:** something. a

**Tyram:** possible.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So,

**Ellis Taylor:** brainstorming

**Justin Hale:** together. What exists first? The chicken.

**Ali Leonard:** Both.

**Ellis Taylor:** role. Oh

**Justin Hale:** No, the egg. No, no, no. The chicken.

**Christopher Hooper:** Many histories

**Ali Leonard:** Both same

**Ellis Taylor:** no.

**Christopher Hooper:** describe a dragon species that mutated over thousands of years, eventually becoming a

**Ali Leonard:** time. That doesn't

**Ellis Taylor:** Both. That sounds

**Christopher Hooper:** chicken. Oh, but I'm getting distracted.

**Ali Leonard:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** nice.

**Christopher Hooper:** So the crash site itself has three sensors around it but each of the boats has a relay to read the

**Ali Leonard:** I am

**Christopher Hooper:** sensors. Originally when we set up this expedition we did

**Ali Leonard:** a This

**Christopher Hooper:** not think we would have rang. So we were hoping to set up some sort of explosion energy something to ignite the site and send out the energy but that it was very low likelihood. mainly I was using it the ruse to see the crashing

**Ali Leonard:** was

**Christopher Hooper:** but since we can actually do the rebinding ritual I think that makes sense and the sensors will definitely work but there may be other boats with other relays this is the problem I think there on this boat is a relay you can try to sneak to get it or as I mentioned earlier, if we want this boat, we can buy it and everyone on it, which was what I was

**Ali Leonard:** kind of saying

**Christopher Hooper:** uh

**Ali Leonard:** earlier. Yeah. Circling back.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. So, there is a room. It's in the captain's quarters where we have set up the relay.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um but depending on your

**Tyram:** There we

**Christopher Hooper:** approach you will take different uh options. What do you

**Tyram:** go.

**Ali Leonard:** Okay. So, either sneak or buy

**Ellis Taylor:** Hi, we don't got the money to

**Tyram:** I mean, yeah, you got a bunch of gold there. Money

**Christopher Hooper:** think?

**Ellis Taylor:** buy

**Walden Briarhelm:** And we got to sneak.

**Tyram:** bags. We don't have that. No, I meant Rafael. He's like, "Oh, just buy them off. Buy them all."

**Ali Leonard:** me. I just always give my gold to Silus. I don't have any

**Ellis Taylor:** All right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Is this where like shows up and he's like, "Hey boss, I got a

**Tyram:** Jeez. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** He he shows up and

**Ali Leonard:** gold.

**Walden Briarhelm:** whole

**Tyram:** So,

**Christopher Hooper:** he's like, "I've got two

**Tyram:** above table talk. Um I think after we went to the dragon horde at High Forge, we should have like 20,000 gold for party loot. Um like

**Christopher Hooper:** cantalopes.

**Tyram:** everybody took like a thousand of it, I think, and bought s***. But

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh yeah, we do have

**Tyram:** then I thought it was like I think it was we had got

**Ellis Taylor:** 25k in the party inventory.

**Tyram:** a total of 26. I think we said everybody in the party can take a thousand and then we had 20,000 left over just for like party uh like I think that was supposed to be for like building the pocket village and s*** like

**Ellis Taylor:** I really like the idea of sneaking into the relay,

**Tyram:** that. I love that

**Ellis Taylor:** getting the information, then sending the incorrect information

**Tyram:** idea.

**Ali Leonard:** send me upload information into the relay or are there

**Ellis Taylor:** out.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Perfect.

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ali Leonard:** relays just receivers? You know what I

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. Do

**Tyram:** I feel like that's a

**Christopher Hooper:** Go

**Ali Leonard:** mean? But

**Ellis Taylor:** an artificer check. Smarty

**Tyram:** good way like I feel like we can all be involved because like

**Ali Leonard:** I just sneak in. I would have to sneak into the relay

**Tyram:** I can do the sneaky stuff. We just need you to do the nerd

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Ali Leonard:** room.

**Ellis Taylor:** pants. Oh, no. No, no. We've got a bag.

**Tyram:** s***. I can

**Ali Leonard:** I'll do the m s***, but I can't

**Ellis Taylor:** We've got a

**Walden Briarhelm:** You know,

**Ellis Taylor:** bag. We've got a bag of holding.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it sounds like we need a distraction. Do you think

**Tyram:** sneak.

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, the distraction is most of us doing the orb thing and

**Tyram:** I feel like we should set

**Ali Leonard:** sneak.

**Ellis Taylor:** then the other half of the party sneaking and dealing with the

**Tyram:** the sabotage before we do the

**Ellis Taylor:** sensors. You think

**Tyram:** ritual. Well, if that's

**Ali Leonard:** like prep it, I

**Ellis Taylor:** so? Do you think? Well, I guess that's up to the artificial. Can they do it remotely or set

**Tyram:** possible, yes, I'd like to do

**Ellis Taylor:** it? Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** How far away are we from the ritual

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's still pretty

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. 20 minutes. Let's

**Christopher Hooper:** far. You've got You've got

**Walden Briarhelm:** site? It's

**Christopher Hooper:** time.

**Ali Leonard:** guess.

**Ellis Taylor:** go.

**Walden Briarhelm:** over. We have time. I I think Ma should uh put on his Ninja Turtle disguise and walk out onto the uh the ship like top deck and just start boasting about nobody's here is good enough to beat him in arm wrestling which will draw everybody over.

**Christopher Hooper:** All right. All

**Walden Briarhelm:** You guys can sneak off and do your thing.

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm gonna go up there and join you and also and challenge you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Even Even Brew

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Oh. All right. All

**Ali Leonard:** Sure.

**Ellis Taylor:** as part of the

**Walden Briarhelm:** can. Oh, yes. The first The first one is the lady who's got the muscle mommy. Look. This is

**Christopher Hooper:** right.

**Ellis Taylor:** demonstration. Granny mommy, come on. Muscle

**Walden Briarhelm:** great. Oh, sorry. Yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Ellis Taylor:** grandma. Grandommy. Yeah, muscle grandmommy.

**Tyram:** Muscle granny.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay so I

**Justin Hale:** Grand

**Christopher Hooper:** think I think for

**Ali Leonard:** for

**Ellis Taylor:** Grand Mommy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Great.

**Christopher Hooper:** this we are going to do what's called a tag team and daggerheart where you are both going to do a performance check and you can take the best one and we'll use that to affect the DC of our spy

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** crew.

**Ali Leonard:** mommy.

**Tyram:** Heat.

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool. Explain that again. I was looking at muscle grandmom pictures

**Tyram:** At least you're using the time

**Ellis Taylor:** and I didn't find a good enough

**Christopher Hooper:** focus.

**Walden Briarhelm:** You're going to share,

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you're both gonna you're both going to roll

**Ellis Taylor:** one. I didn't find one I

**Walden Briarhelm:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** a performance check um or

**Ellis Taylor:** liked. Okay. And a

**Christopher Hooper:** athletics.

**Ellis Taylor:** strength.

**Tyram:** well.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and You'll take the best of

**Ellis Taylor:** Definitely going to be

**Christopher Hooper:** uh which uh of the roles the both of you

**Walden Briarhelm:** So was I'm sorry I kept getting cut outs. It's performance

**Christopher Hooper:** do?

**Walden Briarhelm:** or the whole world.

**Ellis Taylor:** athletics. Should I get my new dice? I bought I got the honest dice. Did you guys see their

**Christopher Hooper:** Athletics. Are they like perfectly balanced or

**Ellis Taylor:** Kickstarter? It's an actually mathematically

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** something? Nice.

**Ellis Taylor:** balance. Yeah. Like instead of one being on the other side of 20, it's actually 19 is on the opposite side. It's like mathematically more balanced.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, nice. Only

**Christopher Hooper:** first

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, cuz it's first roll. I'm so

**Walden Briarhelm:** rolls 20s.

**Christopher Hooper:** roll. Here we

**Ali Leonard:** It

**Ellis Taylor:** nervous. It's not too bad.

**Christopher Hooper:** go. 18 uh on the on the

**Ali Leonard:** doesn't matter at

**Ellis Taylor:** 18. Yeah. Oh, no. Sorry.

**Justin Hale:** Right.

**Christopher Hooper:** dice. Oh, okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, 18 total. 18 plus my

**Walden Briarhelm:** I only got a 25 in

**Justin Hale:** Did you buy the whole set of

**Ellis Taylor:** eight of what? No, I

**Walden Briarhelm:** athletics.

**Justin Hale:** these of the honest

**Ali Leonard:** all.

**Ellis Taylor:** just did the Kickstarter for the D20. Oh, but wait, I can

**Justin Hale:** dice? Oh, okay. I was going to say the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** do No, no, no, no, no. I I did not

**Justin Hale:** whole

**Tyram:** $75 for a f****** set of

**Ali Leonard:** 2. How

**Ellis Taylor:** spend that. No, no, no, no,

**Tyram:** dice. It was

**Ali Leonard:** much?

**Ellis Taylor:** no.

**Justin Hale:** $275$275 for

**Tyram:** 70. I was already thinking that was outrageous at 75.

**Christopher Hooper:** expensive.

**Justin Hale:** a bro. Hey,

**Tyram:** Wow.

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I

**Justin Hale:** but but it's discounted

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, those are the titanium

**Ali Leonard:** 275. Oh my god.

**Ellis Taylor:** spent Yeah. No, this is I'll look up what was on the Kickstarter. It was not that. There's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Are these made

**Justin Hale:** $400.

**Ellis Taylor:** my lucky. You can

**Walden Briarhelm:** of? What are these made

**Justin Hale:** Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** ones.

**Ellis Taylor:** get them at different stuff.

**Walden Briarhelm:** of

**Justin Hale:** there's the titanium

**Walden Briarhelm:** aluminum?

**Justin Hale:** ones 70 marked down to

**Christopher Hooper:** Honest.

**Ellis Taylor:** honesty. So for if I need to, I can use a lucky

**Justin Hale:** 449. That's

**Ellis Taylor:** point and make that and do roll again. But I think between an 18

**Walden Briarhelm:** Honest.

**Christopher Hooper:** I think it's going to be

**Ellis Taylor:** and a 25, we're okay right

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Um, so with

**Ellis Taylor:** now. Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** crazy.


### [01:10:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** that, um, we will set, uh, so we'll set we'll go ahead. I honestly don't think Silus can can fail this check. Uh but your stealth check is going to be like I don't know a 15 gets you in the room uh pretty easily. A 20 gets you in the room like as a ghost. Um without any like like it it def it like exudes that nothing is going on here. Um and 25 is like uh you are also able to cover for any like loud

**Tyram:** Oh, sick.

**Christopher Hooper:** noises and failures that might be coming in the

**Ali Leonard:** I don't know what you're talking

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, yeah. I only spent I only gave them 30

**Tyram:** Okay, that's much better.

**Christopher Hooper:** room.

**Ali Leonard:** about.

**Ellis Taylor:** bucks. Yeah. No,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Is it resin the one you got or is

**Christopher Hooper:** Good titanium or aluminum

**Ellis Taylor:** it's metal.

**Walden Briarhelm:** it

**Christopher Hooper:** probably. Is it

**Ellis Taylor:** I don't know. It's metal. I can look. I'm going to look. That's actually I've got a magnet right

**Walden Briarhelm:** cool?

**Christopher Hooper:** magnetic? All right, then. That doesn't answer

**Ellis Taylor:** here.

**Tyram:** Yeah. Okay. So, now

**Ellis Taylor:** No. Either of those. Hold on. I can

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait, wait, wait. You don't know

**Tyram:** we can narrow it down to who we already had it narrowed down to.

**Ellis Taylor:** check. It's aluminum. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** either. Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** aluminum. Yeah. It's

**Tyram:** Okay. So, you want me to roll

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** like

**Tyram:** still? All

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, I assume they're pumping into the

**Walden Briarhelm:** how

**Tyram:** right. Yeah. Okay,

**Christopher Hooper:** the portable hole. It's

**Tyram:** guys. Get in the pee hole. Bruce said he watched

**Ali Leonard:** It has been washed,

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. I cleaned it

**Tyram:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** right? Because you didn't wash it

**Justin Hale:** up. It still smells a little bit, but like I washed it

**Ali Leonard:** and I know you didn't. What' you wash it

**Walden Briarhelm:** The pee hole always

**Justin Hale:** out. I did wash

**Christopher Hooper:** okay.

**Ali Leonard:** with? That's what I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** Let's stay tight.

**Walden Briarhelm:** does a

**Justin Hale:** it or

**Ali Leonard:** saying. You need to watch him. You have him watch the bee hole and then he washes it with more

**Justin Hale:** pee. It doesn't smell like old anymore.

**Tyram:** Well,

**Ali Leonard:** pee. I

**Walden Briarhelm:** little.

**Justin Hale:** It smells like new pee. It doesn't smell like old pee

**Tyram:** I'm glad I'm not going to the pee

**Ali Leonard:** would rather die.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, Ally, something very important you did miss

**Justin Hale:** anymore.

**Tyram:** hole.

**Ali Leonard:** Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** is Brew is canonically colorb blind

**Justin Hale:** Oh

**Tyram:** Oh yeah, that was a

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** now. That's very

**Walden Briarhelm:** And it's like

**Tyram:** thing. Yeah, you were some

**Ellis Taylor:** important.

**Walden Briarhelm:** blue purple or what was

**Justin Hale:** yeah,

**Tyram:** weird version. It wasn't red green. It was some weird version of color blind that I don't think I've ever heard

**Walden Briarhelm:** it?

**Justin Hale:** it's

**Tyram:** before. Oh, my

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** No, no, no. It's it's deranopia. It's the most common one, but it's

**Ali Leonard:** good.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Brown.

**Justin Hale:** basically so duranopia you can basically see blue and no

**Tyram:** mistake.

**Ellis Taylor:** So you should never What do

**Justin Hale:** other colors like everything else is like a shade like brownish.

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, they're

**Ellis Taylor:** you inside of your bombs look like? Like the red wire is never the

**Ali Leonard:** like he's like, "Cut the blue

**Ellis Taylor:** right one. They're all

**Justin Hale:** Also, historically, it

**Tyram:** I got to

**Ellis Taylor:** red.

**Justin Hale:** fits because everything that Brew made was blue and

**Tyram:** add 27 on stealth though.

**Christopher Hooper:** a 27. Okay, great. Um, with that

**Ali Leonard:** wire.

**Walden Briarhelm:** The door opens for

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** 27, uh, you

**Justin Hale:** yellow

**Christopher Hooper:** both, uh, we're going to do a group check, uh, with Brew and Ellmith. Arana check on this relay. You see it, uh, in the captain's quarters. Um, very simple. There's just this antenna with this like revolving um uh we recognize it as like a it's like a a dish with it's like a satellite dish looking thing with a little what is that called? Um where you have the

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** dish and the signal like sticking out from it.

**Justin Hale:** the Yeah, the little receiver

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Um so that's just like revolving like spinning around. Um and it's at the base of it there is like a console.

**Justin Hale:** sim

**Christopher Hooper:** Um it is uh you

**Ali Leonard:** over.

**Christopher Hooper:** know the the technology era is like uh 1960s. So think that um uh type of uh type of wiring and stuff going on.

**Justin Hale:** So the so the satellite dish is

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. Highly experienced

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, it's small enough to fit in a room. Yeah, but it's pretty

**Justin Hale:** gigantic.

**Christopher Hooper:** big. Um, and yeah, if I can

**Ali Leonard:** man.

**Christopher Hooper:** get a a group arpon check uh from the two of you. Um, do you want me to tell

**Tyram:** Liliana gave them bartic

**Christopher Hooper:** you? Do you want me to tell you?

**Ali Leonard:** 19 for

**Justin Hale:** Army uh 16 for

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. And because of that 27

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** from from Silus, uh you get one more

**Ali Leonard:** me.

**Tyram:** inspiration.

**Ali Leonard:** I think he's saying that

**Justin Hale:** Oh, that means we

**Tyram:** Would it be fair

**Ali Leonard:** we need one more

**Tyram:** to say that Lyanna gives

**Christopher Hooper:** try. Uh

**Ellis Taylor:** Liliana is there

**Christopher Hooper:** we're not gonna we're not going to say that. We're just going to include who's

**Ellis Taylor:** being like Go go go.

**Christopher Hooper:** here.

**Justin Hale:** did. Hold on. Hold on. Now you're freaking me out. Uh what is my flash of genius

**Tyram:** inspiration?

**Ali Leonard:** try.

**Justin Hale:** plus fork? Uh so that's going to be

**Christopher Hooper:** total.

**Ali Leonard:** I had

**Justin Hale:** 25 total for

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** me. 25 total for

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. So that takes you group check above

**Justin Hale:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** 20. I will give you the DCs here. DC10 was you would figure out how the relay

**Justin Hale:** 20

**Christopher Hooper:** worked and realize you don't have the skills to sabotage it. Uh less than that you would have

**Ali Leonard:** 20. Damn.

**Christopher Hooper:** f***** it up. DC-15 would be that you can hijack the sign uh you can hijack the signal uh but you won't be able to sabotage it. The DC20 was to be able to hijack it and also be able to sabotage the relay network where only you will be able to get the signal. All right. So you're able you're able to work through uh the

**Ellis Taylor:** Cool. We did it.

**Christopher Hooper:** network uh through the console. you see that they're they're you're able to work where it will send erroneous uh signals to the other relays um and store

**Justin Hale:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** them um while saving a local uh instance of the actual coordinates of the other orbs here. Um all you will need to do is return to the ship to get them. Um cool. So, uh, what did they hear up up on the deck? Uh, uh, and, um, retired detective Olivia

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'll let

**Ellis Taylor:** I think they hear a lot of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Olivia Cooper go first here.

**Ellis Taylor:** people just like chanting like go go go go and

**Christopher Hooper:** Cooper.

**Ellis Taylor:** we're just like like full on like both trying to like trying to beat each other but also So trying to like ham it up so that that we keep

**Christopher Hooper:** Put

**Ellis Taylor:** their attention. I feel like but on a bit of a show but also like we're like I'm stronger.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, uh, yeah, definitely. I, uh, I'd like to imagine before we started, I had taken a second to show off the belt that I have

**Christopher Hooper:** another

**Walden Briarhelm:** on, which is the, uh, belt of bear, the strongest man of Silsbury. It's a legendary, wondrous item that I have equipped. the felt of uh is it mountain giant strength or something like that and uh like you know because I'm in my wrestling persona really like oh yeah and uh uh I think what would be the thing that I would want to stand out as you can

**Christopher Hooper:** Ah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** see like even though I'm a to starting to like visually sweat because this gr muscle granny is keeping up

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Walden Briarhelm:** and uh we're putting on a hell of a show this crowd is rolling It's not as loud as the main floor of the uh the dragon's hide, but it is stomping very

**Christopher Hooper:** you hear a rockus like there's betting going on around you as both sides as the as the bout goes on. Um but I believe Elizabeth or uh Olivia your athletics total was 18. Is that right? Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, he's going to beat

**Walden Briarhelm:** similar.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, Ma has the beating of you after a tense uh

**Ellis Taylor:** me.

**Christopher Hooper:** bout uh that seems to go on way too long back and forth. Uh Ma decides to put an end to this and slams home the win uh and uh uh is victorious. Um there's a huge cheer and jeers and booze and uh various uh money exchanged as the the bets are resolved. Um and uh soon I imagine um you see your uh fellow party members go back above deck uh seemingly unnoticed and uh join in the fun. Um the rest of the evening um is spent aboard. Uh and uh the captain at one point announces we'll make the sight in the morning. Uh get your rest and drink up. It's on St. George. Uh and at this point there's a huge cheer. Yeah. and they start opening casts of ale um that were uh put on board earlier.

**Tyram:** Oh god, we need to

**Christopher Hooper:** And there's a rockus party going on on the ship

**Tyram:** get below decks before nightfalls. Well,

**Christopher Hooper:** as

**Tyram:** I didn't make up their routine. We all know what it is, though.

**Justin Hale:** Gross. It's disgusting.


### [01:20:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** um All right. Uh, anything anyone wants to do overnight before we hit in the morning where we arrive to the crash

**Walden Briarhelm:** I uh Olivia I'd like to imagine and Olivia actually had a a moment last time where uh before a bed ceremony, we were both kind of

**Christopher Hooper:** site?

**Walden Briarhelm:** doing a uh I was doing Tai Chi and uh I think that she joined as she was stretching. Uh I'd like to invite Olivia to join with Ma and Bafel to do a similar Tai Chi like experience in like

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, she'd love

**Walden Briarhelm:** their evening

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, do you work out in the mornings too? It is a

**Walden Briarhelm:** time.

**Christopher Hooper:** great

**Ellis Taylor:** to. Oh, yes, honey. I'm not not quite as as in the Zen situation, but the meditation is a great break up for my normal normal kind of like lifting

**Christopher Hooper:** practice.

**Ellis Taylor:** routine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I will be honest, Buffy. The first time that I had to go train one after joining this party, Olivia was actually awake before me. She

**Christopher Hooper:** Wow. You must wake

**Walden Briarhelm:** is very dedicated.

**Christopher Hooper:** with the

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, are we I'm like imagining some sort of like on the deck the sun is not even visible yet, but the sun is starting to light up in the

**Christopher Hooper:** birds.

**Walden Briarhelm:** horizon and there's just like two turtles and this

**Ellis Taylor:** Are you

**Walden Briarhelm:** beefy ass granny just doing like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** cheating?

**Walden Briarhelm:** slow Yeah. Oh, yeah. The

**Christopher Hooper:** Sun sunrise coming over the the water's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we do

**Walden Briarhelm:** water is

**Ellis Taylor:** the the like foot swap in silhouette al

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** edge. Uhhuh. I think we

**Ellis Taylor:** together.

**Walden Briarhelm:** yes, there's some coordination for sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** have an anime moment where even though we're doing Tai Chi, there's like and like air shimmering around us with like immense power sort of thing going

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, one of the times we all bring our hands up at the same time and a huge

**Christopher Hooper:** on. Uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** wave crashes. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Straight out of water bending. What's everybody else up

**Christopher Hooper:** exactly. probably f****** asleep at this time of

**Tyram:** Yeah, for your early morning routine, Tyl is

**Christopher Hooper:** day,

**Ellis Taylor:** yeah.

**Tyram:** definitely f full on

**Christopher Hooper:** but um cool. Uh any anything anyone else wants to do before getting to the car

**Tyram:** asleep.

**Christopher Hooper:** site? Cool. All right. Um, you are sailing along in the morning and

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** it's pretty early. Uh, at one point the caller says out says, "Hi, the crash site. It's almost air." And you see people scurrying to um the front of the boat. As you make your way, you begin to see this border where the the sea ends. Um, and you can make out a like open ring. Um, at a certain point you see some murmur like a worle, something like that. Uh, but then you see it's a sheer drop. You can see the other side of this ring. Um, and it is perfectly dry and you can start to see the ocean floor uh within this ring of of ocean like hundreds of feet below. And as you get closer, you can start to see over the sides of the boat. You see down swirling vortex has a very stark um wall and you measure probably 300 ft below is a dry ocean floor. And on that floor uh well um you want to see what you see on the ocean floor. All right. Hopefully I

**Tyram:** The Toeer had no followup to

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** that. He just wanted to ask to see if we wanted to see

**Christopher Hooper:** can

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, it's like Oh, wait.

**Christopher Hooper:** Well, tough s***.

**Ellis Taylor:** s***. This picture real quick.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, can you see

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, muscle

**Tyram:** it. Now we

**Christopher Hooper:** that?

**Ellis Taylor:** granny.

**Tyram:** can.

**Christopher Hooper:** So you start seeing

**Ellis Taylor:** Yes.

**Tyram:** Oh

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Oh, she is dead maybe.

**Christopher Hooper:** um um there

**Justin Hale:** or she land

**Christopher Hooper:** is she land the

**Justin Hale:** a cushiony

**Tyram:** sick.

**Christopher Hooper:** cushion. What about the cushion?

**Tyram:** Those those aren't rocks. Those are all just like really big bean

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and you see the

**Justin Hale:** place.

**Tyram:** bags.

**Christopher Hooper:** skeleton uh of a glowing winged figure. Uh, she appears to be about 400 uh feet long.

**Justin Hale:** That's very

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Justin Hale:** tall.

**Christopher Hooper:** is and uh you um you uh kind of shore up um right on the edge of the ocean uh right along the side. Um and there it is. At this point, uh you see um the anchors being dropped. Uh and um they're trying not to fall over the side of the ocean and uh you see that there are um repelling uh anchors being set uh that can take. But um at this point Bafael approaches says hello. Um it is time. And at that point he jumps over the side of the ship into the water and you see him kind of go in and out between the water and the air and he descends rapidly but catches himself in the water and then disappears. And then you see him walk um along the dry ocean floor at the

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, I'm not going down that way.

**Tyram:** Is it worth burning one of my limited use teleportations for this? No, probably not,

**Justin Hale:** I don't know. How much does uh a

**Tyram:** right? Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** bottom.

**Justin Hale:** goddess helmet sell for?

**Tyram:** s***. Wow. Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** Honey, that is way too big to be back. She's

**Tyram:** Well, okay, but like people would probably buy

**Ellis Taylor:** 400 ft

**Tyram:** like filings from a goddess bone,

**Ellis Taylor:** tall. Are you going to

**Tyram:** right? There's no one around us

**Ellis Taylor:** defile's

**Justin Hale:** Silus. Um, listen, I may not

**Tyram:** right

**Ellis Taylor:** god?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I would think they I would kind of hope you

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** would like Zack hack hopes that your characters would still like we we can't

**Tyram:** now.

**Walden Briarhelm:** pass this up. It goes against our religion

**Justin Hale:** be

**Tyram:** Yeah, Silas is very

**Walden Briarhelm:** to not do

**Tyram:** um non rel to be sure. So, he wouldn't really

**Ellis Taylor:** I wonder if there's a god of the the of

**Tyram:** care. There's got to be,

**Ellis Taylor:** thieves.

**Walden Briarhelm:** this.

**Justin Hale:** All

**Tyram:** right? Um, okay. So, I'm going to establish psychic phone with the party here. I'm going to exclude Ma for a second and like just directed at Brew and um Okay, so this is a me and Brew conversation. All right,

**Ellis Taylor:** Just see your way

**Tyram:** Brew. It It's Silus. Um, that was a good idea. We need to find a way to get

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Tyram:** ourselves a little bit of a, you know, essence of goddess Bone, you know, like that would you can put your hand down, but I feel like that would

**Ellis Taylor:** out.

**Tyram:** definitely sell her a lot.

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia's just like, "Yeah,

**Tyram:** This is

**Ellis Taylor:** guys, watching Ruby like this." Like, "Yeah, yeah, Tylus, I know what you're

**Tyram:** why This is why you don't put your hand up. It kind of You're

**Justin Hale:** What?

**Tyram:** kind of just defeating the purpose of trying to do this

**Ellis Taylor:** doing." I just walk over and like box both their ears and just lift them

**Tyram:** surreptitiously. Ow ow ow ow. What the

**Ellis Taylor:** up.

**Justin Hale:** But I'm Hey,

**Tyram:** hell? Oh, so hey, that

**Justin Hale:** I'm on the phone. I'm on the

**Tyram:** image on a Discord there, is that how jacked Olivia is.

**Christopher Hooper:** only when he's

**Ellis Taylor:** Sure, why

**Walden Briarhelm:** I hope

**Justin Hale:** phone. Sure, why not?

**Ellis Taylor:** not? Only was just flexing.

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Yeah. Um I I I feel like the headdress could fit

**Walden Briarhelm:** so.

**Justin Hale:** up there in the crow's nest. Like just set it on the top. It' be fine,

**Tyram:** Okay. That might be a little ambitious, Brew, but like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** people would probably like you could like get like a bottle of goddess bone powder and like

**Christopher Hooper:** flexing.

**Justin Hale:** right?

**Tyram:** put it in your bathtub, you know? That would that would there's a market for that. We should invent bath

**Christopher Hooper:** That's salt.

**Ellis Taylor:** Bath bombs. Are you going to invent bath

**Tyram:** bombs. Oh s***, that's perfect. Brew, you love

**Justin Hale:** Did you see

**Tyram:** making bombs. We'll make a bath bomb out of goddess bone

**Justin Hale:** that?

**Tyram:** powder, but like

**Ellis Taylor:** bombs?

**Justin Hale:** People hold. People want to put bombs in their bed.

**Tyram:** soothing exfoliating ones.

**Justin Hale:** Weird. Bombs aren't soothing

**Tyram:** That's why we're inventing

**Justin Hale:** or Well, they are a little Balms can be exfoliating in the sense that it will rip your skin off,

**Tyram:** it. Okay, we don't want that. Um, I feel like

**Justin Hale:** but the


### [01:30:00]

**Tyram:** the defining feature of a bomb is just like a like a like an outward thrust, right? You know, no one asked

**Justin Hale:** soothing. You're not

**Tyram:** you. It's the f******

**Christopher Hooper:** What?

**Justin Hale:** in this. Who is

**Christopher Hooper:** Sorry, this was before the wall. Don't mind

**Justin Hale:** this? All

**Tyram:** DM. It's the damn dream

**Christopher Hooper:** me. Oh no, not the dream

**Justin Hale:** right. All I know is I have enough bombs to blow up a piece of that headdress. And I'm going to get me a

**Tyram:** master. I mean, honestly, more power to you, man. That's We can definitely sell that, too.

**Justin Hale:** piece. I can blow up some of the bones, too, if you want me to. Easily. Easy

**Tyram:** Okay, let's let's roll back on the bath bomb thing. But like it could be like a like a

**Christopher Hooper:** master.

**Justin Hale:** peasy.

**Tyram:** bubble bath, you know, or like so some people pour in and like rub on their skin. People get like f****** like rhino bones and like tiger bones and s***. We could do it with goddess

**Justin Hale:** Why do people do this? It sounds

**Tyram:** bones. I don't know. I don't I don't say

**Ellis Taylor:** Now they're creating the wellness

**Tyram:** it's a good thing, but people do buy them, so you

**Ali Leonard:** They create group.

**Ellis Taylor:** industry. Oh my

**Justin Hale:** dumb.

**Tyram:** know. Oh man, that would be such a great endgame for

**Justin Hale:** I mean, I got a lot of

**Tyram:** Silus

**Ellis Taylor:** god. The ultimate grifter

**Justin Hale:** problems.

**Tyram:** creating. I mean, yeah. I mean, if I could just like that is like the ultimate scam

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey

**Tyram:** setup. I just have to like kind of reflavor it as like this newagy like uh like you know

**Christopher Hooper:** guys.

**Tyram:** positive vibes b*******.

**Christopher Hooper:** Are you going to

**Tyram:** Yeah. No.

**Christopher Hooper:** sell this as like um boner pills or something like

**Tyram:** No. I'm pictur like rub it on your skin and like it'll make you like

**Ellis Taylor:** goop.

**Tyram:** youthful or whatever type of

**Justin Hale:** Yeah. Swallow this bone.

**Tyram:** thing. We want to counterize. It's

**Christopher Hooper:** that? Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** It's going to be like radium and everyone's going

**Justin Hale:** It's a bone or

**Tyram:** not like we killed her, you know? We're just She's not

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** to

**Tyram:** using them

**Christopher Hooper:** harvesting her

**Tyram:** anymore. Is she alive or

**Justin Hale:** pill.

**Christopher Hooper:** body. Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** die.

**Christopher Hooper:** and uh, at this point like everyone's pretty familiar with like um, two people talking over telekinesis. So, everyone's just like waiting for you to finish your conversation.

**Tyram:** not?

**Justin Hale:** What? I'm on the phone.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, hey. Yeah. Um,

**Justin Hale:** Like just chill out. All right. I

**Christopher Hooper:** can I use a next? I need to call my

**Justin Hale:** guess I

**Christopher Hooper:** mom. Hey,

**Justin Hale:** mean All

**Tyram:** I'm very disappointed in you, son. Give the spoon back to

**Christopher Hooper:** mom. All right. Yeah, it was

**Justin Hale:** right.

**Christopher Hooper:** her.

**Justin Hale:** That was like

**Tyram:** Brew.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right. Uh, are y'all jumping off this

**Tyram:** Let's jump off this

**Ellis Taylor:** Hell

**Justin Hale:** her. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh Baf uh what Bafael did is an

**Christopher Hooper:** boat?

**Walden Briarhelm:** exact uh what did it's like we trained to do this

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, it's

**Walden Briarhelm:** exact movement. Uh I I don't

**Tyram:** boat.

**Christopher Hooper:** just

**Ellis Taylor:** no.

**Walden Briarhelm:** know what but like I I just felt necessary. I'm I'm drawn to the what looks to be remains of Luna and almost

**Christopher Hooper:** vertical. All right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** act without considering the

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and you do some some wave dashing, too. Stingray

**Walden Briarhelm:** party. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** style.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. Whatever cool s*** you got 360 noes or

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** something. Yes, for

**Justin Hale:** for Jesus.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, all right, everyone else. Uh, so

**Walden Briarhelm:** sure.

**Christopher Hooper:** Olivia is definitely not jumping off the ship. Um, she spends the rest of the session on the

**Ellis Taylor:** Hell

**Christopher Hooper:** ship. Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** no. I'm waiting to see if the soldiers guys have a better idea if they've got like a boat or

**Justin Hale:** You're such a

**Christopher Hooper:** okay. Are you are you jumping off,

**Ellis Taylor:** something.

**Justin Hale:** party,

**Christopher Hooper:** Brew? Okay, great.

**Justin Hale:** Peppa. Of course I am. I got stuff

**Walden Briarhelm:** Does he pull a parachute and an

**Justin Hale:** to blow

**Walden Briarhelm:** anvil falls out instead? Like

**Justin Hale:** up.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um uh he accidentally used a parachute from his anchor. Um you see the uh other sailors and soldiers. Um they are playing shuffle board on the on the deck. Uh they've laid out some sand. Um, and they're running some pucks along the board. Um, and uh, you just hear like a huge commotion. It's very competitive at this point. Uh, they're taking turns. Um, it looks like they've set up some kind of tournament. Um, and uh, it looks like there's roughly uh, five different sailor teams and then the the the three dragon knights.

**Ellis Taylor:** What the f***? You guys are just We're just doing Oh god.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Well, you're not coming with us. Okay. Liliana's

**Christopher Hooper:** Huh.

**Ellis Taylor:** Ding. Um, I guess Olivia's gonna look at El's and be like, "All right, let's at least get a life fast before we do this.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Um. All right. You grab a there's like two way fewer than you need for this type of boat. Um and they're they're pretty tattered, but you find them.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um it's by the one lifeboat. Um you you start clocking that if there's a disaster like you're going to be in a rough shape.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh

**Christopher Hooper:** Um and you grab that those those life vests jump off. Um, and let's say uh unless unless uh you specify otherwise, you

**Ellis Taylor:** no.

**Christopher Hooper:** start doing the same thing that Ma and Bafel are doing, which is like uh swapping between the water in the air as you like slow your fall to the ocean

**Ellis Taylor:** Definitely going to

**Christopher Hooper:** floor. Yeah. Um,

**Ellis Taylor:** try.

**Christopher Hooper:** and fortunately there are these ropes. Even if you um a few times you like don't quite get your movement right, but you're able to to catch yourself on the rope and push yourself back in the water. Um, yeah. And you all able to make it to the ocean floor just fine. You see, um, that and have started um, making their way uh, to the head uh to the head of this um fallen god, goddess, and you begin to you begin to hear this voice in your mind. It's a very soft, weak, fragile voice. Uh she says, "Who who is that? I'm so weak my bones feel like they might break." And Um, it sounds like someone uh near the end. Um, the volume seems to get stronger as you get closer to um her head. Um, and you see that this is also where uh the um ritual site is. You see that there are some podiums around. Uh spots appear for the salt. Um you see four uh pillars that hold uh spherical objects. Um and uh Bafel begins to point you through uh the ritual site. Okay. I have learned this through my studies. I brought this big sack of salt and you said you brought the spheres of our lessons from the ship. Let us arrange it now. We must all pour our blood into the bowl. And he points towards the center of this um area. Right into the center is this pedestal with this large ceramic bowl. He says we must give our blood freely and then it will start the

**Tyram:** Good or bad for Silus to be

**Christopher Hooper:** ritual. Um

**Tyram:** approaching the bones with a file?

**Christopher Hooper:** and um yeah. Yeah. Do

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia's definitely not letting you near

**Christopher Hooper:** you um you're walking along um do you try to file a

**Tyram:** No, we'll do the stinking world saving ritual first, I

**Christopher Hooper:** bounce?

**Ellis Taylor:** them. If she dies in the ritual, maybe you can try. You

**Tyram:** guess. Could all of us hear her voice

**Ellis Taylor:** can try. How about that? She's not dead yet. I mean, would Silus really

**Tyram:** or just the just the faithful here?

**Ellis Taylor:** go

**Tyram:** Could all of us hear her voice or just the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. Sorry. What's that?

**Tyram:** monks? Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** all of

**Ellis Taylor:** try? Yeah. Would Silus really try if

**Tyram:** Okay. Probably

**Ellis Taylor:** he hears her talking to

**Tyram:** not. I do have some moral scruples,

**Christopher Hooper:** you.

**Ellis Taylor:** him? Yeah.

**Tyram:** but like not when it comes to dead bodies. I will piler the f*** out of

**Christopher Hooper:** Um um here go

**Walden Briarhelm:** I I I have

**Tyram:** those.


### [01:40:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** a whole like lorish

**Christopher Hooper:** ahead. Okay.

**Walden Briarhelm:** RPG thing. Is giving blood typical of a not like dark ritual? I feel like anytime you do blood magic, blood donation, it kind of has a a negative

**Christopher Hooper:** Give

**Walden Briarhelm:** twist to it, but I could just be wrong and I don't want to

**Christopher Hooper:** me either an arcane or religion check. Your choice.

**Walden Briarhelm:** implement my foot in my mouth here. What was it? Arcane

**Christopher Hooper:** Arcane or

**Walden Briarhelm:** or religion? All right. Big money. Do I have inspiration? I have inspiration from last time. I got a

**Christopher Hooper:** religion the

**Walden Briarhelm:** 16.

**Christopher Hooper:** 16. Um you um from your studies um you commonly know blood magic to be

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** um unnatural. Uh usually usually magic that is um uh like apo apostatic like um against the will of most gods. Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** f***

**Christopher Hooper:** and and usually uh evoked to fight uh usually evoked by mortals in a

**Walden Briarhelm:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** resistance to the natural

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, this does stand out as suspicious to Ma that we would be making a blood donation for

**Christopher Hooper:** order. I guess to I guess it might ring stronger like what like what this was is that it

**Walden Briarhelm:** this.

**Christopher Hooper:** is a ritual u made by mortals to try to bind something that is immortal and godly in nature.

**Walden Briarhelm:** So blood

**Christopher Hooper:** And you have heard

**Walden Briarhelm:** is okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** of instances of necromancy and blood magic used in ways that

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** um were um ethically good um while being complicated from a religious and like natural standpoint.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, I'm still cut off from the uh mental phone.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, Taylor or Silus, uh,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Correct.

**Christopher Hooper:** what's status of, uh, conference call? Is

**Tyram:** Oh, I've opened it up to everyone now. Now that we're done

**Christopher Hooper:** everyone tuned in

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay, I'm gonna um kind of say something to the group

**Christopher Hooper:** now?

**Walden Briarhelm:** and has had this moment where the the concept of the blood ritual kind of is suspicious. Not based on what everything that Toeer just shared, not because of anything more than like this seems a little bit just different. Something seems different about it. And

**Tyram:** scheming

**Walden Briarhelm:** I also start to realize that since the monastery had been destroyed, uh we'd all gone on our own journey. And I have not yet asked Bafael uh like how did you get into this position? and we've kind of just been taking everything he said at his word. I'm gonna ask I think it would be Silas and Brew if they notice anything suspicious or if they have noticed anything suspicious about Bafel.

**Tyram:** Um, if you're

**Christopher Hooper:** What is

**Justin Hale:** Um, I'm not

**Tyram:** worried about the ritual thing, we had another

**Justin Hale:** going

**Tyram:** source like the tablet back in the vault that told us all the blood magic stuff. Like that's not a Raphael original

**Christopher Hooper:** it?

**Tyram:** thing. Yeah, we can roll

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, okay. With that in mind, then I

**Tyram:** inside if you want though. I mean, it's probably a good

**Walden Briarhelm:** guess I I kind of I c I I I get a weird vibe out of it. And even if that's just me wanting to overthink a character, I I I want to know. And I'm I'm blind to my own

**Justin Hale:** If you're if you're asking us though,

**Tyram:** idea.

**Walden Briarhelm:** brother.

**Justin Hale:** I will flush a genius

**Tyram:** Okay, my worst insight is going to be um uh 20. So, do you guys want me to try to bend sight on

**Christopher Hooper:** I think um why

**Walden Briarhelm:** Hello.

**Christopher Hooper:** don't you all have this in character cuz I want to know what y'all

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** are trying to to insight like is it about Bafael itself or the ritual or um you know like what you're

**Tyram:** him?

**Christopher Hooper:** trying to dig deeper into.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Um, I think I might just uh in that moment think to the group. I I need to ask Bafel a question and ask Bafel like you said that you did your own research on this. Where did you learn that this was how the ritual was supposed to

**Christopher Hooper:** I learned through the St. George books. They have, you may have noticed, they have lots of research on dragons, including this site. They even have the old strips.

**Walden Briarhelm:** go? I'm overthinking it. I need to go have a drink. I was sitting here like the Elderon would send the mercenary order of St. George to take care of this mission to go base it on this loose translation of a blood ritual to receal this orb. Like ah I'm I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** Maybe maybe maybe they got a lot of that research from them. Hard to say. Um, but what

**Walden Briarhelm:** overthinking.

**Christopher Hooper:** Bafael says to you is, "Yes, I got this from St.

**Ellis Taylor:** and Corette. Welcome

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay. I I have I I find myself torn because more than anything it is an emotional moment to be standing beside the fallen body of my my god.

**Christopher Hooper:** George.

**Walden Briarhelm:** And I if anybody else has any concerns, please share them. Otherwise, I I believe that perhaps we should just move forward. I I cannot I cannot move past my own

**Tyram:** Well, I mean, Rafael's your bro, right? We're kind of I don't know this guy at all. I was kind of deferring to you on his p on his scruples here, you know?

**Walden Briarhelm:** feelings. I'm going I will trust my gut and say that my brother would never steer us in any

**Tyram:** Oh, I don't

**Walden Briarhelm:** direction but the correct way.

**Tyram:** like that. Um, let me go ahead and roll on this

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, so

**Tyram:** guy. Uh, 30 or sorry,

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes. 30

**Walden Briarhelm:** so I fix it.

**Tyram:** 29. Yeah. Am

**Christopher Hooper:** 29 and are you getting plaster genius too? Is that

**Tyram:** I Okay.

**Justin Hale:** Oh yes.

**Christopher Hooper:** right? 33. 33 is a 33 is big. What What was the dice

**Tyram:** 33. The dice roll was a 19 and then I have a plus

**Justin Hale:** Uh

**Christopher Hooper:** roll? Dice roll is a 19 almost natural 20. Okay.

**Justin Hale:** One

**Tyram:** 10.

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. I think I think what you see in Bafhael is that he started this with just trying to get to try to get answers and he found St. George as the best way to do that because and he foresaw this moment

**Justin Hale:** What?


### [01:50:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** where he was going to have to decide himself whether he wanted to help or actively hurt St. George. But he first needed them to help him get to this site to be able to make that decision to even know whether Luna was alive or not. He didn't really know what he was going to do when he got there. Now, it's clear that he he worked very hard to gain the trust of St. George. Is clear to that. You're thinking back to the way the commander talked about him that Rafael was setting up an expedition that he was leading this and maybe helped them a little too much to find this site and put all the pieces together and put it together to to actually get here. But in that he also had a hand in being able to select who was on the ship. he had this plan to get out um once he was able to see. And now he's really struggling with the real possibility that you hold this item connected to this godly dragon that very likely has the power to uh bring back his god. and he's he's personally still struggling with that issue because it seems like a huge cost to work with and unleash and and do that to but you know he's inevitably a a monastic member that follows this this Luna godly figure. And now he sees this site, this site that uses blood magic and this orb that is made of man. And it's very against his own nature. This this nature of man to fight against the nature of the universe itself. And he is getting pushed into this. He's he's swaying into that we should not even do this ritual at all. Um that we should instead figure out a way to to find some sort of way to work with Astro and Noraxis and not to find some some balance there to not destroy their world and to return to the balance that they had before. Um, that's that's what your 33 insight check gets

**Tyram:** Okay. So, I guess I'll uh you know, now that you mention it, it does seem as though your buddy here might be having second thoughts. We might need to talk it out with him before we try the ritual.

**Christopher Hooper:** you. You're muted, but I see your lips

**Walden Briarhelm:** Thank you. Uh I I too found myself uh beside myself actually. Uh being by the body has definitely skewed the the the quest that I was on when I first

**Christopher Hooper:** moving.

**Walden Briarhelm:** arrived. I sense that Bafel too is questioning his motives at this point. At this point, I'll just speak out to Bafel and say, "Baf, are you sure about

**Christopher Hooper:** No, no. But I You have a plan. It It keeps the status quo, right? We will think about this another time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** I'm going to do the classic like hand on the shoulder with support and be like I am with you

**Christopher Hooper:** You do you feel like you can give blood freely for this ritual?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I do have my doubts, but I believe that if this is what you have learned, I can trust

**Christopher Hooper:** You trust

**Walden Briarhelm:** you. Yes, Mafia, you are one of my

**Christopher Hooper:** me? I Oh

**Walden Briarhelm:** brothers.

**Christopher Hooper:** my I I I cannot lead you to this ritual. You lead me to this ritual.

**Walden Briarhelm:** What are the uh is the uh the shuffle board tournament still occurring or have any of the uh order of St. George joined us at the bottom of the let's see

**Christopher Hooper:** Give me per second

**Ellis Taylor:** I

**Walden Briarhelm:** here. Damn

**Christopher Hooper:** check.

**Ellis Taylor:** also have a question. Tier is all about like

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Mhm.

**Ellis Taylor:** order and balance, right? Or is it more about the rule of law than or than

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, I believe it

**Ellis Taylor:** balance?

**Christopher Hooper:** is a belief that there is a structure that everything fits in that the

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm.

**Christopher Hooper:** bad and the good has its role in the universe.

**Ellis Taylor:** Mhm. Yeah. Do I have like anything where I can talk to my

**Christopher Hooper:** You can you can pray if you

**Ellis Taylor:** God? I mean, I can always I can always pray. I was just seeing if I had

**Ali Leonard:** Let's all

**Ellis Taylor:** like anything that was like talk to him

**Ali Leonard:** pray. I'll I'll call

**Ellis Taylor:** directly.

**Tyram:** Man, believing in God seems like a real pain in the ass. Well, I

**Christopher Hooper:** want.

**Ali Leonard:** Tony. Yeah, they always want to talk and it's like I'm

**Tyram:** mean, I they clearly exist. I guess the word I should do is

**Ali Leonard:** busy.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** like uh being differential to gods is seems like a real pain in the ass.

**Ellis Taylor:** I want the trickster god just to like pop up in

**Tyram:** Isn't

**Ellis Taylor:** like you think you don't think I'm

**Tyram:** the trickster god like mostly dead? Like didn't Crowley like mostly eat

**Ali Leonard:** You

**Ellis Taylor:** around. Oh, I have no idea.

**Tyram:** him? Well,

**Christopher Hooper:** Hey.

**Ali Leonard:** invented Crowley. You would know

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh my god. What if Crowley becomes the trickster

**Tyram:** Justin invented the trickster god, so I don't know that whole

**Ellis Taylor:** god?

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Tyram:** deal. Oh, is that not the same thing? Because

**Justin Hale:** that's the chaos god.

**Tyram:** I was fully assuming that was the same thing.

**Christopher Hooper:** That's the thing about chaos. God changes his name every

**Justin Hale:** The chaos god is now bringing

**Tyram:** bastard. All right. So, one thing I'm confused, how would this orb

**Christopher Hooper:** day.

**Tyram:** help revive Luna? Like, how would that even logistically

**Christopher Hooper:** That's a question tailored to toer

**Justin Hale:** balance.

**Tyram:** work? Okay. Would my

**Christopher Hooper:** or silus to the

**Tyram:** insight have really given me like such specific thing about like using the orb to help Luna or would that is that a little too specific for

**Christopher Hooper:** world. That's that's

**Ellis Taylor:** Probably.

**Christopher Hooper:** um that's not really that your insight was

**Ali Leonard:** Let's

**Tyram:** insight his

**Christopher Hooper:** into to more of um Bafael and like what was going on with

**Tyram:** out.

**Christopher Hooper:** him.

**Ali Leonard:** see. I mean, I can ask Tony if you

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, I

**Justin Hale:** Can we

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Ali Leonard:** want.

**Ellis Taylor:** can ask tier like tier like inside like tier

**Justin Hale:** hear our

**Tyram:** Okay.

**Ellis Taylor:** if you got an opinion about this whole balance s***.

**Justin Hale:** comics?

**Tyram:** I mean, by all means, looping in, you know, like I just I thought that we wanted

**Ellis Taylor:** I'd really like to

**Tyram:** to stop the dragon from waking up, but you guys, by all means,

**Ellis Taylor:** know.

**Tyram:** like, uh, let's let's get everybody on the line here and get a conference call.

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, that's

**Ali Leonard:** Let's get a conference call

**Ellis Taylor:** I mean, tier, it seems

**Christopher Hooper:** it.

**Ali Leonard:** going.

**Ellis Taylor:** like it seems like, you know, I forgot Elderan's trying to kill gods. I don't want them to kill the gods, but the dragons don't seem like the best idea either. I don't know what to

**Tyram:** Everyone

**Ellis Taylor:** do anymore.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, to that perception, um, do you see there is one Dragonite who is on board the

**Tyram:** sucks.

**Christopher Hooper:** ship probably uh like pretty far, but he seems to be like watching from the ship uh deck.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, that's good.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um as you you all are discussing and and looking for religious um guidance uh Silas at some point uh emanating from your backpack. You hear I will help you sister. This world will remember the mighty love of Luna Enoraxis. And you hear that angelic voice again. Um, are you there? Please help me. And at this point, directed to you, at you, Silus, you hear, "Do what you want, Silus. I will not be

**Tyram:** That's right. Are you Astro or Nuraxis? I'm getting confused about

**Christopher Hooper:** stopped." It doesn't

**Tyram:** that. Yeah, honestly, who the f***

**Christopher Hooper:** respond.

**Justin Hale:** Who is this?

**Tyram:** is

**Ali Leonard:** What is

**Tyram:** talking?

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, but you're uh it seems to be the same

**Tyram:** No one asked

**Christopher Hooper:** astro that's been in your your

**Tyram:** you. Shut

**Ali Leonard:** this?

**Tyram:** up. Okay, guys. It looks like it looks like it's s*** or get off

**Justin Hale:** Who is this? Oh, yeah.

**Tyram:** the pot time here, guys. You guys get your word in from your god because you need to do it right the hell

**Christopher Hooper:** orb. Um, yeah. What are

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** y'all What are y'all trying to do to What are y'all

**Justin Hale:** Hello.

**Christopher Hooper:** doing?

**Ellis Taylor:** f*** if I know I feel ill

**Christopher Hooper:** Doing some dice rolls. You want to You want to roll some

**Ellis Taylor:** informed. I'll do a dice

**Justin Hale:** And it was

**Christopher Hooper:** dice? You want to do a prayer

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah. So, first of all, I'll take out my fidget

**Ellis Taylor:** roll.

**Justin Hale:** nar. Hold on. Hold

**Ali Leonard:** spinner.

**Justin Hale:** on. Let's do this with science and

**Christopher Hooper:** circle?


### [02:00:00]

**Justin Hale:** math. Can we like check the orb? Like is it resonating the closer we are to this this moon god or like is it doing anything that we can gleam from to see like how it would

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, okay. You're you're taking this from a very scientific angle, so go and give me a arcana check. Actually, I need a bio break, too, because I need to pee. So, let's take

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** work?

**Christopher Hooper:** a let's take a fiverr.

**Justin Hale:** It's a

**Tyram:** Oh man.

**Justin Hale:** cliffhanger.

**Tyram:** What are you doing? See?

**Christopher Hooper:** Are you enjoying this, Taylor? Are you enjoying

**Tyram:** Yeah, I'm just I'm truly like I feel really lost about what we should be doing right now is all

**Christopher Hooper:** this?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I think we have to pick

**Tyram:** Well, since

**Walden Briarhelm:** an alliance and that's where it gets weird.

**Tyram:** both sides seem equally bad, I mean, I don't feel any reason

**Walden Briarhelm:** Like Yeah, I

**Tyram:** one or the

**Walden Briarhelm:** know. It's a lose lose. And I'm like, do we have

**Christopher Hooper:** No, you could carve a third

**Ellis Taylor:** agreed.

**Walden Briarhelm:** to

**Tyram:** other. Well, I feel like original plan then to just like put a stopper on all of it for right now and just try to come up with some context might be the way to go

**Christopher Hooper:** way.

**Tyram:** then.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah. I feel like I figured out Olivia's position while I was going to the bathroom is like I'm going to stick with like the wisdom of our elders and just put a stop on the dragon for now. like they knew how bad of a dude he was. They bottled him up. We've been fine ever since. So, we can we can deal with the Empire in our own time. But if it could save Luna, I would love to save Luna. I don't know if it involves destroying the orb, but

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, see that's a gamble. I don't like

**Tyram:** I had no idea that Luma was connected in

**Christopher Hooper:** or

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that gamble. Rollings.

**Tyram:** any way at all with the

**Ellis Taylor:** I think it's just a very powerful magical object and basically we can like jump start her is kind of what I'm thinking. It sounds

**Tyram:** orb.

**Christopher Hooper:** And if that's the case, then maybe there's other ways to jump starter,

**Ellis Taylor:** like Yeah,

**Christopher Hooper:** too.

**Ellis Taylor:** it's true. Do we have any powerful magical items we want to sacrifice? Not my cursed bl. I don't know what that's going to do to her.

**Tyram:** It's not like you use it. Yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** Stab her with the

**Ellis Taylor:** That sounds like a bad idea.

**Tyram:** As far as like cosmic level, I think we just have the orb right

**Christopher Hooper:** cursed

**Walden Briarhelm:** Clear.

**Tyram:** now.

**Christopher Hooper:** blade.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah, I don't I don't

**Christopher Hooper:** I think

**Walden Briarhelm:** have anything

**Christopher Hooper:** um I don't think it's giving too much to say that like if violescence has the power to like down a god then who

**Tyram:** Well, like we know

**Christopher Hooper:** knows what it could be used for,

**Ellis Taylor:** That's true. Well, we use our

**Walden Briarhelm:** fancy.

**Tyram:** that Um, yeah, we know

**Christopher Hooper:** right?

**Ellis Taylor:** perfect violesence orb on her instead of the dragon orb. We've got multiple

**Tyram:** that Eldora has like basically become like a maybe call it like a hedge god

**Ellis Taylor:** orbs.

**Tyram:** where like she's able to bring together violescence but also at this point like genuine worship to like boost her up to god status, right? So, but we also know that vi concentrating too much violescence in one place could lead to a catastrophic situation like with the time gun. Like the time gun, the whole reason that that blew up the universe that you showed us was that they put too much power in one spot, right? And that might be what happens if Eldora continues her ambitions. So, we need to stop Eldora. There is no situation where Eldora's plans are anything but bad. But dealing with these dragons and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well, that means

**Tyram:** everything also seems like a bad idea, too, because the dragons are also total dicks. Like they burned out like high forge like

**Walden Briarhelm:** that Well, like I I'm

**Tyram:** that.

**Walden Briarhelm:** recalling I think it was a recording. You held Silas held the

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.


### [02:10:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** dragon orb and the human forms of the dragons all the way back at I Forge. They like I don't want to say they were intimidated, but like they cons they they respected you when you showed that you had the power to like bear it. And I don't know if that was recording or not or if that was a fever dream. Like I think I

**Tyram:** Um, not so much

**Christopher Hooper:** Mhm.

**Ellis Taylor:** H that was when we had the

**Walden Briarhelm:** recall that like

**Tyram:** like that was less I think a situation of respecting Silus and more

**Ellis Taylor:** car, the Bugatti.

**Tyram:** a situation where like they know that the orb can be used to compel them to do

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** s***. which

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay.

**Tyram:** I haven't really used except to make the Well, I've used it a couple of times. I used it to make the dra actually Actually, no, I think I've only used the dragon compulsion thing one time, and that was to get the dragons to leave High

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, okay. So I I I think I strang together thoughts in the loose way. What if

**Tyram:** Forge.

**Walden Briarhelm:** we the sides might be maybe we're not looking out far enough. Maybe the sides aren't between what we've looked at. Maybe it's Elderon and by extension the St. George versus the dragons. Like they are all against dragons. But you have like a literal remote control for like dragons do

**Tyram:** using it. The reason why Silus isn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** this kind of thing. So

**Tyram:** just going around like dropping dragons on everyone is because using it is dangerous. Like the more I use it, the more

**Walden Briarhelm:** it is

**Tyram:** likely it is that Astro just breaks the bonds and comes out and I think eats the world. I don't know. It seemed like a bad thing for the Astro to get

**Walden Briarhelm:** it something cataclysmic. Yes. Okay. So, we can't just

**Tyram:** out. No.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay, I have a

**Walden Briarhelm:** rely on the orb, but we could

**Tyram:** Um, as far as I can tell, like the orb is

**Walden Briarhelm:** use do

**Tyram:** a break glass in case of emergency type of thing. If it ever gets used at all, it should definitely not be used as

**Ellis Taylor:** vote.

**Tyram:** option A for any

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. Do I I'm I'm having another memory gap here. If the

**Tyram:** circumstance.

**Walden Briarhelm:** dragons show up and the order starts trying to fight them and we just fight the order, the dragons aren't going to be like, "Oh, cool. We have ad or we have like uh allies." They're just going to be like, "Oh, look, more things to fight." Correct. They're not going to feel like we're an

**Tyram:** That's hard to say because

**Christopher Hooper:** Dragons are dragons are

**Walden Briarhelm:** alliance

**Tyram:** dragons Yeah, dragons are smart. So like that

**Christopher Hooper:** intelligent.

**Walden Briarhelm:** with

**Tyram:** is Iro um lives in

**Ellis Taylor:** Where's

**Walden Briarhelm:** f***.

**Tyram:** Greatort. He lives out of

**Ellis Taylor:** Iro? Okay. Is he still

**Tyram:** Fluke. Well, actually that's something we might explore. I have a oneshot idea for Iro.

**Ellis Taylor:** small? Okay. So, I mean, we know

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** So

**Ellis Taylor:** that there are good dragons in the world. I I mean, us

**Tyram:** I mean, it's not I think it's

**Ellis Taylor:** players, not our characters

**Tyram:** common knowledge that like even beyond the whole like

**Ellis Taylor:** necessarily.

**Tyram:** uh individual dragon alignment thing, there are like dragons

**Ellis Taylor:** That's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Well,

**Tyram:** that are typically good and dragons that are typically bad with like metallic

**Ellis Taylor:** true. Yeah. Or like the gold dragon we fought, the

**Tyram:** versus

**Ellis Taylor:** zombie gold dragon we fought that one time.

**Walden Briarhelm:** You zombie gold

**Christopher Hooper:** Just do something.

**Walden Briarhelm:** dragon. You guys have so many tidbits of cool ass s*** you've done.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, but he was good. We healed him and then

**Walden Briarhelm:** They're just like, "No, we just called a zombie.

**Ellis Taylor:** he was like went to he went because gold dragons are good

**Tyram:** Gold dragons are the strongest good dragons.

**Ellis Taylor:** dragons, but he was zombified. Yeah. And so we our solution was to heal him and then he like went in

**Tyram:** Yes.

**Ellis Taylor:** peace. Oh, he died in

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, nice. All right.

**Ellis Taylor:** peace. Yeah.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Okay. Well, we don't need to use the dragon orb, but merely having it in your presence around these dragons and us fighting adjacent to them along their side. Perhaps that would be enough for us to be able

**Christopher Hooper:** Um,

**Walden Briarhelm:** to No,

**Tyram:** I think if we have an ambition

**Walden Briarhelm:** it's whole f****** army. It's an empire.

**Tyram:** to try to team up with dragons, we have to make that a proactive plan. I don't think we can count on them like just like, oh, hey, they're fighting Georgees. Let's team up. I think we have to do the recruitment. like we have to propose the alliance, you

**Walden Briarhelm:** Is

**Tyram:** know, but also we are like

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Tyram:** the plan A, as far as I'm aware, is still to like trap their god more thoroughly. So, they might not like

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, and one thing that I was looking back at, um, I believe

**Tyram:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** that the like legend that you got about Astro like consuming the world and

**Walden Briarhelm:** that

**Christopher Hooper:** and that all comes from from the tablets and I don't believe it comes directly from her. Um, just wanted to clear that

**Ellis Taylor:** Who

**Christopher Hooper:** up.

**Ellis Taylor:** is her? Oh,

**Tyram:** Astro is the sister

**Ellis Taylor:** Astro's the female.

**Tyram:** of the dragon who is the boyfriend of Luna.

**Christopher Hooper:** Astro.

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. Oh, lord. So, who's in the who's in the

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** orb?

**Christopher Hooper:** Astros.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Astro. The orb that Silus is carrying has Astro, who is

**Christopher Hooper:** is there's

**Ellis Taylor:** I need a family tree. I'm sorry.

**Walden Briarhelm:** the

**Christopher Hooper:** three there's three

**Ellis Taylor:** Okay. No, there's

**Walden Briarhelm:** sister and one of

**Ellis Taylor:** not. I can't swear there's

**Walden Briarhelm:** them. I I feel like a simple

**Ellis Taylor:** 15.

**Walden Briarhelm:** just a simple drawing or diagram would help. Two

**Ellis Taylor:** No,

**Walden Briarhelm:** dragons and a moon. One of the dragons like, "Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** characters.

**Ellis Taylor:** there's three

**Walden Briarhelm:** yeah.

**Christopher Hooper:** It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, no, no, no,

**Ellis Taylor:** dragons. I really want to know the

**Walden Briarhelm:** no. We're gonna lose our

**Ellis Taylor:** logistics of a female moon goddess and and a

**Walden Briarhelm:** spot. Whoa. You're getting You're These are gods.

**Ellis Taylor:** dragon.

**Walden Briarhelm:** They love in a way that's beyond the physical mental abilities of

**Tyram:** I mean, even if we're just talking like

**Christopher Hooper:** It's

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, that's true. I mean, Zeus did

**Walden Briarhelm:** us meet people.

**Ellis Taylor:** get pregnant somewhere by becoming a shower of gold.

**Tyram:** physiology, I feel like both of them can eat just look like whatever they want to look like anyway. So, yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** So,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Sure. You're in a We in a

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Christopher Hooper:** that uh Reddit I linked is is not safe

**Walden Briarhelm:** weird

**Christopher Hooper:** for work. Uh so just

**Walden Briarhelm:** So, I can't click

**Christopher Hooper:** but Yeah, it's on

**Ellis Taylor:** Is it on

**Walden Briarhelm:** server. Megan's

**Justin Hale:** wait. What? Why does this exist?

**Walden Briarhelm:** cars. I am so so glad I'm

**Ellis Taylor:** Discord?

**Walden Briarhelm:** doing. Yes, I'm over 18. Am I going to regret

**Ellis Taylor:** NSFW. It's still not showing

**Walden Briarhelm:** it? Hell yeah. First post first

**Tyram:** Yeah, penis part two is our first

**Christopher Hooper:** Discord.

**Ellis Taylor:** it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** penis part

**Tyram:** uh our first look

**Walden Briarhelm:** two. It is an

**Tyram:** here. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't

**Walden Briarhelm:** excellent drawing. I mean, this is

**Tyram:** that.

**Ellis Taylor:** It's way better than what I was

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, honestly, I'm kind of that is

**Tyram:** Oh, hey, they do have

**Walden Briarhelm:** now in my forever algorithm. My internet

**Tyram:** Caliggo Myasma of Night f****** an ice vehicle. So, hey, you know, I can get behind that. And apparently the dragon can get behind this ice vehicle.

**Ellis Taylor:** expecting. Okay. So, back on task. What is everyone's opinion right now before we get back into

**Tyram:** So, I like the don't choose a faction and

**Walden Briarhelm:** fingerprint. Oh my

**Justin Hale:** My opinion is should not have the

**Tyram:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** it? Yeah, to s*** out loud. That's just a given.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Ma's opinion is they don't like St. George guys. We all hate the Elderon

**Justin Hale:** internet.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Empire, but I have nothing against the dragons and I my interests are in my goddess Luna right now. Uh it sounds like if we do this ritual, we're going to better secure the existing dragon orb with Astro in it and potentially in the process of the ritual like shock the goddess back to life. So he is like we should probably do the ritual and see what happens. But if the dragons show up because we started doing some crazy magical s***, we should fight alongside

**Christopher Hooper:** It

**Walden Briarhelm:** them. So that's

**Ellis Taylor:** All All right.

**Walden Briarhelm:** my What is

**Ellis Taylor:** Olivia thinks she doesn't trust the dragons and she

**Walden Briarhelm:** Olivia's?

**Ellis Taylor:** hates Aldorin. I definitely don't want the dra let the dragon out quite yet until we understand

**Christopher Hooper:** is

**Ellis Taylor:** more. Um but she's definitely on team get the real moon back. Um whether or not that involves the the orb and the ritual or if we are using the violescence that we would be re using for the ritual to revive her like it might be an eitheror type thing like instead of using the perfect violescence spear for the ritual we use it to revive the goddess. I vote that because we still have time on the dragon orb and reviving the goddess gets my real moon back and puts

**Tyram:** Even if we

**Ellis Taylor:** back Eldor and like puts them a step

**Tyram:** brought back Luna, couldn't Eldora just shoot her with a moon laser

**Ellis Taylor:** back. Oh,

**Tyram:** again?

**Ellis Taylor:** hopefully she'll be smarter about

**Tyram:** Being a moon in the sky? I don't know what her is

**Walden Briarhelm:** That's kind of a really

**Tyram:** here.

**Walden Briarhelm:** good point. f***. Like, yeah. What's going to stop


### [02:20:00]

**Tyram:** I mean, clearly she lost the fight. Would she be She'd only be in worse shape

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm still team get the moon real moon

**Walden Briarhelm:** him? Maybe we heal her enough to like a semi powerful god in like a form that is our ally that just comes with us

**Tyram:** now. Yo, hey, you maybe after we finish. Okay,

**Ellis Taylor:** back. What if we just have like a weak god join

**Tyram:** so it seems like Astro is kind of like giving us a shot clock right now. Let's deal with her and then we could maybe just talk to Luna. You know, maybe she can tell us if like what the what's what's the idea

**Ellis Taylor:** us? It's true. We haven't talked to her yet.

**Walden Briarhelm:** everywhere.

**Justin Hale:** Oh,

**Ellis Taylor:** She's just been talking this whole

**Justin Hale:** wait. I did an arcana trick before we

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, what

**Ellis Taylor:** time. Oh, yeah.

**Justin Hale:** cliffhangered. Did we? I rolled

**Tyram:** here?

**Christopher Hooper:** was

**Justin Hale:** a 19 uh plus eight. So,

**Christopher Hooper:** your seven? Okay. And uh, do you want to keep it at

**Justin Hale:** 27.

**Christopher Hooper:** that?

**Justin Hale:** What? You know

**Walden Briarhelm:** The 27's crazy already.

**Justin Hale:** what?

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** Uh, no. f*** it. I don't use flash of genius enough. So, no. It's going to be now because of your attitude. It's

**Walden Briarhelm:** Does

**Justin Hale:** gonna be a

**Tyram:** f***

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. No, it's just asking the

**Walden Briarhelm:** Brew

**Justin Hale:** 31.

**Tyram:** yourself.

**Christopher Hooper:** question.

**Walden Briarhelm:** does does Brew take Flash of Genius? like as literally as he takes like the telephone thing and he like flashes his little goblin nipples if you flash

**Ellis Taylor:** She's

**Walden Briarhelm:** genius cuz like I would imagine that's appropriate for a little goblin dude to be doing and it's

**Ellis Taylor:** like, he's a

**Walden Briarhelm:** brew if if not then that's on recording and everybody can just roast me about

**Ellis Taylor:** little He has a little light bulb hat he puts on.

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** And he puts it on his

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. I like

**Justin Hale:** Thank you.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, so

**Ellis Taylor:** friends.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that more.

**Christopher Hooper:** you are trying to figure out

**Justin Hale:** If if we like is the orb different the closer we get to the fallen goddess? Is there anything else like weird going around? I'm like I'm crazy

**Christopher Hooper:** what Mhm.

**Justin Hale:** perceptive anyway. So like, you know, mash those two things mash together. I've got to notice something,

**Christopher Hooper:** So you're so you're so you're studying like how this site and this goddess and this orb like scientifically are like working together, right? Or like how these are interacting. Is that is that kind of what

**Justin Hale:** right? I mean, I'm

**Christopher Hooper:** you're

**Justin Hale:** I'm, you know, I'm trying to do

**Tyram:** How much

**Justin Hale:** things. That's all I

**Tyram:** clearer could he be?

**Christopher Hooper:** a lot. It could be a lot

**Justin Hale:** got. No, you have to be

**Christopher Hooper:** clearer. Okay, I'll start with

**Justin Hale:** clearer. I come 90, you come

**Tyram:** To

**Christopher Hooper:** this. I'll start with this and and you and you can ask follow-ups if you need. So everyone around you

**Justin Hale:** 10.

**Christopher Hooper:** discussion philosophical religious going on and Brew is it just kind of like takes this orb off Silus and starts like walking around like going different distances

**Justin Hale:** Yep.

**Tyram:** What?


### [02:30:00]

**Christopher Hooper:** uh with it. And um something you learn, you you picked up something from that relay and you've been seeing these like sensors around the site and um what you gather that this relay system does is it measures um like to to uh brew. He has a um mental model of uh the magic that exists in this world comes from the weave uh which interconnects um things and it's how um like interacting with the weave is how um you're able to imbue different magical effects. And what that relates to is basically crossing various boundaries between uh the realities and um you know that there are different planes of existence and the weave uh when you interact with the weave you're able to connect these threads through those planes and connect them to other planes of existence. what the the gods do and what makes them godly is the fact that they exist across plains. And um for us they are gods because they represent a um connection to one of those like core planes that represents um some aspect of our reality. Whether it's the aspect of chaos and structure or fire and wind or um like life and nature and um construction um like all these different aspects of our world. There are actual planes that are dedicated to those and the gods are able to serve as bridges between those. Um something you see something you've experienced already is um you know with Cwley and Joel and and Caspian is and others is connections with uh the the plane of the fay which is much closer to our mortal mortal realm than any of the other planes and like heavily influence where we are. All that's to say, when you have this orb, it's a little bit like a uh it's a little bit like putting up a door where normally a being would be crossing and freely interacting. Instead, they are stifled um to interact here. And still elements of that being are able to seep through like cold air uh through a leaky door, but they're not able to connect all the way through with a pure essence. Now, what you're able to see even through proximity is that there is an immense power coming from this orb. One that as you bring closer to various parts of this this fallen uh Luna, you see that there is an effect on the world. Now, what's odd about this is what you know about Astro, it's a being of the void. Um so where most power is imbued and um creates more energy, this one kind of pulls energy in a very interesting way. Um almost like in the way like a black hole will will pull towards it. Um but in return it is you do see it's able to imbue um uh by choice but it's latent state as you measure is to pull to pull energy and and power towards it matter even um you you see it almost as like um like heat escaping through the cracks of a window. Uh it's very minimal, but it it leaks through um even through this orb. All that said, what is it? What is its effect on this god, this altar? Um, as you get to the altar, odd things are happening. It's almost like, um, inversions are happening. As you bring the orb towards the altar, it begins to start spewing energy almost an inverse in the way that it was sucking in other parts. Um you even get um as you walk the corpse of Luna, you get different elements. You know, what is the power of the moon? What is the moon imbuing? But even that sort of like very esoteric understanding of what a moon god could be seems to invert as you get closer to the altar. And it seems like this point is probably a what you kind of are evaluating is that maybe this point is some sort of like like teeter totter in a way that you were able to uh affect the the balance of things and redistribute them at this point. And that's what your that's what your experiments as you're as you're walking around are. Do you have any other questions based on

**Justin Hale:** So when you were mentioning that pull, you were saying that's pulling towards the orb or away from the orb towards

**Christopher Hooper:** that?

**Justin Hale:** the goddess.

**Christopher Hooper:** So, normally away from the altar, the orb is just pulling like scant amounts of of matter and energy, basically treating them equal. Um, as you get to um really the the core of the fallen goddess, you you actually see the orb shoot out these like blasts of energy. Um, and they seem to like kind of like cast over over the skeleton and and it's almost like um like a Roman candle where it goes and then like dissipates dissipates and then but as you move towards the altar you get this like weird inversion in and in in activity from the orb totally is just very

**Justin Hale:** Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** unpredictable.

**Justin Hale:** Does it does that uh was it noticeable if that like pulse towards the goddess was stronger the closer we got to

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah, it's very

**Justin Hale:** it. Okay. And the closer we get to the altar, it gets more

**Christopher Hooper:** directed.

**Justin Hale:** sporadic. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Tyram:** Oops.

**Justin Hale:** Okay. I mean, that's that was my biggest question. I forgot the last part that you said, so I can't

**Christopher Hooper:** here. Yeah, same. Hope it hopefully it was

**Justin Hale:** remember what my other question

**Christopher Hooper:** transcribed. Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** uh was it was when you were by Luna's body, the energy was expelling outwards from the

**Justin Hale:** was.

**Walden Briarhelm:** orb and little like flares of energy, but as you approached the actual ritual site, now it seems to have inversed and it's I guess in that case absorbing

**Christopher Hooper:** yeah, so it was absorbing before and spewing as it gets as it gets to the ritual

**Ellis Taylor:** spewing and

**Christopher Hooper:** circle. Mhm.

**Ellis Taylor:** it's spewing.

**Justin Hale:** It's spewing.

**Ellis Taylor:** It's sucking

**Walden Briarhelm:** energy.

**Justin Hale:** She's

**Ellis Taylor:** when it's away. in.

**Justin Hale:** the car in this in this

**Christopher Hooper:** Yep.

**Justin Hale:** metaphor. Um, okay then. I'm gonna I'm gonna tell Well, I'm going to tell everybody what I noticed, but more but like most specifically to

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah.

**Justin Hale:** um I'll I'll say Um, I feel like Rafael's reservation here seems valid. It It feels like the orb wants to be close to the goddess's body, not this weird alter

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, what uh what what are you seeing that makes you say that? What what do I not

**Justin Hale:** thing. There's like energy or something weird happening with the orb that it wants to go towards the skeleton thing, not towards the altitude. Like when it gets closer to the alter, it gets all gets all warbly and

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, should we uh should we tell Raphael?

**Justin Hale:** weird.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Bafel. Bafel.

**Justin Hale:** Probably

**Christopher Hooper:** Yes, what?

**Walden Briarhelm:** Wait. Wait. There is something. There is something strange happening with the

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay. What is happening with you

**Walden Briarhelm:** oil. As you approach the

**Christopher Hooper:** all?

**Walden Briarhelm:** ritual site, the the energy seems

**Justin Hale:** What the f***?

**Walden Briarhelm:** chaotic. And when you are closer to Luna's body, it seemed to have a more balanced uh interaction with its

**Christopher Hooper:** What are you even talking about

**Walden Briarhelm:** surroundings.

**Christopher Hooper:** right

**Walden Briarhelm:** Bafel, I I feel that perhaps the OB is going to it is not going to interact as we expect if you if we do the

**Christopher Hooper:** now? What do we expect?

**Walden Briarhelm:** ritual. I I feel something bad is going to

**Tyram:** I mean, Astro doesn't want us to do it. Maybe it's just

**Walden Briarhelm:** happen.

**Tyram:** Astro throwing a fit when we go towards the altar. That seems to be perfectly in line with what what I would have expected to happen.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay. Once again, Silus seems to have great intuition. I I do agree with

**Tyram:** Tell me if I'm misreading the situation here, but this all seems to confirm

**Christopher Hooper:** This is why he is your

**Walden Briarhelm:** him.

**Tyram:** what we

**Walden Briarhelm:** No, no. I I just needed to hear it, I guess.

**Christopher Hooper:** leader.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh Buff, I may have spoken too soon. I perhaps I am just very scared for the situation and uncertain of what will

**Tyram:** thought.

**Walden Briarhelm:** happen

**Ellis Taylor:** How do you think this orb is going to

**Walden Briarhelm:** next.

**Ellis Taylor:** resurrect your moon goddess? How do you thinking that

**Christopher Hooper:** What's are

**Ellis Taylor:** happens? Are you

**Walden Briarhelm:** like the the like the paddle George Clooney used. It's just like

**Christopher Hooper:** you my

**Ellis Taylor:** saying I mean my my question is is he thinking that we instead of putting the orb on the altar essentially we put the goddess on the altar and do and use the violesence to revive her think part of the ritual is going to revive

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. I don't know. I

**Ellis Taylor:** her or like the orb the dragon in

**Christopher Hooper:** don't I don't know it.

**Walden Briarhelm:** that.

**Christopher Hooper:** I I think the ritual is for

**Tyram:** If you just need

**Christopher Hooper:** binding. But there is power in the orb itself.

**Tyram:** a battery, what if we went and we stole something from

**Justin Hale:** It's

**Tyram:** Eldora and used it to help Luna? stole one of her artifacts, one of her items of power. I feel like that's two birds with one

**Justin Hale:** cracked.

**Ellis Taylor:** As long as Luna makes long enough, we could do

**Christopher Hooper:** We do need to destroy the

**Ellis Taylor:** that.

**Tyram:** stone. That's

**Christopher Hooper:** god gun.

**Tyram:** also true. Reviving Luna is just setting her up to get shot again right now.

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, it would put a big damper on their followers. Oh, the

**Tyram:** It could be. And also it would

**Ellis Taylor:** moon's back. The real moon's

**Justin Hale:** That'll

**Tyram:** put a big damper on her followers, Eldero's followers, if we were to like pill for one of her holy artifacts, you know, be like, "Oh, I

**Ellis Taylor:** back. Or

**Tyram:** guess Ela is not all that hot s*** anymore."

**Ellis Taylor:** if we use whatever's powering the moon gun. What if we use

**Justin Hale:** work.

**Ellis Taylor:** whatever's powering the like whatever the superpower thing that's powering the god shooting

**Tyram:** Yeah, that could. Yeah, that's it. Now, if it's on the

**Ellis Taylor:** gun and we use it to revive

**Tyram:** moon, I don't know how we get there, but

**Ellis Taylor:** Luna. It's not a real moon.

**Tyram:** um it's still in space, whatever it

**Ellis Taylor:** It's fine. Is it in space or is it just look like it's in space? It's really just kind of like a

**Tyram:** is. Do we know how to get there? Because that's the

**Ellis Taylor:** hovercraft that they've sized perfectly.

**Tyram:** bottom line here. Okay. So, it's a

**Ali Leonard:** Jasper does. So

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I don't

**Ali Leonard:** we can ask Jasper.

**Ellis Taylor:** know. That's true. We can ask Jasper and we know where he

**Christopher Hooper:** Oh, okay. Where's Jasper?

**Walden Briarhelm:** I feel

**Justin Hale:** There's a

**Christopher Hooper:** Okay, good enough for me.

**Ellis Taylor:** is.

**Walden Briarhelm:** like I feel

**Justin Hale:** friend. Sounds a

**Tyram:** midpoint. Cool. Okay. So, we can kind of all get what we want

**Justin Hale:** lot like

**Tyram:** here. To hell with his dragon. We f*** over Eldora and then we use that to help Luna. Okay, everyone

**Walden Briarhelm:** like Yeah.

**Tyram:** cool. Let's do the

**Ellis Taylor:** I'm

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yes. Let's

**Tyram:** ritual. Say

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, does anyone want to help me with the salt?

**Ellis Taylor:** cool. 3 hours

**Walden Briarhelm:** do

**Justin Hale:** you.

**Christopher Hooper:** Will anyone help me make this salt? This bag is very

**Ellis Taylor:** later. I thought you said make the salt

**Walden Briarhelm:** it. Of

**Ellis Taylor:** and I was like wait hold

**Walden Briarhelm:** course, almost

**Justin Hale:** That's what

**Tyram:** what? Yeah. I need one of the beef

**Christopher Hooper:** heavy.

**Walden Briarhelm:** steps up and

**Tyram:** cakes to do

**Christopher Hooper:** Um

**Walden Briarhelm:** helps. I like that there's more than

**Tyram:** that. I like how uh Silus is kind of like cordoned

**Walden Briarhelm:** one

**Tyram:** off everyone in the party. They're either nerds or jocks. And

**Justin Hale:** I

**Tyram:** Silus is not part of either

**Christopher Hooper:** um

**Ellis Taylor:** on is like I'm the

**Tyram:** group.

**Ellis Taylor:** cool one and like sweeps his little bangs over his

**Justin Hale:** He's the

**Tyram:** Yeah. I'm just picturing Silus

**Christopher Hooper:** that's

**Walden Briarhelm:** All I think is Revenge of the

**Tyram:** if we're doing like high school stereotypes. He's more just like

**Walden Briarhelm:** Nerds.

**Tyram:** the like the weasel kid who's always trying to like

**Justin Hale:** hipster.

**Tyram:** like game the system for his own. I don't know. I don't know. That's Silus defies these stereotypes that the rest have completely

**Ellis Taylor:** face. He's like, I don't fit in the stereotype.

**Walden Briarhelm:** and there's the oneshot idea. Everybody's a Saturday detention as their teenage

**Tyram:** embrac episode. Okay.

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah.

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh my gosh. Breakfast

**Walden Briarhelm:** son. Hell yeah. Even young

**Tyram:** Okay. Well,

**Christopher Hooper:** Nice.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Olivia shows up with

**Justin Hale:** What's the

**Tyram:** the relative age of all the different party members would make it completely

**Justin Hale:** the director of all that

**Tyram:** impossible for us to all be in high school at the same

**Ellis Taylor:** cup. It would have to be like some sort of like


### [02:40:00]

**Walden Briarhelm:** bagels. Oh, no. This is

**Ellis Taylor:** alt universe Crowley does it again or

**Walden Briarhelm:** a Yeah, it's a it's a television

**Ellis Taylor:** something.

**Walden Briarhelm:** show universe from different timelines.

**Tyram:** time. You know what? Fair enough. If somebody really wants to make

**Walden Briarhelm:** Everybody's just pulled in and it just

**Tyram:** it happen, there's magical shenanigans, but let's do this f******

**Walden Briarhelm:** happens. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do the

**Tyram:** ritual. All right. Okay. So, I also like uh

**Walden Briarhelm:** original. We've We've finished our

**Tyram:** are we had some perfectly spherical violescence orbs, right? Does but like

**Ellis Taylor:** Yeah, we got some

**Tyram:** uh Rafael has his own, but we also have the ones we took from

**Christopher Hooper:** Yeah. Thank

**Tyram:** Victor's uh factory back in High Forge. Do we only need Can we keep the ones that we have then because they're pretty

**Christopher Hooper:** you.

**Tyram:** valuable.

**Ellis Taylor:** Well, we're going to need them for the rest of the Dragon

**Tyram:** Good. Oh, you're right. Well, whatever.

**Ellis Taylor:** Balls,

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh the

**Tyram:** We'll hold on to them for

**Ellis Taylor:** right?

**Justin Hale:** Wyvern orbs. They're wyvern

**Tyram:** now. It's just so fun to

**Christopher Hooper:** Sure.

**Walden Briarhelm:** dragon Yeah.

**Tyram:** say Dragon Balls, though.

**Christopher Hooper:** All

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh uh what uh we we've completed

**Justin Hale:** orbs.

**Tyram:** All right. So, now we need blood. And we've done the

**Walden Briarhelm:** our salt stuff.

**Tyram:** orb, so we just need blood at this point,

**Christopher Hooper:** right. Uh yeah. So you place the four orbs on the mantles and you uh lay out the seven circles of salt. Um and before you is the altar with the

**Tyram:** right?

**Christopher Hooper:** bowl and um to contain blood freely

**Tyram:** All right. Silus does something

**Justin Hale:** freely

**Tyram:** he almost never does and takes out a real dagger instead of one of his psychic

**Justin Hale:** given

**Tyram:** daggers. All

**Christopher Hooper:** given

**Tyram:** right. It's a rare

**Justin Hale:** s***. Whoa. I almost never see him do

**Tyram:** occurrence. Normally psychic daggers do everything I need just fine.

**Christopher Hooper:** Um, you see the blood

**Justin Hale:** this.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh fall into the bowl and then collect into like a single like like droplet condensed droplet of blood almost like uh what's that like metallic liquid like mercury, right?

**Ellis Taylor:** Mercury

**Christopher Hooper:** Um yeah, like coaleses. Um and you see it uh shaking. Um anyone else

**Ellis Taylor:** here.

**Christopher Hooper:** uh giving their blood

**Justin Hale:** That seems kind of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Uh, Ma steps up and like does the classic tough guy thing and like bites his thumb and gets that little and squirts a little blood in.

**Christopher Hooper:** freely? All right. And it does the same. It collects and and it gets larger and larger. Um, it be it begins to

**Justin Hale:** gross.

**Christopher Hooper:** ripple. Um, uh, I think you're going to have to fill this thing

**Walden Briarhelm:** Okay.

**Justin Hale:** What do we have here? You said we need

**Christopher Hooper:** up. I think we need as much as we can

**Ali Leonard:** I'll give

**Ellis Taylor:** Oh, f*** it.

**Justin Hale:** seven. I

**Ali Leonard:** some and take it with

**Ellis Taylor:** Fine.

**Walden Briarhelm:** Yeah. How does Elsa

**Justin Hale:** mean, half the people here are little

**Christopher Hooper:** get.

**Ali Leonard:** you. Don't

**Walden Briarhelm:** do it though?

**Justin Hale:** that

**Ali Leonard:** worry about

**Walden Briarhelm:** Oh, like how does she get she just she just

**Ali Leonard:** it. It's already bleeding and you're like, "How is it

**Walden Briarhelm:** walks up and there's more blood in

**Ali Leonard:** bleeding?" Her hands are so

**Walden Briarhelm:** it.

**Tyram:** If Alison were still here, she just do like a f*** ton of

**Walden Briarhelm:** Very salty.

**Tyram:** cocaine, I guess, real quick and make her nose

**Ali Leonard:** chapped.

**Justin Hale:** Well, is everybody doing

**Tyram:** bleed. No, just the cool

**Christopher Hooper:** Everyone's doing it except you, Brew.

**Ali Leonard:** This is the gross thing you

**Justin Hale:** it?

**Tyram:** people.

**Ali Leonard:** don't agree

**Ellis Taylor:** Mommy, you do not have to jump off the bridge with the rest of us. It's okay

**Ali Leonard:** to. Oh my

**Ellis Taylor:** if you're uncomfortable. It has to be freely

**Justin Hale:** Uh, it's not really that it's gross. I just I don't know what's going to happen

**Ellis Taylor:** given. I know. Me neither. I was kind of really hoping silence would be enough,

**Tyram:** Oh, okay. I see how it

**Ellis Taylor:** but

**Walden Briarhelm:** How do you How are you going to love that?

**Justin Hale:** here.

**Ali Leonard:** god.

**Ellis Taylor:** No, I mean you're you're already good at resisting

**Justin Hale:** Um,

**Tyram:** is.

**Ellis Taylor:** the dragon. I figured all of the blood stuff would be

**Ali Leonard:** Yeah, this probably isn't going to end well,

**Justin Hale:** Bruce quite literally flips a coin uh and it lands on heads and he goes, "All right, I guess it's fine." And

**Ellis Taylor:** fine.

**Justin Hale:** just pours it

**Walden Briarhelm:** pours it. What is Was it in a

**Ali Leonard:** but

**Ellis Taylor:** You

**Walden Briarhelm:** container? You had your own blood in a like some sort

**Justin Hale:** in.

**Tyram:** You

**Ellis Taylor:** know, you know, Brew, if we thought this through a little bit Battery.

**Walden Briarhelm:** of Oh. Oh, you you

**Justin Hale:** No, he he cut his he cut

**Tyram:** know,

**Ali Leonard:** I thought you just had like an extra P in case you got stabbed
